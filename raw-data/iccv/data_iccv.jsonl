We are motivated by two key observations. First, large variation exists in motion patterns associated with various types of objects being manipulated, thus manually defining motion primitives is infeasible. Second, some motion patterns are shared among different objects being manipulated while others are object specific. We therefore propose a nonparametric Bayesian method that adopts a hierarchical Dirichlet process prior to learn representative manipulation (motion) patterns in an unsupervised manner. Taking easy-to-obtain object detection score maps and dense motion trajectories as inputs, the proposed probabilistic model can discover motion pattern groups associated with different types of objects being manipulated with a shared manipulation pattern dictionary. The size of the learned dictionary is automatically inferred. Comprehensive experiments on two assisted living benchmarks and a cooking motion dataset demonstrate superiority of our learned manipulation pattern dictionary in representing manipulation actions for recognition."}

In our formulation, the number of targets is implicitly inferred together with the data association, effectively solving data association and model selection as a single inference problem. The novel formulation allows us to interpret data association and tracking as a single Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS). We compute an approximate posterior solution to this problem using a dynamic programming/message passing technique. This inference-based approach allows us to incorporate richer probabilistic models into the tracking system. In particular, we incorporate inference over inliers/outliers and track termination times into the system. We evaluate our approach on publicly available datasets and demonstrate results competitive with, and in some cases exceeding the state of the art."}

However, attribute rank learning often requires a substantial amount of relational supervision, which is highly tedious, and apparently impractical for realworld applications. In this paper, we introduce the Semantic Transform, which under minimal supervision, adaptively finds a semantic feature space along with a class ordering that is related in the best possible way. Such a semantic space is found for every attribute category. To relate the classes under weak supervision, the class ordering needs to be refined according to a cost function in an iterative procedure. This problem is ideally NP-hard, and we thus propose a constrained search tree formulation for the same. Driven by the adaptive semantic feature space representation, our model achieves the best results to date for all of the tasks of relative, absolute and zero-shot classification on two popular datasets."}

The recently proposed PatchMatch stereo algorithm [7] overcomes this limitation of previous algorithms by directly estimating planes. This work presents a method that integrates the PatchMatch stereo algorithm into a variational smoothing formulation using quadratic relaxation. The resulting algorithm allows the explicit regularization of the disparity and normal gradients using the estimated plane parameters. Evaluation of our method in the Middlebury benchmark shows that our method outperforms the traditional integer-valued disparity strategy as well as the original algorithm and its variants in sub-pixel accurate disparity estimation."}

For the nearest neighbors problem, we propose a c-approximate solution for the restricted version of the decision problem with bounded radius which is then reduced to the nearest neighbors by a known reduction. For range searching we propose a scheme that learns the parameters in a learning stage adopting them to the case of a set of points with low intrinsic dimension that are embedded in high dimensional space (common scenario for image point descriptors). We compare our algorithms to the best known methods for these problems, i.e. LSH, ANN and FLANN. We show analytically and experimentally that we can do better for moderate approximation factor. Our algorithms are trivial to parallelize. In the experiments conducted, running on couple of million images, our algorithms show meaningful speed-ups when compared with the above mentioned methods."}

As the target (person) moves, distortions in facial appearance owing to camera perspective and scale severely impede performance of traditional head pose classification methods. FEGA-MTL operates on a dense uniform spatial grid and learns appearance relationships across partitions as well as partition-specific appearance variations for a given head pose to build region-specific classifiers. Guided by two graphs which a-priori model appearance similarity among (i) grid partitions based on camera geometry and (ii) head pose classes, the learner efficiently clusters appearancewise related grid partitions to derive the optimal partitioning. For pose classification, upon determining the target's position using a person tracker, the appropriate regionspecific classifier is invoked. Experiments confirm that FEGA-MTL achieves state-of-the-art classification with few training data."}

We propose and investigate two baseline formulations, based on regression and domain adaptation.

We applied the proposed approach on two fine-grained categorization datasets, and the results indicate successful classifier prediction."}

A video is modeled using a collection of both global and segment-level features and kernel functions are employed for similarity comparisons. The locations of salient, discriminative video segments are treated as a latent variable, allowing the model to explicitly ignore portions of the video that are unimportant for classification. A novel, multiple kernel learning (MKL) latent support vector machine (SVM) is defined, that is used to combine and re-weight multiple feature types in a principled fashion while simultaneously operating within the latent variable framework. The compositional nature of the proposed model allows it to respond directly to the challenges of temporal clutter and intra-class variation, which are prevalent in unconstrained internet videos. Experimental results on the TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection 2011 (MED11) dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the method."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2013", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "On One-Shot Similarity Kernels", "Title": "Explicit Feature Maps and Properties", "Abstract": "Kernels have been a common tool of machine learning and computer vision applications for modeling nonlinearities and/or the design of robust 1 similarity measures between objects. Arguably, the class of positive semidefinite (psd) kernels, widely known as Mercerâ€™s Kernels,constitutes one of the most well-studied cases. For every psd kernel there exists an associated feature map to an arbitrary dimensional Hilbert space H, the so-called feature space. The main reason behind psd kernelsâ€™ popularity is the fact that classification/regression techniques (such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs)) and component analysis algorithms (such as Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA)) can be devised in H, without an explicit definition of the feature map, only by using the kernel (the so-called kernel trick). Recently, due to the development of very efficient solutions for large scale linear SVMs and for incremental linear component analysis, the research towards finding feature map approximations for classes of kernels has attracted significant interest. In this paper, we attempt the derivation of explicit feature maps of a recently proposed class of kernels, the so-called one-shot similarity kernels. We show that for this class of kernels either there exists an explicit representation in feature space or the kernel can be expressed in such a form that allows for exact incremental learning. We theoretically explore the properties of these kernels and show how these kernels can be used for the development of robust visual tracking, recognition and deformable fitting algorithms."}

Towards this goal, we propose a branch and bound algorithm which is guaranteed to retrieve the global optimum of the joint problem. The main difficulty resides in taking into account occlusion in order to not over-count the evidence. We introduce a new decomposition method, which generalizes integral geometry to triangular shapes, and allows us to bound the different terms in constant time. We exploit both geometric cues and object detectors as image features and show large improvements in 2D and 3D object detection over state-of-the-art deformable part-based models."}

By leveraging rich annotations associated with each image, our algorithm can automatically produce precise and detailed 3D models of a scene from a single image. Moreover, we can transfer information across images to accurately label and segment objects in a scene. The true benefit of 3DNN compared to a traditional 2D nearest-neighbor approach is that by generalizing across viewpoints, we free ourselves from the need to have training examples captured from all possible viewpoints. Thus, we are able to achieve comparable results using orders of magnitude less data, and recognize objects from never-beforeseen viewpoints. In this work, we describe the 3DNN algorithm and rigorously evaluate its performance for the tasks of geometry estimation and object detection/segmentation. By decoupling the viewpoint and the geometry of an image, we develop a scene matching approach which is truly 100% viewpoint invariant, yielding state-of-the-art performance on challenging data."}

The algorithm uses two components: a detector that makes use of the generalised Hough transform with pixel-based descriptors, and a probabilistic segmentation method based on global models for foreground and background. These components are used for tracking in a combined way, and they adapt each other in a co-training manner. Through effective model adaptation and segmentation, the algorithm is able to track objects that undergo rigid and non-rigid deformations and considerable shape and appearance variations. The proposed tracking method has been thoroughly evaluated on challenging standard videos, and outperforms state-of-theart tracking methods designed for the same task. Finally, the proposed models allow for an extremely efficient implementation, and thus tracking is very fast."}

In this paper, we propose to use a similar process in order to parse a scene. We model a scene as a collage of warped, layered objects sampled from labeled, reference images. Each object is related to the rest by a set of support constraints. Scene parsing is achieved through analysis-by-synthesis. Starting with a dataset of labeled exemplar scenes, we retrieve a dictionary of candidate object segments thatttriginal inlch imcchie e query ryEtem m-ige age.

We exploit this representation for several applications: image editing, random scene synthesis, and image-to-anaglyph."}

Our first contribution consists in using Shift-Invariant Sparse Coding (SISC) to learn mid-level elements that can translate during coding. This results in systematically better approximations than those attained using standard sparse coding. To emphasize that the learned mid-level structures are shiftable we call them shufflets. Our second contribution consists in using the resulting score to construct probabilistic upper bounds to the exact template scores, instead of taking them 'at face value' as is common in current works. We integrate shufflets in DualTree Branch-and-Bound and cascade-DPMs and demonstrate that we can achieve a substantial acceleration, with practically no loss in performance."}

In online subspace learning, the observations are an unknown mixture of two components presented to the model sequentially -the main effect which pertains to the subspace and a residual/error term. If no additional requirement is imposed on the residual, it often corresponds to noise terms in the signal which were unaccounted for by the main effect. To remedy this, one may impose 'structural' contiguity, which has the intended effect of leveraging the secondary terms as a covariate that helps the estimation of the subspace itself, instead of merely serving as a noise residual. We show that the corresponding online estimation procedure can be written as an approximate optimization process on a Grassmannian. We propose an efficient numerical solution, GOSUS, Grassmannian Online ficintnnumeriallsowith n,GGOSSUUS,GGrasssmaafor this problem. GOSUS is expressive enough in modeling both homogeneous perturbations of the subspace and structural contiguities of outliers, and after certain manipulations, solvable via an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

Biases like these can have downstream effects in the use of vision datasets in the construction of generalizable techniques, especially for the goal of the creation of a classification system capable of generalizing to unseen and novel datasets. In this work we propose Unbiased Metric Learning (UML), a metric learning approach, to achieve this goal. UML operates in the following two steps: (1) By varying hyperparameters, it learns a set of less biased candidate distance metrics on training examples from multiple biased datasets. The key idea is to learn a neighborhood for each example, which consists of not only examples of the same category from the same dataset, but those from other datasets. The learning framework is based on structural SVM. (2) We do model validation on a set of weakly-labeled web images retrieved by issuing class labels as keywords to search engine. The metric with best validation performance is selected. Although the web images sometimes have noisy labels, they often tend to be less biased, which makes them suitable for the validation set in our task. Cross-dataset image classification experiments are carried out. Results show significant performance improvement on four well-known computer vision datasets."}

Silhouettes, for instance, inherently entangle body shape and gait. For gait analysis and recognition, decoupling these two factors is desirable. Most important, once decoupled, they can be combined for the task at hand, but not if left entangled in the first place. In this paper, we introduce Two-Point Gait, a gait representation that encodes the limb motions regardless of the body shape. Two-Point Gait is directly computed on the image sequence based on the two point statistics of optical flow fields. We demonstrate its use for exploring the space of human gait and gait recognition under large clothing variation.

However, despite several major advances over the last decade, handling large displacement in optical flow remains an open problem. Inspired by the large displacement optical flow of Brox & Malik [6], our approach, termed DeepFlow, blends a matching algorithm with a variational approach for optical flow. We propose a descriptor matching algorithm, tailored to the optical flow problem, that allows to boost performance on fast motions. The matching algorithm builds upon a multi-stage architecture with 6 layers, interleaving convolutions and max-pooling, a construction akin to deep convolutional nets. Using dense sampling, it allows to efficiently retrieve quasi-dense correspondences, and enjoys a built-in smoothing effect on descriptors matches, a valuable asset for integration into an energy minimization framework for optical flow estimation. DeepFlow efficiently handles large displacements occurring in realistic videos, and shows competitive performance on optical flow benchmarks. Furthermore, it sets a new state-of-the-art on the MPI-Sintel dataset [8]."}

The proposed method uses motion dynamics as a cue to distinguish targets with similar appearance, minimize target mis-identification and recover missing data. Computational efficiency is achieved by using a Generalized Linear Assignment (GLA) coupled with efficient procedures to recover missing data and estimate the complexity of the underlying dynamics. The proposed approach works with tracklets of arbitrary length and does not assume a dynamical model a priori, yet it captures the overall motion dynamics of the targets. Experiments using challenging videos show that this framework can handle complex target motions, non-stationary cameras and long occlusions, on scenarios where appearance cues are not available or poor."}

In this paper we propose the SIFTpack: a compact way of storing SIFT descriptors, which enables significantly faster calculations between sets of SIFTs than the current solutions. SIFTpack can be used to represent SIFTs densely extracted from a single image or sparsely from multiple different images. We show that the SIFTpack representation saves both storage space and run time, for both finding nearest neighbors and for computing all distances between all descriptors.

The tools in this paper allow a human to put on 'HOG goggles' and perceive the visual world as a HOG based object detector sees it. We found that these visualizations allow us to analyze object detection systems in new ways and gain new insight into the detector's failures. For example, when we visualize the features for high scoring false alarms, we discovered that, although they are clearly wrong in image space, they do look deceptively similar to true positives in feature space. This result suggests that many of these false alarms are caused by our choice of feature space, and indicates that creating a better learning algorithm or building bigger datasets is unlikely to correct these errors. By visualizing feature spaces, we can gain a more intuitive understanding of our detection systems."}

Our framework, which we call tracking-byselection, is similar to tracking-by-detection in that it separates the tasks of detection and tracking, but it shifts temporal reasoning from the tracking stage to the detection stage. The core feature of tracking-by-selection is that it reasons about path hypotheses that traverse the entire video instead of a chain of single-frame object hypotheses. A traditional chain-shaped tracking-by-detection model is only able to promote consistency between one frame and the next. In tracking-by-selection, path hypotheses exist across time, and encouraging long-term temporal consistency is as simple as rewarding path hypotheses with consistent image features. One additional advantage of tracking-by-selection is that it results in a dramatically simplified model that can be solved exactly. We adapt an existing tracking-by-detection model to the tracking-by-selection framework, and show improved performance on a challenging dataset (introduced in [18])."}

Traditional approaches represent each video as a set of low level features and encode it into a fixed length feature vector (e.g. Bag-of-Words), which leave a big gap between low level visual features and high level events. Our paper tries to address this problem by exploiting activity concept transitions in video events (ACTIVE). A video is treated as a sequence of short clips, all of which are observations corresponding to latent activity concept variables in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We propose to apply Fisher Kernel techniques so that the concept transitions over time can be encoded into a compact and fixed length feature vector very efficiently. Our approach can utilize concept annotations from independent datasets, and works well even with a very small number of training samples. Experiments on the challenging NIST TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection (MED) dataset shows our approach performs favorably over the state-of-the-art."}

The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is one of the widely-used methods for solving the registration problem. Based on local iteration, ICP is however well-known to suffer from local minima. Its performance critically relies on the quality of initialization, and only local optimality is guaranteed. This paper provides the very first globally optimal solution to Euclidean registration of two 3D pointsets or two 3D surfaces under the L 2 error. Our method is built upon ICP, but combines it with a branch-and-bound (BnB) scheme which searches the 3D motion space SE(3) efficiently. By exploiting the special structure of the underlying geometry, we derive novel upper and lower bounds for the ICP error function. The integration of local ICP and global BnB enables the new method to run efficiently in practice, and its optimality is exactly guaranteed. We also discuss extensions, addressing the issue of outlier robustness."}

Many objects, such as clock towers with nearly identical sides, or domes with strong radial symmetries, pose challenges for structure from motion. When similar but distinct features are mistakenly equated, the resulting 3D reconstructions can have errors ranging from phantom walls and superimposed structures to a complete failure to reconstruct. We present a new approach to solving such problems by considering the local visibility structure of such repeated features. Drawing upon network theory, we present a new way of scoring features using a measure of local clustering. Our model leads to a simple, fast, and highly scalable technique for disambiguating repeated features based on an analysis of an underlying visibility graph, without relying on explicit geometric reasoning. We demonstrate our method on several very large datasets drawn from Internet photo collections, and compare it to a more traditional geometry-based disambiguation technique."}

In particular, a user's (possibly subconscious) search strategy leads him to comment on certain images rather than others, based on how any of the visible candidate images compare to the desired content. For example, he may be more likely to give negative feedback on an irrelevant image that is relatively close to his target, as opposed to bothering with one that is altogether different. We introduce novel features to capitalize on such implied feedback cues, and learn a ranking function that uses them to improve the system's relevance estimates. We validate the approach with real users searching for shoes, faces, or scenes using two different modes of feedback: binary relevance feedback and relative attributes-based feedback. The results show that retrieval improves significantly when the system accounts for the learned behaviors. We show that the nuances learned are domain-invariant, and useful for both generic user-independent search as well as personalized user-specific search."}

Motion estimation from image data is then studied on subspaces spanned by these bases. A reduced model is obtained as the Galerkin projection on these subspaces of a physical model, based on Euler and optical flow equations. A data assimilation method is studied, which assimilates coefficients of image data in the reduced model in order to estimate motion coefficients. The approach is first quantified on synthetic data: it demonstrates the interest of model reduction as a compromise between results quality and computational cost. Results obtained on real data are then displayed so as to illustrate the method."}

In this paper we strive to answer two key questions. First, where are we currently as a field: what have we done right, what still needs to be improved? Second, where should we be going in designing the next generation of object detectors? Inspired by the recent work of Hoiem et al. [10] on the standard PASCAL VOC detection dataset, we perform a large-scale study on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) data. First, we quantitatively demonstrate that this dataset provides many of the same detection challenges as the PASCAL VOC. Due to its scale of 1000 object categories, ILSVRC also provides an excellent testbed for understanding the performance of detectors as a function of several key properties of the object classes. We conduct a series of analyses looking at how different detection methods perform on a number of imagelevel and object-class-level properties such as texture, color, deformation, and clutter. We learn important lessons of the current object detection methods and propose a number of insights for designing the next generation object detectors."}

Among them, methods based on tree-based representations achieve good trade-off between accuracy and test time efficiency. While focusing on learning a tree-shaped hierarchy and the corresponding set of classifiers, most of them [11, 2, 14] use a greedy prediction algorithm for test time efficiency. We argue that the dramatic decrease in accuracy at high efficiency is caused by the specific design choice of the learning and greedy prediction algorithms. In this work, we propose a classifier which achieves a better trade-off between efficiency and accuracy with a given tree-shaped hierarchy. First, we convert the classification problem as finding the best path in the hierarchy, and a novel branchand-bound-like algorithm is introduced to efficiently search for the best path. Second, we jointly train the classifiers using a novel Structured SVM (SSVM) formulation with additional bound constraints. As a result, our method achieves a significant 4.65%, 5.43%, and 4.07% (relative 24.82%, 41.64%, and 109.79%) improvement in accuracy at high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art greedy \"tree-based\" methods [14] on Caltech-256 [15], SUN [32] and ImageNet 1K [9] dataset, respectively. Finally, we show that our branch-and-bound-like algorithm naturally ranks the paths in the hierarchy (Fig. 8) so that users can further process them."}

Consequently, there is little analysis of video segmentation which generalizes across subtasks, and it is not yet clear which and how video segmentation should leverage the information from the still-frames, as previously studied in image segmentation, alongside video specific information, such as temporal volume, motion and occlusion. In this work we provide such an analysis based on annotations of a large video dataset, where each video is manually segmented by multiple persons. Moreover, we introduce a new volume-based metric that includes the important aspect of temporal consistency, that can deal with segmentation hierarchies, and that reflects the tradeoff between over-segmentation and segmentation accuracy."}

We start from the template-based approach based on the LINE2D/LINEMOD representation introduced recently by Hinterstoisser et al., yet extend it in two ways. First, we propose to learn the templates in a discriminative fashion. We show that this can be done online during the collection of the example images, in just a few milliseconds, and has a big impact on the accuracy of the detector. Second, we propose a scheme based on cascades that speeds up detection. Since detection of an object is fast, new objects can be added with very low cost, making our approach scale well. In our experiments, we easily handle 10-30 3D objects at frame rates above 10fps using a single CPU core. We outperform the state-of-the-art both in terms of speed as well as in terms of accuracy, as validated on 3 different datasets. This holds both when using monocular color images (with LINE2D) and when using RGBD images (with LINEMOD). Moreover, we propose a challenging new dataset made of 12 objects, for future competing methods on monocular color images."}

In this paper we propose a fast, simple, yet powerful non-parametric Moving Pose (MP) framework for low-latency human action and activity recognition. Central to our methodology is a moving pose descriptor that considers both pose information as well as differential quantities (speed and acceleration) of the human body joints within a short time window around the current frame. The proposed descriptor is used in conjunction with a modified kNN classifier that considers both the temporal location of a particular frame within the action sequence as well as the discrimination power of its moving pose descriptor compared to other frames in the training set. The resulting method is non-parametric and enables low-latency recognition, one-shot learning, and action detection in difficult unsegmented sequences. Moreover, the framework is real-time, scalable, and outperforms more sophisticated approaches on challenging benchmarks like MSR-Action3D or MSR-DailyActivities3D."}

One of its most fundamental and essential problems is how to more effectively describe a sketch image. Many existing descriptors, such as shape context, have achieved great success. In this paper, we propose a new descriptor, namely Symmetric-aware Flip Invariant Sketch Histogram (SYM-FISH) to refine the shape context feature. Its extraction process includes three steps. First the Flip Invariant Sketch Histogram (FISH) descriptor is extracted on the input image, which is a flip-invariant version of the shape context feature. Then we explore the symmetry character of the image by calculating the kurtosis coefficient. Finally, the SYM-FISH is generated by constructing a symmetry table. The new SYM-FISH descriptor supplements the original shape context by encoding the symmetric information, which is a pervasive characteristic of natural scene and objects. We evaluate the efficacy of the novel descriptor in two applications, i.e., sketch retrieval and sketch classification. Extensive experiments on three datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed SYM-FISH descriptor."}

In this paper we explore sparse dictionary learning over the space of linear subspaces, which form Riemannian structures known as Grassmann manifolds. To this end, we propose to embed Grassmann manifolds into the space of symmetric matrices by an isometric mapping, which enables us to devise a closed-form solution for updating a Grassmann dictionary, atom by atom. Furthermore, to handle non-linearity in data, we propose a kernelised version of the dictionary learning algorithm. Experiments on several classification tasks (face recognition, action recognition, dynamic texture classification) show that the proposed approach achieves considerable improvements in discrimination accuracy, in comparison to state-of-the-art methods such as kernelised Affine Hull Method and graphembedding Grassmann discriminant analysis."}

In this paper, we tackle the challenge of recognizing and describing activities \"in-the-wild\". We present a solution that takes a short video clip and outputs a brief sentence that sums up the main activity in the video, such as the actor, the action and its object. Unlike previous work, our approach works on out-of-domain actions: it does not require training videos of the exact activity. If it cannot find an accurate prediction for a pre-trained model, it finds a less specific answer that is also plausible from a pragmatic standpoint. We use semantic hierarchies learned from the data to help to choose an appropriate level of generalization, and priors learned from web-scale natural language corpora to penalize unlikely combinations of actors/actions/objects; we also use a web-scale language model to \"fill in\" novel verbs, i.e. when the verb does not appear in the training set. We evaluate our method on a large YouTube corpus and demonstrate it is able to generate short sentence descriptions of video clips better than baseline approaches."}

This is a fundamental task whose output may serve as the basis for further computer vision tasks like segmentation, resizing, tracking and so forth. In this paper we propose a novel salient region detection algorithm by integrating three important visual cues namely uniqueness, focusness and objectness (UFO). In particular, uniqueness captures the appearance-derived visual contrast; focusness reflects the fact that salient regions are often photographed in focus; and objectness helps keep completeness of detected salient regions. While uniqueness has been used for saliency detection for long, it is new to integrate focusness and objectness for this purpose. In fact, focusness and objectness both provide important saliency information complementary of uniqueness. In our experiments using public benchmark datasets, we show that, even with a simple pixel level combination of the three components, the proposed approach yields significant improvement compared with previously reported methods."}

Our basic idea is to formulate the PnP problem into a functional minimization problem and retrieve all its stationary points by using the Gr??bner basis technique. The novelty lies in a non-unit quaternion representation to parameterize the rotation and a simple but elegant formulation of the PnP problem into an unconstrained optimization problem. Interestingly, the polynomial system arising from its first-order optimality condition assumes two-fold symmetry, a nice property that can be utilized to improve speed and numerical stability of a Gr??bner basis solver. Experiment results have demonstrated that, in terms of accuracy, our proposed solution is definitely better than the state-ofthe-art O(n) methods, and even comparable with the reprojection error minimization method."}

In this paper, we embed this principle in a novel image descriptor, dubbed Heterogeneous Auto-Similarities of Characteristics (HASC). HASC is applied to heterogeneous dense features maps, encoding linear relations by covariances and nonlinear associations through information-theoretic measures such as mutual information and entropy. In this way, highly complex structural information can be expressed in a compact, scale invariant and robust manner. The effectiveness of HASC is tested on many diverse detection and classification scenarios, considering objects, textures and pedestrians, on widely known benchmarks (Caltech-101, Brodatz, Daimler Multi-Cue). In all the cases, the results obtained with standard classifiers demonstrate the superiority of HASC with respect to the most adopted local feature descriptors nowadays, such as SIFT, HOG, LBP and feature covariances. In addition, HASC sets the state-of-the-art on the Brodatz texture dataset and the Daimler Multi-Cue pedestrian dataset, without exploiting ad-hoc sophisticated classifiers."}

Recently, the increasing popularity of depth sensors has made it possible to obtain reliable depth easily. This may be a game changer for tracking, since depth can be used to prevent model drift and handle occlusion. We also observe that current tracking algorithms are mostly evaluated on a very small number of videos collected and annotated by different groups. The lack of a reasonable size and consistently constructed benchmark has prevented a persuasive comparison among different algorithms. In this paper, we construct a unified benchmark dataset of 100 RGBD videos with high diversity, propose different kinds of RGBD tracking algorithms using 2D or 3D model, and present a quantitative comparison of various algorithms with RGB or RGBD input. We aim to lay the foundation for further research in both RGB and RGBD tracking, and our benchmark is available at http://tracking.cs.princeton.edu."}

When describing an image, people are likely to describe these dominant attributes first. Attribute dominance is a result of a complex interplay between the various properties present or absent in the image. Which attributes in an image are more dominant than others reveals rich information about the content of the image. In this paper we tap into this information by modeling attribute dominance.

Our solution is recursive, not in the size of input data but in the number of dimensions. One result is a clustering algorithm that is tuned to small codebooks but does not need all data in memory at the same time and is practically constant in the data size. As a by-product, a tree structure performs either exact or approximate quantization on trained centroids, the latter being not very precise but extremely fast. A lesser contribution is a new indexing scheme for image retrieval that exploits multiple small codebooks to provide an arbitrarily fine partition of the descriptor space. Large scale experiments on public datasets exhibit state of the art performance and remarkable generalization."}

Unlike previous action-related work, the discovery of patch classifiers is posed as a strongly-supervised process. Specifically, keypoint labels (e.g., position) across spacetime are used in a data-driven training process to discover patches that are highly clustered in the spacetime keypoint configuration space. To support this process, a new human action dataset consisting of challenging consumer videos is introduced, where notably the action label, the 2D position of a set of keypoints and their visibilities are provided for each video frame. On a novel input video, each acteme is used in a sliding volume scheme to yield a set of sparse, non-overlapping detections. These detecsseddeetecctions provide the intermediate substrate for segmeegmenatot the action. For action classification, the proposed representation shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art low-level features, while providing spatiotemporal localization as additional output. This output sheds further light into detailed action understanding."}

This makes it challenging to learn detectors based on an object-level label (e.g., \"car\"). We postulate that having a richer set of labelings (at different levels of granularity) for an object, including finer-grained subcategories, consistent in appearance and view, and higherorder composites contextual groupings of objects consistent in their spatial layout and appearance, can significantly alleviate these problems. However, obtaining such a rich set of annotations, including annotation of an exponentially growing set of object groupings, is simply not feasible. We propose a weakly-supervised framework for object detection where we discover subcategories and the composites automatically with only traditional object-level category labels as input. To this end, we first propose an exemplar-SVM-based clustering approach, with latent SVM refinement, that discovers a variable length set of discriminative subcategories for each object class. We then develop a structured model for object detection that captures interactions among object subcategories and automatically discovers semantically meaningful and discriminatively relevant visual composites. We show that this model produces state-of-the-art performance on UIUC phrase object detection benchmark."}

Since a pool of natural images provides a nearly endless supply of negative samples, in the form of patches at different scales and locations, training with all the available data is considered impractical. A staple of current approaches is hard negative mining, a method of selecting relevant samples, which is nevertheless expensive. Given that samples at slightly different locations have overlapping support, there seems to be an enormous amount of duplicated work. It is natural, then, to ask whether these redundancies can be eliminated. In this paper, we show that the Gram matrix describing such data is block-circulant. We derive a transformation based on the Fourier transform that block-diagonalizes the Gram matrix, at once eliminating redundancies and partitioning the learning problem. This decomposition is valid for any dense features and several learning algorithms, and takes full advantage of modern parallel architectures. Surprisingly, it allows training with all the potential samples in sets of thousands of images. By considering the full set, we generate in a single shot the optimal solution, which is usually obtained only after several rounds of hard negative mining. We report speed gains on Caltech Pedestrians and INRIA Pedestrians of over an order of magnitude, allowing training on a desktop computer in a couple of minutes."}

Surface and background appearance models are learned online, leading to robust tracking in the presence of heavy occlusion and outliers. In both our tracking and reconstruction modules, the 3D object is implicitly embedded using a 3D level-set function. The framework is initialized with a simple shape primitive model (e.g. a sphere or a cube), and the real 3D object shape is tracked and reconstructed online. Unlike existing depth-based 3D reconstruction works, which either rely on calibrated/fixed camera set up or use the observed world map to track the depth camera, our framework can simultaneously track and reconstruct small moving objects. We use both qualitative and quantitative results to demonstrate the superior performance of both tracking and reconstruction of our method."}

To this end, we first introduce a generic deformation model, called Canonical Distortion Coefficients (CDCs), by characterizing the deformation of every point on a surface using the distortions along its two principle directions. This model subsumes the deformation groups commonly used in surface registration such as isometry and conformality, and is able to handle more complex deformations. We also derive its discrete counterpart which can be computed very efficiently in a closed form. Based on these, we introduce a higher-order Markov Random Field (MRF) model which seamlessly integrates our deformation model and a geometry/texture similarity metric. Then we jointly establish the optimal correspondences for all the points via maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Moreover, we develop a parallel optimization algorithm to efficiently perform the inference for the proposed higher-order MRF model. The resulting registration algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both dense non-rigid 3D surface registration and tracking."}

In many computer vision tasks, however, we need to measure the point-to-set distance (PSD) and even set-to-set distance (SSD) for classification. In this paper, we extend the PPD based Mahalanobis distance metric learning to PSD and SSD based ones, namely point-to-set distance metric learning (PSDML) and set-to-set distance metric learning (SSDML), and solve them under a unified optimization framework. First, we generate positive and negative sample pairs by computing the PSD and SSD between training samples. Then, we characterize each sample pair by its covariance matrix, and propose a covariance kernel based discriminative function. Finally, we tackle the PSDML and SSDML problems by using standard support vector machine solvers, making the metric learning very efficient for multiclass visual classification tasks. Experiments on gender classification, digit recognition, object categorization and face recognition show that the proposed metric learning methods can effectively enhance the performance of PSD and SSD based classification."}

Attributes have proven useful for object recognition, image search, face verification, image description, and zero-shot learning. Typically, attributes are either binary or relative: they describe either the presence or absence of a descriptive characteristic, or the relative magnitude of the characteristic when comparing two exemplars. However, prior work fails to model the actual way in which humans use these attributes in descriptive statements of images. Specifically, it does not address the important interactions between the binary and relative aspects of an attribute. In this work we propose a spoken attribute classifier which models a more natural way of using an attribute in a description. For each attribute we train a classifier which captures the specific way this attribute should be used. We show that as a result of using this model, we produce descriptions about images of people that are more natural and specific than past systems."}

The tasks that go into constructing such a dataset are difficult in isolation hand-labeling videos is painstaking, and structure from motion (SfM) is unreliable for large spaces. But if we combine them together, we make the dataset construction task much easier. First, we introduce an intuitive labeling tool that uses a partial reconstruction to propagate labels from one frame to another. Then we use the object labels to fix errors in the reconstruction. For this, we introduce a generalization of bundle adjustment that incorporates object-to-object correspondences. This algorithm works by constraining points for the same object from different frames to lie inside a fixed-size bounding box, parameterized by its rotation and translation. The SUN3D database, the source code for the generalized bundle adjustment, and the web-based 3D annotation tool are all available at http://sun3d.cs.princeton.edu."}

The use of multiple queries allows for a more expressive formulation of the query object including, e.g., different viewpoints and/or viewing conditions. This, in turn, leads to more diverse and more accurate retrieval results. When no query images are available to the user, they can easily be retrieved from the internet using a standard image search engine. In particular, we propose a new method based on pattern mining. Using the minimal description length principle, we derive the most suitable set of patterns to describe the query object, with patterns corresponding to local feature configurations. This results in a powerful object-specific mid-level image representation. The archive can then be searched efficiently for similar images based on this representation, using a combination of two inverted file systems. Since the patterns already encode local spatial information, good results on several standard image retrieval datasets are obtained even without costly re-ranking based on geometric verification."}

Existing re-identification studies focus on improving the ranking performance, but rarely look into the critical problem of optimising the time-consuming and error-prone post-rank visual search at the user end. In this study, we present a novel one-shot Post-rank OPtimisation (POP) method, which allows a user to quickly refine their search by either \"one-shot\" or a couple of sparse negative selections during a re-identification process. We conduct systematic behavioural studies to understand user's searching behaviour and show that the proposed method allows correct re-identification to converge 2.6 times faster than the conventional exhaustive search. Importantly, through extensive evaluations we demonstrate that the method is capable of achieving significant improvement over the stateof-the-art distance metric learning based ranking models, even with just \"one shot\" feedback optimisation, by as much as over 30% performance improvement for rank 1 reidentification on the VIPeR and i-LIDS datasets."}

Our particular focus is reliable text extraction from smartphone imagery, with the goal of text recognition as a user input modality similar to speech recognition. Commercially available OCR performs poorly on this task. Recent progress in machine learning has substantially improved isolated character classification; we build on this progress by demonstrating a complete OCR system using these techniques. We also incorporate modern datacenter-scale distributed language modelling. Our approach is capable of recognizing text in a variety of challenging imaging conditions where traditional OCR systems fail, notably in the presence of substantial blur, low resolution, low contrast, high image noise and other distortions. It also operates with low latency; mean processing time is 600 ms per image. We evaluate our system on public benchmark datasets for text extraction and outperform all previously reported results, more than halving the error rate on multiple benchmarks. The system is currently in use in many applications at Google, and is available as a user input modality in Google Translate for Android."}

This paper presents a model-based dimensionality reduction method for vector sequences, namely linear sequence discriminant analysis (LSDA) , which attempts to find a subspace in which sequences of the same class are projected together while those of different classes are projected as far as possible. For each sequence class, an HMM is built from states of which statistics are extracted. Means of these states are linked in order to form a mean sequence, and the variance of the sequence class is defined as the sum of all variances of component states. LSDA then learns a transformation by maximizing the separability between sequence classes and at the same time minimizing the within-sequence class scatter. DTW distance between mean sequences is used to measure the separability between sequence classes. We show that the optimization problem can be approximately transformed into an eigen decomposition problem. LDA can be seen as a special case of LSDA by considering non-sequential vectors as sequences of length one. The effectiveness of the proposed LSDA is demonstrated on two individual sequence datasets from UCI machine learning repository as well as two concatenate sequence datasets: APTI Arabic printed text database and IFN/ENIT Arabic handwriting database."}

By combining latest advances in image representation and natural language processing, we propose Neural-Image-QA, an end-to-end formulation to this problem for which all parts are trained jointly. In contrast to previous efforts, we are facing a multi-modal problem where the language output (answer) is conditioned on visual and natural language input (image and question). Our approach Neural-Image-QA doubles the performance of the previous best approach on this problem. We provide additional insights into the problem by analyzing how much information is contained only in the language part for which we provide a new human baseline. To study human consensus, which is related to the ambiguities inherent in this challenging task, we propose two novel metrics and collect additional answers which extends the original DAQUAR dataset to DAQUAR-Consensus."}

This paper aims to align books to their movie releases in order to provide rich descriptive explanations for visual content that go semantically far beyond the captions available in the current datasets. To align movies and books we propose a neural sentence embedding that is trained in an unsupervised way from a large corpus of books, as well as a video-text neural embedding for computing similarities between movie clips and sentences in the book. We propose a context-aware CNN to combine information from multiple sources. We demonstrate good quantitative performance for movie/book alignment and show several qualitative examples that showcase the diversity of tasks our model can be used for."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2015", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "RIDE", "Title": "Reversal Invariant Descriptor Enhancement", "Abstract": "In many fine-grained object recognition datasets, image orientation (left/right) might vary from sample to sample. Since handcrafted descriptors such as SIFT are not reversal invariant, the stability of image representation based on them is consequently limited. A popular solution is to augment the datasets by adding a left-right reversed copy for each original image. This strategy improves recognition accuracy to some extent, but also brings the price of almost doubled time and memory consumptions.  In this paper, we present RIDE (Reversal Invariant Descriptor Enhancement) for fine-grained object recognition. RIDE is a generalized algorithm which cancels out the impact of image reversal by estimating the orientation of local descriptors, and guarantees to produce the identical representation for an image and its left-right reversed copy. Experimental results reveal the consistent accuracy gain of RIDE with various types of descriptors. We also provide insightful discussions on the working mechanism of RIDE and its generalization to other applications."}

Unlike all existing visual feature extraction techniques which solely extracts features from video sequences, our method is able to explore both acoustic information and visual information to learn a better visual feature representation in the training stage. During the test stage, instead of using both audio and visual signals, only the videos are used for generating the missing audio feature, and both the given visual and given audio features are used to obtain a joint representation. We carried out our experiments on a large scale audio-visual data corpus, and experimental results show that our proposed techniques outperforms the performance of the hadncrafted features and features learned by other commonly used deep learning techniques."}

Conventional saliency models typically rely on low-level image statistics to predict human fixations. While these models perform significantly better than chance, there is still a large gap between model prediction and human behavior. This gap is largely due to the limited capability of models in predicting eye fixations with strong semantic content, the so-called semantic gap. This paper presents a focused study to narrow the semantic gap with an architecture based on Deep Neural Network (DNN). It leverages the representational power of high-level semantics encoded in DNNs pretrained for object recognition. Two key components are fine-tuning the DNNs fully convolutionally with an objective function based on the saliency evaluation metrics, and integrating information at different image scales. We compare our method with 14 saliency models on 6 public eye tracking benchmark datasets. Results demonstrate that our DNNs can automatically learn features particularly for saliency prediction that surpass by a big margin the state-of-the-art. In addition, our model ranks top to date under all seven metrics on the MIT300 challenge set."}

Many existing datasets contain images of scenes with a color chart included; however, only the chart's neutral colors (grayscale patches) are used to provide the ground truth for illumination estimation and correction.  This is because the corrected neutral colors are known to lie along the achromatic line in the camera's color space (i.e. R=G=B) ; the correct RGB values of the other color patches are not known.  As a result, most methods estimate a 3*3 diagonal matrix that ensures only the neutral colors are correct.  In this paper, we describe how to overcome this limitation.   Specifically, we show that under certain illuminations, a diagonal 3*3 matrix is capable of correcting not only neutral colors, but all the colors in a scene.   This finding allows us to find the ground truth RGB values for the color chart in the camera's color space. We show how to use this information to correct all the images in existing datasets to have correct colors.  Working from these new color corrected datasets, we describe how to modify existing color constancy algorithms to perform better image correction."}

In our SGF, we use the tree distance on the segment graph to define the internal weight function of the filtering kernel, which enables the filter to smooth out high-contrast details and textures while preserving major image structures very well. While for the external weight function, we introduce a user specified smoothing window to balance the smoothing effects from each node of the segment graph. Moreover, we also set a threshold to adjust the edge-preserving performance. These advantages make the SGF more flexible in various applications and overcome the \"halo\" and \"leak\" problems appearing in most of the state-of-the-art approaches. Finally and importantly, we develop a linear algorithm for the implementation of our SGF, which has an O(N) time complexity for both gray-scale and high dimensional images, regardless of the kernel size and the intensity range. Typically, as one of the fastest edge-preserving filters, our CPU implementation achieves 0.15s per megapixel when performing filtering for 3-channel color images. The strength of the proposed filter is demonstrated by various applications, including stereo matching, optical flow, joint depth map upsampling, edge-preserving smoothing, edges detection, image abstraction and texture editing."}

To address such an issue, this paper proposes a novel hierarchy-associated feature construction framework for salient object detection, which is based on integrating elementary features from multi-level regions in a hierarchy. Furthermore, multi-layered deep learning features are introduced and incorporated as elementary features into this framework through a compact integration scheme. This leads to a rich feature representation, which is able to represent the context of the whole object/background and is much more discriminative as well as robust for salient object detection. Extensive experiments on the most widely used and challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art on salient object detection."}

The former is conceptually simple yet heuristic; while the latter is constrained by the fundamental limit of frequency aliasing. In this paper, we propose to develop a hybrid approach toward SR by combining those two lines of ideas. More specifically, the parameters underlying sparse distributions of desirable HR image patches are learned from a pair of LR image and retrieved HR images. Our hybrid approach can be interpreted as the first attempt of reconciling the difference between parametric and nonparametric models for low-level vision tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid SR method performs much better than existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both subjective and objective image qualities."}

However, perception studies suggest that humans employ object-level reasoning when judging if a particular pixel is a boundary. Inspired by this observation, in this work we show how to predict boundaries by exploiting object-level features from a pretrained object-classification network. Our method can be viewed as a \"High-for-Low\" approach where high-level object features inform the low-level boundary detection process. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on an established boundary detection benchmark and it is efficient to run.  Additionally, we show that due to the semantic nature of our boundaries we can use them to aid a number of high-level vision tasks. We demonstrate that using our boundaries we improve the performance of state-of-the-art methods on the problems of semantic boundary labeling, semantic segmentation and object proposal generation. We can view this process as a \"Low-for-High'\" scheme, where low-level boundaries aid high-level vision tasks.   Thus, our contributions include a boundary detection system that is accurate, efficient, generalizes well to multiple datasets, and is also shown to improve existing state-of-the-art high-level vision methods on three distinct tasks."}

Compared to the state of the art aimed at the same goal, our algorithm holds important attributes such as high robustness against holes and occlusion, low computational cost of both learning and tracking stages, and low memory consumption. These are obtained (a) by a novel formulation of the learning strategy, based on a dense sampling of the camera viewpoints and learning independent trees from a single image for each camera view; as well as, (b) by an insightful occlusion handling strategy that enforces the forest to recognize the object's local and global structures. Due to these attributes, we report state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on benchmark datasets, and accomplish remarkable scalability with the number of targets, being able to simultaneously track the pose of over a hundred objects at 30 fps with an off-the-shelf CPU. In addition, the fast learning time enables us to extend our algorithm as a robust online tracker for model-free 3D objects under different viewpoints and appearance changes as demonstrated by the experiments."}

In this paper we introduce a novel approach to reason about liquid containability - the affordance of containing liquid. Our approach analyzes container objects based on two simple physical processes: the Fill and Transfer of liquid. First, it reasons about whether a given 3D object is a liquid container and its best filling direction. Second, it proposes directions to transfer its contained liquid to the outside while avoiding spillage. We compare our simplified model with a common fluid dynamics simulation and demonstrate that our algorithm makes human-like choices about the best directions to fill containers and transfer liquid from them. We apply our approach to reason about the containability of several real-world objects acquired using a consumer-grade depth camera."}

While robust and even real-time solutions exist to this problem  if the observed scene is static, for non-rigid dense shape capture current systems are typically restricted to the use of complex multi-camera rigs, take advantage of the additional depth channel available in RGB-D cameras, or deal with specific shapes such as faces or planar surfaces. In contrast, our method makes use of a single RGB video as input; it can capture the deformations of generic shapes; and the depth estimation is dense, per-pixel and direct.  We first compute a dense 3D template of the shape of the object, using a short rigid sequence, and subsequently perform online reconstruction of the non-rigid mesh as it evolves over time.  Our energy optimization approach minimizes a robust photometric cost that simultaneously  estimates the temporal correspondences and 3D deformations with respect to the template mesh. In our experimental evaluation we show a range of qualitative results on novel datasets; we compare against an existing method that requires multi-frame optical flow; and perform a quantitative evaluation against other template-based approaches on a ground truth dataset."}

Inspired by these observations, we propose a computational model for weakly-supervised object detection, based on prior knowledge modelling, exemplar learning and learning with video contexts. The prior knowledge is modeled with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). When very few instances of a new concept are given, an initial concept detector is built by exemplar learning over the deep features the pre-trained CNN. The well-designed tracking solution is then used to discover more diverse instances from the massive online weakly labeled videos. Once a positive instance is detected/identified with high score in each video, more instances possibly from different view-angles and/or different distances are tracked and accumulated.  Then the concept detector can be fine-tuned based on these new instances. This process can be repeated again and again till we obtain a very mature concept detector. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC-07/10/12 object detection datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. It can beat the state-of-the-art full-training based performances by learning from very few samples for each object category, along with about 20,000 weakly labeled videos."}

First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures.

Generally, current datasets: 1) are limited in scale; 2) consist of hand-drawn bboxes, which are unavailable under realistic settings; 3) have only one ground truth and one query image for each identity (close environment). To tackle these problems, the proposed Market-1501 dataset is featured in three aspects. First, it contains over 32,000 annotated bboxes, plus a distractor set of over 500K images, making it the largest person re-id dataset to date. Second, images in Market-1501 dataset are produced using the Deformable Part Model (DPM) as pedestrian detector. Third, our dataset is collected in an open system, where each identity has multiple images under each camera.  As a minor contribution, inspired by recent advances in large-scale image search, this paper proposes an unsupervised Bag-of-Words descriptor. We view person re-identification as a special task of image search.

Motivated by the intuition that different modalities should contain not only some modal-specific patterns but also some shared common patterns, we propose a multi-modal feature learning framework for RGB-D object recognition. We first construct deep CNN layers for color and depth separately, and then connect them with our carefully designed multi-modal layers, which fuse color and depth information by enforcing a common part to be shared by features of different modalities. In this way, we obtain features reflecting shared properties as well as modal-specific properties in different modalities. The information of the multi-modal learning frameworks is back-propagated to the early CNN layers. Experimental results show that our proposed multi-modal feature learning method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on two widely used RGB-D object benchmark datasets."}

Existing methods, however, assume that corresponding regions in two modalities have the same label. In this paper, we address the problem of data misalignment and label inconsistencies, e.g., due to moving objects, in semantic labeling, which violate the assumption of existing techniques. To this end, we formulate multimodal semantic labeling as inference in a CRF, and introduce latent nodes to explicitly model inconsistencies between two domains. These latent nodes allow us not only to leverage information from both domains to improve their labeling, but also to cut the edges between inconsistent regions. To eliminate the need for hand tuning the parameters of our model, we propose to learn intra-domain and inter-domain potential functions from training data. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on two publicly available datasets containing 2D imagery and 3D point clouds. Thanks to our latent nodes and our learning strategy, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in both cases."}

Stroke-specific keypoints are efficiently detected and text fragments are subsequently extracted by local thresholding guided by keypoint properties. Classification based on effectively calculated features then eliminates non-text regions.  The stroke-specific keypoints produce 2 times less region segmentations and still detect 25% more characters than the commonly exploited MSER detector and the process is 4 times faster. After a novel efficient classification step, the number of regions is reduced to 7 times less than the standard method and is still almost 3 times faster.  All stages of the proposed pipeline are scale- and rotation-invariant and support a wide variety of scripts (Latin, Hebrew, Chinese, etc.) and fonts. When the proposed detector is plugged into a scene text localization and recognition pipeline, a state-of-the-art text localization accuracy is maintained  whilst the processing time is significantly reduced."}

Although text recognition and retrieval have received a lot of attention in recent years, previous works have focused on recognizing or retrieving exactly the same word used as a query, without taking the                                                                                   In this paper, we ask the following question: can we predict semantic concepts directly from a word image, without explicitly trying to transcribe the word image or its characters at any point? For this goal we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a weighted ranking loss objective that ensures that the concepts relevant to the query image are ranked ahead of those that are not relevant. This can also be interpreted as learning a Euclidean space where word images and concepts are jointly embedded. This model is learned in an end-to-end manner, from image pixels to semantic concepts, using a dataset of synthetically generated word images and concepts mined from a lexical database (WordNet).

We address this problem by proposing a novel holistic human body shape descriptor called BodyPrint. To compute the bodyprint for a given body scan, we fit a deformable human body mesh and project the mesh parameters to a low-dimensional subspace which improves discriminability across different persons. Experiments are carried out on three real-world human body datasets to demonstrate that BodyPrint is robust to pose variation as well as missing information and sensor noise. It improves the matching accuracy significantly compared to conventional 3D shape matching techniques using local features. To facilitate practical applications where the shape database may grow over time, we also extend our learning framework to handle online updates."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2015", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "The Middle Child Problem", "Title": "Revisiting Parametric Min-Cut and Seeds for Object Proposals", "Abstract": "Object proposals have recently fueled the progress in detection performance. These proposals aim to provide category-agnostic localizations for all objects in an image. One way to generate proposals is to perform parametric min-cuts over seed locations. This paper demonstrates that standard parametric-cut models are ineffective in obtaining medium-sized objects, which we refer to as the middle child problem. We propose a new energy minimization framework incorporating geodesic distances between segments which solves this problem. In addition, we introduce a new superpixel merging algorithm which can generate a small set of seeds that reliably cover a large number of objects of all sizes. We call our method POISE--- \"Proposals for Objects from Improved Seeds and Energies.\" POISE enables parametric min-cuts to reach their full potential. On PASCAL VOC it generates  2,640 segments with an average overlap of 0.81, whereas the closest competing methods require more than 4,200 proposals to reach the same accuracy. We show detailed quantitative comparisons against 5 state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL VOC and Microsoft COCO segmentation challenges."}

Such pixel-accurate supervision demands expensive labeling effort and limits the performance of deep networks that usually benefit from more training data. In this paper, we propose a method that achieves competitive accuracy but only requires easily obtained bounding box annotations. The basic idea is to iterate between automatically generating region proposals and training convolutional networks. These two steps gradually recover segmentation masks for improving the networks, and vise versa. Our method, called \"BoxSup\", produces competitive results (e.g., 62.0% mAP for validation) supervised by boxes only, on par with strong baselines (e.g., 63.8% mAP) fully supervised by masks under the same setting. By leveraging a large amount of bounding boxes, BoxSup further yields state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and PASCAL-CONTEXT."}

Thin shells are a physical model for surfaces with non-zero thickness whose deformation dissipates elastic energy. Thin shells, or their discrete counterparts, can be considered to reside in a shell space in which the notion of distance is given by the elastic energy required to deform one shape into another. It is in this setting that we show how to perform statistical analysis of a set of shapes (meshes in dense correspondence), providing a hybrid between physical and statistical shape modelling. The resulting models are better able to capture non-linear deformations, for example resulting from articulated motion, even when training data is very sparse compared to the dimensionality of the observation space."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2015", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "StereoSnakes", "Title": "Contour Based Consistent Object Extraction For Stereo Images", "Abstract": "Consistent object extraction plays an essential role for stereo image editing with the population of stereoscopic 3D media. Most previous methods perform segmentation on entire images for both views using dense stereo correspondence constraints. We find that for such kind of methods the computation is highly redundant since the two views are near-duplicate. Besides, the consistency may be violated due to the imperfectness of current stereo matching algorithms. In this paper, we propose a contour based method which searches for consistent object contours instead of regions. It integrates both stereo correspondence and object boundary constraints into an energy minimization framework. The proposed method has several advantages compared to previous works. First, the searching space is restricted in object boundaries thus the efficiency significantly improved. Second, the discriminative power of object contours results in a more consistent segmentation. Furthermore, the proposed method can effortlessly extend existing single-image segmentation methods to work in stereo scenarios. The experiment on the Adobe benchmark shows superior extraction accuracy and significant improvement of efficiency of our method to state-of-the-art. We also demonstrate in a few applications how our method can be used as a basic tool for stereo image editing."}

We observe that the standard likelihood term in these formulations corresponds to a generalized probabilistic K-means energy. In learning it is well known that this energy has a strong bias to clusters of equal size, which we express as a penalty for KL divergence from a uniform distribution of cardinalities. However, this volumetric bias has been mostly ignored in computer vision. We demonstrate significant artifacts in standard segmentation and reconstruction methods due to this bias. Moreover, we propose binary and multi-label optimization techniques that either (a) remove this bias or (b) replace it by a KL divergence term for any given target volume distribution. Our general ideas apply to continuous or discrete energy formulations in segmentation, stereo, and other reconstruction problems."}

The introduction of commodity depth sensors and a multitude of practical applications have spurred new advances. We provide an extensive analysis of the state-of-the-art, focusing on hand pose estimation from a single depth frame. To do so, we have implemented a considerable number of systems, and will release all software and evaluation code. We summarize important conclusions here: (1) Pose estimation appears roughly solved for scenes with isolated hands. However, methods still struggle to analyze cluttered scenes where hands may be interacting with nearby objects and surfaces. To spur further progress we introduce a challenging new dataset with diverse, cluttered scenes. (2) Many methods evaluate themselves with disparate criteria, making comparisons difficult. We define a consistent evaluation criteria, rigorously motivated by human experiments. (3) We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor baseline that outperforms most existing systems. This implies that most systems do not generalize beyond their training sets. This also reinforces the under-appreciated point that training data is as important as the model itself. We conclude with directions for future progress."}

A key challenge with deep learning methods is generating human-interpretable models. To address this, we propose a new technique that uses bubble images -- images where most of the content has been obscured -- to identify spatially localized, discriminative content in each image. By modifying the model training procedure to use both the source imagery and these bubble images, we can arrive at final models which retain much of the original classification performance, but are much more amenable to identifying interpretable visual elements. We apply our algorithm to a wide variety of datasets, including two new Internet-scale datasets of people and places, and show applications to visual mining and discovery. Our method is simple, scalable, and produces visual elements that are highly representative compared to prior work."}

In addition, although state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by previous inverted-indexing-based approaches, such methods do require manually designed parameter setting and much training, whereas our method is free from them. Therefore, PQTable offers a practical and useful solution for real-world problems."}

But existing work in hand detection has made strong assumptions that work well in only simple scenarios, such as with limited interaction with other people or in lab settings. We develop methods to locate and distinguish between hands in egocentric video using strong appearance models with Convolutional Neural Networks, and introduce a simple candidate region generation approach that outperforms existing techniques at a fraction of the computational cost. We show how these high-quality bounding boxes can be used to create accurate pixelwise hand regions, and as an application, we investigate the extent to which hand segmentation alone can distinguish between different activities.  We evaluate these techniques on a new dataset of 48 first-person videos (along with pixel-level ground truth for over 15,000 hand instances) of people interacting in realistic environments."}

The tree structure model is simple and convenient for exact inference, but short in modeling the occlusion coherence especially in the case of self-occlusion. We propose an occlusion aware graphical model which is able to model both self-occlusion and occlusion by the other objects simultaneously. The proposed model structure can encode the interactions between human body parts and objects, and hence enable it to learn occlusion coherence from data discriminatively. We evaluate our model on several public benchmarks for human pose estimation including challenging subsets featuring significant occlusion. The experimental results show that our method obtains comparable accuracy with the state-of-the-arts, and achieves promising performance in 2D human pose estimation with occlusion."}

However, most existing approaches heavily rely on human-curated training data, which hinders the scalability to large and unlabeled vocabularies in image tagging. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised deep learning model which can be trained from the readily available Web images to relax the dependence on human labors and scale up to arbitrary tags (categories). Specifically, based on the assumption that features of true samples in a category tend to be similar and noises tend to be variant, we embed the feature map of the last deep layer into a new affinity representation, and further minimize the discrepancy between the affinity representation and its low-rank approximation. The discrepancy is finally transformed into the objective function to give relevance feedback to back propagation. Experiments show that we can achieve a performance gain of 14.0% in terms of a semantic-based relevance metric in image tagging with 63,043 tags from the WordNet, against the typical deep model trained on the ImageNet 1,000 vocabulary set."}

Unlike existing stereo models which only output a disparity map, our model is able to output a 3D triangular mesh, which can be directly used for view interpolation. To this aim, we partition the input stereo images into 2D triangles with shared vertices. Lifting the 2D triangulation to 3D naturally generates a corresponding mesh. A technical difficulty is to properly split vertices to multiple copies when they appear at depth discontinuous boundaries. To deal with this problem, we formulate our objective as a two-layer MRF, with the upper layer modeling the splitting properties of the vertices and the lower layer optimizing a region-based stereo matching. Experiments on the Middlebury and the Herodion datasets demonstrate that our model is able to synthesize visually coherent new view angles with high PSNR, as well as outputting high quality disparity maps which rank at the first place on the new challenging high resolution Middlebury 3.0 benchmark."}

In this paper we propose a new solution answering these questions using a standard procedure devised by the safety community to validate complex systems: The Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP). It is designed to systematically search and identify difficult, performance-decreasing situations and aspects. We introduce a generic CV model that creates the basis for the hazard analysis and, for the first time, apply an extensive HAZOP to the CV domain. The result is a publicly available checklist with more than 900 identified individual hazards. This checklist can be used to evaluate existing test datasets by quantifying the amount of covered hazards. We evaluate our approach by first analyzing and annotating the popular stereo vision test datasets Middlebury and KITTI. Second, we compare the performance of six popular stereo matching algorithms at the identified hazards from our checklist with their average performance and show, as expected, a clear negative influence of the hazards. The presented approach is a useful tool to evaluate and improve test datasets and creates a common basis for future dataset designs."}

Prevalent benchmarks mainly use the root mean squared error (RMS) with respect to ground truth disparity maps to quantify algorithm performance.  We show that the RMS is of limited expressiveness for algorithm selection and introduce the HCI Stereo Metrics.  These metrics assess stereo results by harnessing three semantic cues: depth discontinuities, planar surfaces, and fine geometric structures. For each cue, we extract the relevant set of pixels from existing ground truth. We then apply our evaluation functions to quantify characteristics such as edge fattening and surface smoothness.  We demonstrate that our approach supports practitioners in selecting the most suitable algorithm for their application. Using the new Middlebury dataset, we show that rankings based on our metrics reveal specific algorithm strengths and weaknesses which are not quantified by existing metrics. We finally show how stacked bar charts and radar charts visually support multidimensional performance evaluation.

Yet, it is not always possible to fully reconstruct a scene. The images required to merge different sub-models might be missing or it might be impossible to acquire such images in the first place due to occlusions or the structure of the scene. The problem of aligning multiple reconstructions that do not have visual overlap is impossible to solve in general. An important variant of this problem is the case in which individual sides of a building can be reconstructed but not joined due to the missing visual overlap. In this paper, we present a combinatorial approach for solving this variant by automatically stitching multiple sides of a building together. Our approach exploits symmetries and semantic information to reason about the possible geometric relations between the individual  models. We show that our approach is able to reconstruct complete building models where traditional SfM ends up with disconnected building sides."}

Existing methods typically require either complete 3D volumetric observations, or a shape template. In this paper, we introduce a template-less 4D reconstruction method that incrementally fuses highly-incomplete 3D observations of a deforming object, and generates a complete, temporally-coherent shape representation of the object. To this end, we design an online algorithm that alternatively registers new observations to the current model estimate and updates the model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach at reconstructing non-rigidly moving objects from highly-incomplete measurements on both sequences of partial 3D point clouds and Kinect videos."}

However, the existing work is restricted to pairwise conditional random fields, which are insufficient when encoding rich scene context. In this work we propose models with higher-order potentials to describe complex relational information from the 3D scenes. Specifically, we relax the labelling problem to a regression, and generalize the higher-order associative P n Potts model to a new family of arbitrary higher-order models based on regression forests. We show that these models, like the robust P n models, can still be decomposed into the sum of pairwise terms by introducing auxiliary variables. Moreover, our proposed higher-order models also permit extension to hierarchical random fields, which allows for the integration of scene context and features computed at different scales. Our potential functions are constructed based on regression forests encoding Gaussian densities that admit efficient inference. The parameters of our model are learned from training data using a structured learning approach. Results on two datasets show clear improvements over current state-of-the-art methods."}

We show how 3D curves can be used to refine camera position estimation in challenging low-texture scenes.  In contrast to previous work, we allow the curves to be partially observed in all images, meaning that for the first time, curve-based SfM can be demonstrated in realistic scenes.  The algorithm is based on bundle adjustment, so needs an initial estimate, but even a poor estimate from a few point correspondences can be substantially improved by including curves, suggesting that this method would benefit many existing systems."}

Given an image and a natural language question about the image, the task is to provide an accurate natural language answer. Mirroring real-world scenarios, such as helping the visually impaired, both the questions and answers are open-ended. Visual questions selectively target different areas of an image, including background details and underlying context. As a result, a system that succeeds at VQA typically needs a more detailed understanding of the image and complex reasoning than a system producing generic image captions. Moreover, VQA is amenable to automatic evaluation, since many open-ended answers contain only a few words or a closed set of answers that can be provided in a multiple-choice format. We provide a dataset containing  0.25M images,  0.76M questions, and  10M answers (www.visualqa.org), and discuss the information it provides. Numerous baselines for VQA are provided and compared with human performance."}

Current image-based localization methods are based on either 2D-to-3D or 3D-to-2D to find the correspondences, which ignore the real scene geometric attributes. The main contribution of our paper is that we use a 3D model reconstructed by a short video as the query to realize 3D-to-3D localization under a multi-task point retrieval framework. Firstly, the use of a 3D model as the query enables us to efficiently select location candidates. Furthermore, the reconstruction of 3D model exploits the correlations among different images, based on the fact that images captured from different views for SfM share information through matching features. By exploring shared information (matching features) across multiple related tasks (images of the same scene captured from different views), the visual feature's view-invariance property can be improved in order to get to a higher point retrieval accuracy. More specifically, we use multi-task point retrieval framework to explore the relationship between descriptors and the 3D points, which extracts the discriminant points for more accurate 3D-to-3D correspondences retrieval. We further apply multi-task learning (MTL) retrieval approach on thermal images to prove that our MTL retrieval framework also provides superior performance for the thermal domain. This application is exceptionally helpful to cope with the localization problem in an environment with limited light sources."}

We argue for a data-driven, semantic approach for ranking object proposals. Our framework, which we call DeepBox, uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to rerank proposals from a bottom-up method.  We use a novel four-layer CNN architecture that is as good as much larger networks on the task of evaluating objectness while being much faster. We show that DeepBox significantly improves over the bottom-up ranking, achieving the same recall with 500 proposals as achieved by bottom-up methods with 2000. This improvement generalizes to categories the CNN has never seen before and leads to a 4.5-point gain in detection mAP.

{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2015", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "DeepProposal", "Title": "Hunting Objects by Cascading Deep Convolutional Layers", "Abstract": "In this paper we evaluate the quality of the activation layers of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the generation of object proposals. We generate hypotheses in a sliding-window fashion over different activation layers and show that the final convolutional layers can find the object of interest with high recall but poor localization due to the coarseness of the feature maps. Instead, the first layers of the network can better localize the object of interest but with a reduced recall. Based on this observation we design a method for proposing object locations that is based on CNN features and that combines the best of both worlds. We build an inverse cascade that, going from the final to the initial convolutional layers of the CNN, selects the most promising object locations and refines their boxes in a coarse-to-fine manner. The method is efficient, because i) it uses the same features extracted for detection, ii) it aggregates features using integral images, and iii) it avoids a dense evaluation of the proposals due to the inverse coarse-to-fine cascade. The method is also accurate; it outperforms most of the previously proposed object proposals approaches and when plugged into a CNN-based detector produces state-of-the-art detection performance."}

Recent works focus on descriptive phrases, such as \"a white dog\" to explain the visual composites of an input image. The phrases can not only express objects, attributes, events, and their relations but can also reduce visual complexity. A caption for an input image can be generated by connecting estimated phrases using a grammar model. However, because phrases are combinations of various words, the number of phrases is much larger than the number of single words. Consequently, the accuracy of phrase estimation suffers from too few training samples per phrase.  In this paper, we propose a novel phrase-learning method: Common Subspace for Model and Similarity (CoSMoS). In order to overcome the shortage of training samples, CoSMoS obtains a subspace in which (a) all feature vectors associated with the same phrase are mapped as mutually close, (b) classifiers for each phrase are learned, and (c) training samples are shared among co-occurring phrases.

However, two issues hinder its progress: scarcity of training data with viewpoint annotations, and a lack of powerful features. Inspired by the growing availability of 3D models, we propose a framework to address both issues by combining render-based image synthesis and CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks). We believe that 3D models have the potential in generating a large number of images of high variation, which can be well exploited by deep CNN with a high learning capacity. Towards this goal, we propose a scalable and overfit-resistant image synthesis pipeline, together with a novel CNN specifically tailored for the viewpoint estimation task. Experimentally, we show that the viewpoint estimation from our pipeline can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL 3D+ benchmark."}

Our WSL method encompasses three main contributions. Firstly, we introduce a new structured output latent variable model, Minimum mAximum lateNt sTRucturAl SVM (MANTRA), which prediction relies on a pair of latent variables: h^+ (resp. h^-) provides positive (resp. negative) evidence for a given output y. Secondly, we instantiate MANTRA for two different visual recognition tasks: multi-class classification and ranking. For ranking, we propose efficient solutions to exactly solve the inference and the loss-augmented problems. Finally, extensive experiments highlight the relevance of the proposed method: MANTRA outperforms state-of-the art results on five different datasets."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2015", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "DeepDriving", "Title": "Learning Affordance for Direct Perception in Autonomous Driving", "Abstract": "Today, there are two major paradigms for vision-based autonomous driving systems: mediated perception approaches that parse an entire scene to make a driving decision, and behavior reflex approaches that directly map an input image to a driving action by a regressor. In this paper, we propose a third paradigm: a direct perception approach to estimate the affordance for driving. We propose to map an input image to a small number of key perception indicators that directly relate to the affordance of a road/traffic state for driving. Our representation provides a set of compact yet complete descriptions of the scene to enable a simple controller to drive autonomously. Falling in between the two extremes of mediated perception and behavior reflex, we argue that our direct perception representation provides the right level of abstraction. To demonstrate this, we train a deep Convolutional Neural Network using recording from 12 hours of human driving in a video game and show that our model can work well to drive a car in a very diverse set of virtual environments. We also train a model for car distance estimation on the KITTI dataset. Results show that our direct perception approach can generalize well to real driving images. Source code and data are available on our project website."}

In this work we make a first contribution to answer this question in the context of image classification.  We frame this quest as an active learning problem and use zero-shot  classifiers to guide the learning process by linking the new task to the the  existing classifiers. By revisiting the dual formulation of adaptive SVM, we reveal two basic conditions to choose greedily only the most relevant samples to be annotated.  On this basis we propose an effective active learning algorithm which learns the best possible target classification model with minimum human labeling effort.  Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets show the value of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art active learning methodologies, as well as its potential to reuse past datasets with minimal effort for future tasks."}

Such difficult categories demand more dedicated classifiers. However, existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are trained as flat N-way classifiers, and few efforts have been made to leverage the hierarchical structure of categories. In this paper, we introduce hierarchical deep CNNs (HD-CNNs) by embedding deep CNNs into a category hierarchy. An HD-CNN separates easy classes using a coarse category classifier while distinguishing difficult classes using fine category classifiers. During HD-CNN training, component-wise pretraining is followed by global finetuning with a multinomial logistic loss regularized by a coarse category consistency term. In addition, conditional executions of fine category classifiers  and layer parameter compression make HD-CNNs scalable for large-scale visual recognition. We achieve state-of-the-art results on both CIFAR100 and large-scale ImageNet 1000-class benchmark datasets. In our experiments, we build up three different HD-CNNs and they lower the top-1 error of the standard CNNs by 2.65%, 3.1% and 1.1%, respectively"}

We propose and compare two architectures: a generic architecture and another one including a layer that correlates feature vectors at different image locations. Since existing ground truth data sets are not sufficiently large to train a CNN, we generate a large synthetic Flying Chairs dataset. We show that networks trained on this unrealistic data still generalize very well to existing datasets such as Sintel and KITTI, achieving competitive accuracy at frame rates of 5 to 10 fps."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2015", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Projection Bank", "Title": "From High-Dimensional Data to Medium-Length Binary Codes", "Abstract": "Recently, very high-dimensional feature representations, e.g., Fisher Vector, have achieved excellent performance for visual recognition and retrieval. However, these lengthy representations always cause extremely heavy computational and storage costs and even become unfeasible in some large-scale applications. A few existing techniques can transfer very high-dimensional data into binary codes, but they still require the reduced code length to be relatively long to maintain acceptable accuracies. To target a better balance between computational efficiency and accuracies, in this paper, we propose a novel embedding method called Binary Projection Bank (BPB), which can effectively reduce the very high-dimensional representations to medium-dimensional binary codes without sacrificing accuracies. Instead of using conventional single linear or bilinear projections, the proposed method learns a bank of small projections via the max-margin constraint to optimally preserve the intrinsic data similarity. We have systematically evaluated the proposed method on three datasets: Flickr 1M, ILSVR2010 and UCF101, showing competitive retrieval and recognition accuracies compared with state-of-the-art approaches, but with a significantly smaller memory footprint and lower coding complexity."}

Our system trains a convolutional neural network to regress the 6-DOF camera pose from a single RGB image in an end-to-end manner with no need of additional engineering or graph optimisation. The algorithm can operate indoors and outdoors in real time, taking 5ms per frame to compute. It obtains approximately 2m and 3 degrees accuracy for large scale outdoor scenes and 0.5m and 5 degrees accuracy indoors. This is achieved using an efficient 23 layer deep convnet, demonstrating that convnets can be used to solve complicated out of image plane regression problems. This was made possible by leveraging transfer learning from large scale classification data. We show that the PoseNet localizes from high level features and is robust to difficult lighting, motion blur and different camera intrinsics where point based SIFT registration fails. Furthermore we show how the pose feature that is produced generalizes to other scenes allowing us to regress pose with only a few dozen training examples."}

In this paper, we will briefly introduce the background of feedbacks in the human visual cortex, which motivates us to develop a computational feedback mechanism in the deep neural networks. The proposed networks perform inference from image features in a bottom-up manner as traditional convolutional networks; while during feedback loops it sets up high-level semantic labels as the agoala to infer the activation status of hidden layer neurons. The feedback networks help us better visualize and understand on how deep neural networks work as well as capture visual attention on expected objects, even in the images with cluttered background and multiple objects."}

Our strategy, which we term direct intrinsics, is to learn a convolutional neural network (CNN) that directly predicts output albedo and shading channels from an input RGB image patch.  Direct intrinsics is a departure from classical techniques for intrinsic image decomposition, which typically rely on physically-motivated priors and graph-based inference algorithms.  The large-scale synthetic ground-truth of the MPI Sintel dataset plays the key role in training direct intrinsics.  We demonstrate results on both the synthetic images of Sintel and the real images of the classic MIT intrinsic image dataset.  On Sintel, direct intrinsics, using only RGB input, outperforms all prior work, including methods that rely on RGB+Depth input.  Direct intrinsics also generalizes across modalities; our Sintel-trained CNN produces quite reasonable decompositions on the real images of the MIT dataset.  Our results indicate that the marriage of CNNs with synthetic training data may be a powerful new technique for tackling classic problems in computer vision."}

We first decompose the bounding box of a target object into multiple patches, which are described by color and gradient histograms. Then, we concatenate the features of the spatially ordered patches to represent the object appearance. Moreover, to alleviate the impacts of background information possibly included in the bounding box, we determine patch weights using random walk with restart (RWR) simulations. The patch weights represent the importance of each patch in the description of foreground information, and are used to construct an object descriptor, called spatially ordered and weighted patch (SOWP) descriptor. We incorporate the proposed SOWP descriptor into the structured output tracking framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art trackers on a recent benchmark dataset, and also excels in another recent benchmark dataset."}

They prepare vehicles for  unsafe road conditions and alert drivers if they perform a dangerous maneuver.  However, many accidents are unavoidable because by the time drivers are alerted, it is already too late.  Anticipating maneuvers beforehand can alert drivers before they perform the  maneuver and also give ADAS more time to avoid or prepare for the danger.  In this work we anticipate driving maneuvers a few seconds before they occur. For this purpose we equip a car with cameras and a computing device to capture the driving context from both inside and outside of the car. We propose an Autoregressive Input-Output HMM to model the contextual information alongwith the maneuvers. We evaluate our approach on a  diverse data set with 1180 miles of natural freeway and city driving and show that we can anticipate  maneuvers 3.5 seconds before they occur with over 80% F1-score in real-time."}

First, we extract discriminative patches in frames of videos. A video is represented based on these patches and divided into a collection of segments, each of which is regarded as a character typed in the search box. Then a partially observed video is considered as an activity prefix, consisting of one or more characters. Finally, the missing observation of an activity is predicted as the activity candidates provided by the auto-completion model. The candidates are matched against the activity prefix on-the-fly and ranked by a learning-to-rank algorithm. We validate our method on UT-Interaction Set #1 and Set #2 [19]. The experimental results show that the proposed activity auto-completion model achieves promising performance."}

The descriptor aggregates motion and appearance information along tracks of human body parts.

The received signal strength acts as a rough proxy for depth and a reliable cue on their identity. Although the measured signals are highly noisy (more than 2m average localization error), we demonstrate that the combination of visual and wireless data significantly improves the localization accuracy.   We introduce a novel image-driven representation of wireless data which embeds all received signals onto a single image. We then indicate the ability of this additional data to (i) locate persons within a sparsity-driven framework and to (ii) track individuals with a new confidence measure on the data association problem. Our solution outperforms existing localization methods by a significant margin. It can be applied to the millions of currently installed RGB cameras to better analyze human behavior and offer the next generation of high-accuracy location-based services."}

Typical approaches optimize an energy function over pose parameters using a `black box' image generation procedure. This procedure knows little about either the relationships between the parameters or the form of the energy function. In this paper, we show that we can significantly improving upon black box optimization by exploiting high-level knowledge of the structure of the parameters and using a local surrogate energy function. Our new framework, hierarchical sampling optimization, consists of a sequence of predictors organized into a kinematic hierarchy.  Each predictor is conditioned on its ancestors, and generates a set of samples over a subset of the pose parameters.  The highly-efficient surrogate energy is used to select among samples.  Having evaluated the full hierarchy, the partial pose samples are concatenated to generate a full-pose hypothesis.  Several hypotheses are generated using the same procedure, and finally the original full energy function selects the best result. Experimental evaluation on three publically available datasets show that our method is particularly impressive in low-compute scenarios where it significantly outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods."}

The core challenges in capturing social interactions are: (1) occlusion is functional and frequent; (2) subtle motion needs to be measured over a space large enough to host a social group; and (3) human appearance and configuration variation is immense. The Panoptic Studio is a system organized around the thesis that social interactions should be measured through the perceptual integration of a large variety of view points. We present a modularized system designed around this principle, consisting of integrated structural, hardware, and software innovations. The system takes, as input, 480 synchronized video streams of multiple people engaged in social activities, and produces, as output, the labeled time-varying 3D structure of anatomical landmarks on individuals in the space.

We collect a new dataset for this application containing  404,683 shop photos collected from 25 different online retailers and 20,357 street photos,  providing a total of  39,479 clothing item matches between street and shop photos.

We propose a framework to combine surface normals from polarization (hereafter polarization normals) with an aligned depth map. Polarization normals have not been used for depth enhancement before. This is because polarization normals suffer from physics-based artifacts, such as azimuthal ambiguity, refractive distortion and fronto-parallel signal degradation. We propose a framework to overcome these key challenges, allowing the benefits of polarization to be used to enhance depth maps.

However, because they borrow texture from their background and have a similar appearance to their surroundings, transparent objects are not handled well by regular image segmentation methods. We propose a method that overcomes these problems using the consistency and distortion properties of a light-field image. Graph-cut optimization is applied for the pixel labeling problem. The light-field linearity is used to estimate the likelihood of a pixel belonging to the transparent object or Lambertian background, and the occlusion detector is used to find the occlusion boundary.  We acquire a light field dataset for the transparent object, and use this dataset to evaluate our method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully segments transparent objects from the background."}

Our approach synergistically integrates the estimation of multiple intrinsic images including depth, albedo, shading, optical flow, and surface contours. We build upon an example-based framework for depth estimation that uses label transfer from a database of RGB and depth pairs. We combine this with a method that extracts consistent albedo and shading from video. In contrast to raw RGB values, albedo and shading provide a richer, more physical, foundation for depth transfer. Additionally we train a new contour detector to predict surface boundaries from albedo, shading, and pixel values and use this to improve the estimation of depth boundaries. We also integrate sparse structure from motion with our method to improve the metric accuracy of the estimated depth maps. We evaluate our Intrinsic Depth method quantitatively by estimating depth from videos in the NYU RGB-D and SUN3D datasets. We find that combining the estimation of multiple intrinsic images improves depth estimation relative to the baseline method."}

In this paper, we show that such correlational sensors can also be used to selectively accept or reject light rays from certain scene depths. The basic idea is to carefully select illumination and sensor modulation patterns such that the correlation is non-zero only in the selected depth range - thus light reflected from objects outside this depth range do not affect the correlational measurements. We demonstrate a prototype depth-selective camera and highlight two potential applications: imaging through scattering media and virtual blue screening. This depthselectivity can be used to reject back-scattering and reflection from media in front of the subjects of interest, thereby significantly enhancing the ability to image through scattering media- critical for applications such as car navigation in fog and rain. Similarly, such depth selectivity can also be utilized as a virtual blue-screen in cinematography by rejecting light reflecting from background, while selectively retaining light contributions from the foreground subject."}

Importantly, we consider finding faces from a new perspective through scoring facial parts responses by their spatial structure and arrangement. The scoring mechanism is carefully formulated considering challenging cases where faces are only partially visible. This consideration allows our network to detect faces under severe occlusion and unconstrained pose variation, which are the main difficulty and bottleneck of most existing face detection approaches.

In this paper, we study a fully automated system that can infer the perceived traits of a person from his face -- social dimensions, such as \"intelligence,\" \"honesty,\" and \"competence\" -- and how those traits can be used to predict the outcomes of real-world social events that involve long-term commitments, such as political elections, job hires, and marriage engagements. To this end, we propose a hierarchical model for enduring traits inferred from faces, incorporating high-level perceptions and intermediate-level attributes.  We show that our trained model can successfully classify the outcomes of two important political events, only using the photographs of politicians' faces. Firstly, it classifies the winners of a series of recent U.S. elections with the accuracy of 67.9% (Governors) and 65.5% (Senators). We also reveal that the different political offices require different types of preferred traits. Secondly, our model can categorize the political party affiliations of politicians, i.e., Democrats vs. Republicans, with the accuracy of 62.6% (male) and 60.1% (female). To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to use automated visual trait analysis to predict the outcomes of real-world social events. This approach is more scalable and objective than the prior behavioral studies, and opens for a range of new applications."}

Our starting point is the fact that some expressions, such as smiles, are very easily elicited, annotated, and automatically detected, while others are much harder to elicit and to annotate. We thus consider a novel problem:  all AU models for the target subject are to be learnt using person-specific annotated data for a reference AU (AU12 in our case), and no data or little data regarding the target AU. In order to design such a model, we propose a novel Multi-Task Learning and the associated Transfer Learning framework, in which we consider both relations across subjects and  AUs. That is to say, we consider a tensor structure among the tasks. Our approach hinges on learning the latent relations among tasks using one single reference AU, and then transferring these latent relations to other AUs. We show that we are able to effectively make use of the annotated data for AU12 when learning other person-specific AU models, even in the absence of data for the target task. Finally, we show the excellent performance of our method when small amounts of annotated data for the target tasks are made available."}

To this end, one natural demand is a supervised binary code learning method. While the learned codes might be discriminating, people often have a further expectation that whether some semantic message (e.g., visual attributes) can be read from the human-incomprehensible codes. For this purpose, we propose a novel binary code learning framework by jointly encoding identity discriminability and a number of facial attributes into unified binary code. In this way, the learned binary codes can be applied to not only fine-grained face image retrieval, but also facial attributes prediction, which is the very innovation of this work, just like killing two birds with one stone. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on a new purified large-scale web celebrity database, named CFW 60K, with abundant manual identity and attributes annotation, and experimental results exhibit the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art."}

Both generic and joint alignment approaches have been proposed with varying degrees of success. However, many generic methods are heavily sensitive to initializations and usually rely on offline-trained static models, which limit their performance on sequential images with extensive variations. On the other hand, joint methods are restricted to offline applications, since they require all frames to conduct batch alignment. To address these limitations, we propose to exploit incremental learning for personalized ensemble alignment. We sample multiple initial shapes to achieve image congealing within one frame, which enables us to incrementally conduct ensemble alignment by group-sparse regularized rank minimization. At the same time, personalized modeling is obtained by subspace adaptation under the same incremental framework, while correction strategy is used to alleviate model drifting. Experimental results on multiple controlled and in-the-wild databases demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared with state-of-the-arts in terms of fitting accuracy and efficiency."}

As an example, given sad and angry video takes of a scene, our method empowers the movie director to specify arbitrary weighted combinations and smooth transitions between the two takes in post-production. Our contributions include (1) a robust nonlinear audio-visual synchronization technique that exploits complementary properties of audio and visual cues to automatically determine robust, dense spatiotemporal correspondences between takes, and (2) a seamless facial blending approach that provides the director full control to interpolate timing, facial expression, and local appearance, in order to generate novel performances after filming. In contrast to most previous works, our approach operates entirely in image space, avoiding the need of 3D facial reconstruction. We demonstrate that our method can synthesize visually believable performances with applications in emotion transition, performance correction, and timing control."}

By studying statistical correlations between image sequences from outdoor cameras and temperature measurements we identify two interesting interactions. First, semantically meaningful regions such as foliage and reflective oriented surfaces are often highly indicative of the temperature. Second, small camera motions are correlated with the temperature in some scenes. We propose simple scene-specific temperature prediction algorithms which can be used to turn a camera into a crude temperature sensor. We find that for this task, simple features such as local pixel intensities outperform sophisticated, global features such as from a semantically-trained convolutional neural network."}

While computationally tractable discrete optimizers such as Graph Cuts and belief propagation (BP) exist for multi-label discrete problems, they still face prohibitively high computational challenges when the labels reside in a huge or very densely sampled space. Integrating key ideas from PatchMatch of effective particle propagation and resampling, PatchMatch belief propagation (PMBP) has been demonstrated to have good performance in addressing continuous labeling problems and runs orders of magnitude faster than Particle BP (PBP). However, the quality of the PMBP solution is tightly coupled with the local window size, over which the raw data cost is aggregated to mitigate ambiguity in the data constraint. This dependency heavily influences the overall complexity, increasing linearly with the window size. This paper proposes a novel algorithm called sped-up PMBP (SPM-BP) to tackle this critical computational bottleneck and speeds up PMBP by 50-100 times. The crux of SPM-BP is on unifying efficient filter-based cost aggregation and message passing with PatchMatch-based particle generation in a highly effective way. Though simple in its formulation, SPM-BP achieves superior performance for sub-pixel accurate stereo and optical-flow on benchmark datasets when compared with more complex and task-specific approaches."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2015", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Flow Fields", "Title": "Dense Correspondence Fields for Highly Accurate Large Displacement Optical Flow Estimation", "Abstract": "Modern large displacement optical flow algorithms usually use an initialization by either sparse descriptor matching techniques or dense approximate nearest neighbor fields. While the latter have the advantage of being dense, they have the major disadvantage of being very outlier prone as they are not designed to find the optical flow, but the visually most similar correspondence. In this paper we present a dense correspondence field approach that is much less outlier prone and thus much better suited for optical flow estimation than approximate nearest neighbor fields. Our approach is conceptually novel as it does not require explicit regularization, smoothing (like median filtering) or a new data term, but solely our novel purely data based search strategy that finds most inliers (even for small objects), while it effectively avoids finding outliers. Moreover, we present novel enhancements for outlier filtering. We show that our approach is better suited for large displacement optical flow estimation than state-of-the-art descriptor matching techniques. We do so by initializing EpicFlow (so far the best method on MPI-Sintel) with our Flow Fields instead of their originally used state-of-the-art descriptor matching technique. We significantly outperform the original EpicFlow on MPI-Sintel, KITTI and Middlebury."}

Here, we propose to go beyond these representations and model image-sets as probability distribution functions (PDFs) using kernel density estimators. To compare and match image-sets, we exploit Csiszar f-divergences, which bear strong connections to the geodesic distance defined on the space of PDFs, i.e., the statistical manifold. Furthermore, we introduce valid positive definite kernels on the statistical manifolds, which let us make use of more powerful classification schemes to match image-sets.  Finally, we introduce a supervised dimensionality reduction technique that learns a latent space where f-divergences reflect the class labels of the data. Our experiments on diverse problems, such as video-based face recognition and dynamic texture classification, evidence the benefits of our approach over the state-of-the-art image-set matching methods."}

The problem has received much attention recently, with renewed interest in variable-projection approaches, yielding dramatic improvements in reliability and speed. However, on a wide class of problems, no one approach dominates, and because the various approaches have been derived in a multitude of different ways, it has been difficult to unify them. This paper provides a unified derivation of a number of recent approaches, so that similarities and differences are easily observed. We also present a simple meta-algorithm which wraps any existing algorithm, yielding 100% success rate on many standard datasets. Given 100% success, the focus of evaluation must turn to speed, as 100% success is trivially achieved if we do not care about speed. Again our unification allows a number of generic improvements applicable to all members of the family to be isolated, yielding a unified algorithm that outperforms our re-implementation of existing algorithms, which in some cases already outperform the original authors' publicly available codes."}

To handle missing labels, we propose a unified model of label dependencies by constructing a mixed graph, which jointly incorporates (i) instance-level similarity and class co-occurrence as undirected edges and (ii) semantic label hierarchy as directed edges. Unlike most MLML methods, We formulate this learning problem transductively as a convex quadratic matrix optimization problem that encourages training label consistency and encodes both types of label dependencies (i.e. undirected and directed edges) using quadratic terms and hard linear constraints. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) can be used to exactly and efficiently solve this problem. To evaluate our proposed method, we consider two popular applications (image and video annotation), where the label hierarchy can be derived from Wordnet. Experimental results show that our method achieves a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods in performance and robustness to missing labels."}

Recently, high-order Boltzmann machine and its variants have exhibited the great power of modelling various data relation. However, most of them are unsupervised learning models which are not very discriminative and thus cannot server as a standalone solution to relation learning tasks. In this paper, we explore supervised learning algorithms and propose a new model named Conditional High-order Boltzmann Machine (CHBM), which can be directly used as a bilinear classifier to assign similarity scores for pairwise images. Then, to better deal with complex data relation, we propose a gated version of CHBM which untangles factors of variation by exploiting a set of latent variables to gate classification. We perform four-order tensor factorization for parameter reduction, and present two efficient supervised learning algorithms from the perspectives of being generative and discriminative, respectively. The experimental results of image transformation visualization, binary-way classification and face verification demonstrate that, by performing supervised learning, our models can greatly improve the performance."}

First is inertial sensors such as accelerometers. In order to estimate position and velocity, these sensors integrate the measured acceleration, which often results in accumulation of large errors over time. Second, camera-based approaches such as SLAM that can measure position directly, but their performance depends on the surrounding scene's properties. These approaches cannot function reliably if the scene has low frequency textures or small depth variations. We present a novel ego-motion sensor called SpeDo that addresses these fundamental limitations. SpeDo is based on using coherent light sources and cameras with large defocus. Coherent light, on interacting with a scene, creates a high frequency interferometric pattern in the captured images, called speckle. We develop a theoretical model for speckle flow (motion of speckle as a function of sensor motion), and show that it is quasi-invariant to surrounding scene's properties. As a result, SpeDo can measure ego-motion (not derivative of motion) simply by estimating optical flow at a few image locations. We have built a low-cost and compact hardware prototype of SpeDo and demonstrated high precision 6 DOF ego-motion estimation for complex trajectories in scenarios where the scene properties are challenging (e.g., repeating or no texture) as well as unknown."}

We propose to use cascaded regression with incremental learning to track generic objects without any prior knowledge of an object's structure or appearance. We exploit the spatial constraints between parts by implicitly learning the shape and deformation parameters of the object in an online fashion. We integrate a multiple temporal scale motion model to initialise our cascaded regression search close to the target and to allow it to cope with occlusions. Experimental results show that our tracker ranks first on the CVPR 2013 Benchmark."}

We formulate the contour flow estimation locally as a motion segmentation problem where motion patterns grouped from optical flow field are exploited for local correspondence measurement. To solve local ambiguities, contour flow estimation is further formulated globally as a contour alignment problem. We propose a novel two-staged strategy to obtain global consistent point correspondence under various contour transitions such as splitting, merging and branching. The goal of the first stage is to obtain possible accurate contour-to-contour alignments, and the second stage aims to make a consistent fusion of many partial alignments. Such a strategy can properly balance the accuracy and the consistency, which enables a middle-level motion representation to be constructed by just concatenating frame-by-frame contour flow estimation. Experiments prove the effectiveness of our method."}

Current  min-cost flow algorithms which solve the data association problem optimally have three main drawbacks: they are computationally expensive, they assume that the whole video is given as a batch, and they scale badly in memory and computation with the length of the video sequence. In this paper, we address each of these issues, resulting in a computationally and memory-bounded solution. First, we introduce a dynamic version of the successive shortest-path algorithm  which solves the data association problem optimally while reusing computation, resulting in  faster inference than standard solvers. Second, we address the optimal solution to the data association problem when dealing with an incoming stream of data (i.e., online setting). Finally, we present our main contribution which is an approximate online solution with bounded memory and computation which is capable of handling videos of arbitrary length while performing tracking in real time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on the KITTI and PETS2009 benchmarks and show state-of-the-art performance, while being significantly faster than existing solvers."}

In this paper, we propose the category-blind human recognition method (CHARM) which can recognize a human action without making assumptions of the action category. In our CHARM approach, we represent a human action (either a single-person action or a two-person interaction) class using a co-occurrence of motion primitives. Subsequently, we classify an action instance based on matching its motion primitive co-occurrence patterns to each class representation. The matching task is formulated as maximum clique problems. We conduct extensive evaluations of CHARM using three datasets for single-person actions, two-person interactions, and their mixtures. Experimental results show that CHARM performs favorably when compared with several state-of-the-art single-person action and two-person interaction based methods without making explicit assumptions of action category."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2015", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Beyond Covariance", "Title": "Feature Representation With Nonlinear Kernel Matrices", "Abstract": "Covariance matrix has recently received increasing attention in computer vision by leveraging Riemannian geometry of symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices. Originally proposed as a region descriptor, it has now been used as a generic representation in various recognition tasks. However, covariance matrix has shortcomings such as being prone to be singular, limited capability in modeling complicated feature relationship, and having a fixed form of representation. This paper argues that more appropriate SPD-matrix-based representations shall be explored to achieve better recognition. It proposes an open framework to use the kernel matrix over feature dimensions as a generic representation and discusses its properties and advantages. The proposed framework significantly elevates covariance representation to the unlimited opportunities provided by this new representation. Experimental study shows that this representation consistently outperforms its covariance counterpart on various visual recognition tasks. In particular, it achieves significant improvement on skeleton-based human action recognition, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance over both the covariance and the existing non-covariance representations."}

Different from traditional zero-shot approaches we do not demand the design and specification of attribute classifiers and class-to-attribute mappings to allow for transfer from seen classes to unseen classes. Our key contribution is objects2action, a semantic word embedding that is spanned by a skip-gram model of thousands of object categories. Action labels are assigned to an object encoding of unseen video based on a convex combination of action and object affinities. Our semantic embedding has three main characteristics to accommodate for the specifics of actions. First, we propose a mechanism to exploit multiple-word descriptions of actions and objects. Second, we incorporate the automated selection of the most responsive objects per action. And finally, we demonstrate how to extend our zero-shot approach to the spatio-temporal localization of actions in video. Experiments on four action datasets demonstrate the potential of our approach."}

We build on this intuition to improve multilabel image annotation. Our model uses image metadata nonparametrically to generate neighborhoods of related images using Jaccard similarities, then uses a deep neural network to blend visual information from the image and its neighbors. Prior work typically models image metadata parametrically; in contrast, our nonparametric treatment allows our model to perform well even when the vocabulary of metadata changes between training and testing. We perform comprehensive experiments on the NUS-WIDE dataset, where we show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for multilabel image annotation even when our model is forced to generalize to new types of metadata."}

However, errors occur and accumulate throughout each of these sequential steps which often lead to low detection performance. To address these issues, we propose a unified scene text detection system, namely Text Flow, by utilizing the minimum cost (min-cost) flow network model. With character candidates detected by cascade boosting, the min-cost flow network model integrates the last three sequential steps into a single process which solves the error accumulation problem at both character level and text line level effectively. The proposed technique has been tested on three public datasets, i.e, ICDAR2011 dataset, ICDAR2013 dataset and a multilingual dataset and it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all three datasets with much higher recall and F-score. The good performance on the multilingual dataset shows that the proposed technique can be used for the detection of texts in different languages."}

Differing from related works that have (i) coupled head and body pose learning by exploiting the limited range of orientations that the two can jointly take, or (ii) determined F-formations based on the mutual head (but not body) orientations of in- teractors, we present a unified framework to jointly infer both (i) and (ii). Apart from exploiting spatial and orien- tation relationships, we also integrate cues pertaining to temporal consistency and occlusions, which are beneficial while handling low-resolution data under surveillance set- tings. Efficacy of the joint inference framework reflects via increased head, body pose and F-formation estimation ac- curacy over the state-of-the-art, as confirmed by extensive experiments on two social datasets."}

For example, we probably have forgotten to turn the lights off before leaving a room or turn the stove off after cooking. In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of issuing notifications on actions that may be missed. This involves learning about interdependencies between actions and being able to predict an ongoing action while segmenting the input video stream. In order to show a proof of concept, we collected a new egocentric dataset, in which people wear a camera while making lattes. We show promising results on the extremely challenging task of issuing correct and timely reminders. We also show that our model reliably segments the actions, while predicting the ongoing one when only a few frames from the beginning of the action are observed. The overall prediction accuracy is 46.2% when only 10 frames of an action are seen (2/3 of a sec). Moreover, the overall recognition and segmentation accuracy is shown to be 72.7% when the whole activity sequence is observed. Finally, the online prediction and segmentation accuracy is 68.3% when the prediction is made at every time step."}

Our analysis lets us derive a simple, yet effective algorithm to robustify the SIM and make it applicable to realistic scenarios where the data is corrupted by noise. We justify our method by intuitive examples and the matrix perturbation theory. We then show how this approach can be extended to handle missing data, thus yielding an efficient and general subspace clustering algorithm.

In tracking-by-detection, a major challenge of online MOT is how to robustly associate noisy object detections on a new video frame with previously tracked objects. In this work, we formulate the online MOT problem as decision making in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), where the lifetime of an object is modeled with a MDP. Learning a similarity function for data association is equivalent to learning a policy for the MDP, and the policy learning is approached in a reinforcement learning fashion which benefits from both advantages of offline-learning and online-learning for data association. Moreover, our framework can naturally handle the birth/death and appearance/disappearance of targets by treating them as state transitions in the MDP while leveraging existing online single object tracking methods. We conduct experiments on the MOT Benchmark to verify the effectiveness of our method."}

Hitherto, the problem has been addressed through the application of canonical deep learning methods to regress from the image directly to the 3D shape and pose labels. These approaches, however, are problematic from two perspectives. First, they are minimizing the error between 3D shapes and pose labels - with little thought about the nature of this \"label error\" when reprojecting the shape back onto the image. Second, they rely on the onerous and ill-posed task of hand labeling natural images with respect to 3D shape and pose. In this paper we define the new task of pose-aware shape reconstruction from a single image, and we advocate that cheaper 2D annotations of objects silhouettes in natural images can be utilized. We design architectures of pose-aware shape reconstruction which reproject the predicted shape back on to the image using the predicted pose. Our evaluation on several object categories demonstrates the superiority of our method for predicting pose-aware 3D shapes from natural images."}

Our method considers a video to be a 1D sequence of clips, each one associated with its own semantics. The nature of these semantics -- natural language captions or other labels -- depends on the task at hand. A test video is processed by forming correspondences between its clips and the clips of reference videos with known semantics, following which, reference semantics can be transferred to the test video. We describe two matching methods, both designed to ensure that (a) reference clips appear similar to test clips and (b), taken together, the semantics of the selected reference clips is consistent and maintains temporal coherence. We use our method for video captioning on the LSMDC'16 benchmark, video summarization on the SumMe and TVSum benchmarks, Temporal Action Detection on the Thumos2015 benchmark, and sound prediction on the Greatest Hits benchmark. Our method not only surpasses the state of the art, in four out of five benchmarks, but importantly, it is the only single method we know of that was successfully applied to such a diverse range of tasks."}

Specifically, we try to solve the common problem that anchor-based detectors deteriorate dramatically as the objects become smaller. We make contributions in the following three aspects: 1) proposing a scale-equitable face detection framework to handle different scales of faces well. We tile anchors on a wide range of layers to ensure that all scales of faces have enough features for detection. Besides, we design anchor scales based on the effective receptive field and a proposed equal proportion interval principle; 2) improving the recall rate of small faces by a scale compensation anchor matching strategy; 3) reducing the false positive rate of small faces via a max-out background label. As a consequence, our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on all the common face detection benchmarks, including the AFW, PASCAL face, FDDB and WIDER FACE datasets, and can run at 36 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) for VGA-resolution images."}

One key pillar of these successes is mining relevant information from features in convolutional layers. However, how to better aggregate multi-level convolutional feature maps for salient object detection is underexplored. In this work, we present Amulet, a generic aggregating multi-level convolutional feature framework for salient object detection. Our framework first integrates multi-level feature maps into multiple resolutions, which simultaneously incorporate coarse semantics and fine details. Then it adaptively learns to combine these feature maps at each resolution and predict saliency maps with the combined features. Finally, the predicted results are efficiently fused to generate the final saliency map. In addition, to achieve accurate boundary inference and semantic enhancement, edge-aware feature maps in low-level layers and the predicted results of low resolution features are recursively embedded into the learning framework. By aggregating multi-level convolutional features in this efficient and flexible manner, the proposed saliency model provides accurate salient object labeling. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches in terms of near all compared evaluation metrics."}

While a patch-based sparse model imposes local structure, low-rankness of the grouped patches exploits non-local correlation. Applying either approach alone usually limits performance in various low-level vision tasks. In this work, we propose a novel video denoising method, based on an online tensor reconstruction scheme with a joint adaptive sparse and low-rank model, dubbed SALT. An efficient and unsupervised online unitary sparsifying transform learning method is introduced to impose adaptive sparsity on the fly. We develop an efficient 3D spatio-temporal data reconstruction framework based on the proposed online learning method, which exhibits low latency and can potentially handle streaming videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that combines adaptive sparsity and low-rankness for video denoising, and the first work of solving the proposed problem in an online fashion. We demonstrate video denoising results over commonly used videos from public datasets. Numerical experiments show that the proposed video denoising method outperforms competing methods."}

We present an efficient framework to annotate trajectories and use it to produce a MOT dataset of unprecedented size. A novel path supervision paradigm lets the annotator loosely track the object with a cursor while watching the video. This results in a path annotation for each object in the sequence. These path annotations, together with object detections, are fed into a two-step optimization to produce full bounding-box trajectories. Our experiments on existing datasets prove that our framework produces more accurate annotations than the state of the art and this in a fraction of the time. We further validate our approach by generating the PathTrack dataset, with more than 15,000 person trajectories in 720 sequences. We believe tracking approaches can benefit from a larger dataset like this one, just as was the case in object recognition. We show its potential by using it to re-train an off-the-shelf person matching network, originally trained on the MOT15 dataset, almost halving the misclassification rate. Additionally, training on our data consistently improves tracking results, both on our dataset and on MOT15.

Occlusions have remained one of the key challenges. In this paper, we propose a symmetric optical flow method to address the well-known chicken-and-egg relation between optical flow and occlusions. In contrast to many state-of-the-art methods that consider occlusions as outliers, possibly filtered out during post-processing, we highlight the importance of joint occlusion reasoning in the optimization and show how to utilize occlusion as an important cue for estimating optical flow. The key feature of our model is to fully exploit the symmetry properties that characterize optical flow and occlusions in the two consecutive images. Specifically through utilizing forward-backward consistency and occlusion-disocclusion symmetry in the energy, our model jointly estimates optical flow in both forward and backward direction, as well as consistent occlusion maps in both views. We demonstrate significant performance benefits on standard benchmarks, especially from the occlusion-disocclusion symmetry. On the challenging KITTI dataset we report the most accurate two-frame results to date."}

Crucially, the agent must decide where to look in the upcoming frames, when to reinitialize because it believes the target has been lost, and when to update its appearance model for the tracked object. Such decisions are typically made heuristically. Instead, we propose to learn an optimal decision-making policy by formulating tracking as a partially observable decision-making process (POMDP). We learn policies with deep reinforcement learning algorithms that need supervision (a reward signal) only when the track has gone awry. We demonstrate that sparse rewards allow us to quickly train on massive datasets, several orders of magnitude more than past work. Interestingly, by treating the data source of Internet videos as unlimited streams, we both learn and evaluate our trackers in a single, unified computational stream."}

The attentive deep features learned from the proposed HP-net bring unique advantages: (1) the model is capable of capturing multiple attentions from low-level to semantic-level, and (2) it explores the multi-scale selectiveness of attentive features to enrich the final feature representations for a pedestrian image. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed HP-net for pedestrian analysis on two tasks, i.e. pedestrian attribute recognition and person re-identification. Intensive experimental results have been provided to prove that the HP-net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various datasets."}

Tackling this question from a data-driven vision perspective, we propose to forecast visual style trends before they occur. We introduce the first approach to predict the future popularity of styles discovered from fashion images in an unsupervised manner. Using these styles as a basis, we train a forecasting model to represent their trends over time. The resulting model can hypothesize new mixtures of styles that will become popular in the future, discover style dynamics (trendy vs. classic), and name the key visual attributes that will dominate tomorrow's fashion. We demonstrate our idea applied to three datasets encapsulating 80,000 fashion products sold across six years on Amazon. Results indicate that fashion forecasting benefits greatly from visual analysis, much more than textual or meta-data cues surrounding products."}

This task is challenging due to lack of training data, as existing datasets are either in the wild images with 2D pose or in the lab images with 3D pose. We propose a weakly-supervised transfer learning method that uses mixed 2D and 3D labels in a unified deep neutral network that presents two-stage cascaded structure. Our network augments a state-of-the-art 2D pose estimation sub-network with a 3D depth regression sub-network. Unlike previous two stage approaches that train the two sub-networks sequentially and separately, our training is end-to-end and fully exploits the correlation between the 2D pose and depth estimation sub-tasks. The deep features are better learnt through shared representations. In doing so, the 3D pose labels in controlled lab environments are transferred to in the wild images. In addition, we introduce a 3D geometric constraint to regularize the 3D pose prediction, which is effective in the absence of ground truth depth labels. Our method achieves competitive results on both 2D and 3D benchmarks."}

Subsequently we identify a sparse distribution estimation scheme, Directed Sparse Sampling, and employ it in a single end-to-end CNN based detection model. This methodology extends and formalizes previous state-of-the-art detection models with an additional emphasis on high evaluation rates and reduced manual engineering. We introduce two novelties, a corner based region-of-interest estimator and a deconvolution based CNN model. The resulting model is scene adaptive, does not require manually defined reference bounding boxes and produces highly competitive results on MSCOCO, Pascal VOC 2007 and Pascal VOC 2012 with real-time evaluation rates. Further analysis suggests our model performs particularly well when finegrained object localization is desirable. We argue that this advantage stems from the significantly larger set of available regions-of-interest relative to other methods. Source-code is available from: https://github.com/lachlants/denet"}

In this paper, we first address a key challenge for online hashing: the binary codes for indexed data must be recomputed to keep pace with updates to the hash functions. We propose an efficient quality measure for hash functions, based on an information-theoretic quantity, mutual information, and use it successfully as a criterion to eliminate unnecessary hash table updates. Next, we also show how to optimize the mutual information objective using stochastic gradient descent. We thus develop a novel hashing method, MIHash, that can be used in both online and batch settings. Experiments on image retrieval benchmarks (including a 2.5M image dataset) confirm the effectiveness of our formulation, both in reducing hash table recomputations and in learning high-quality hash functions."}

We provide a reasonable analyses that our construction is difficult to defeat, and show experimentally that our method is hard to defeat with both Type I and Type II attacks using several standard networks and datasets. This SafetyNet architecture is used to an important and novel application SceneProof, which can reliably detect whether an image is a picture of a real scene or not. SceneProof applies to images captured with depth maps (RGBD images) and checks if a pair of image and depth map is consistent. It relies on the relative difficulty of producing naturalistic depth maps for images in post processing. We demonstrate that our SafetyNet is robust to adversarial examples built from currently known attacking approaches."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2017", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "DualNet", "Title": "Learn Complementary Features for Image Recognition", "Abstract": "In this work we propose a novel framework named DualNet aiming at learning more accurate representation for image recognition. Here two parallel neural networks are coordinated to learn complementary features and thus a wider network is constructed. Specifically, we logically divide an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network into two functional parts, i.e., feature extractor and image classifier. The extractors of two subnetworks are placed side by side, which exactly form the feature extractor of DualNet. Then the two-stream features are aggregated to the final classifier for overall classification, while two auxiliary classifiers are appended behind the feature extractor of each subnetwork to make the separately learned features discriminative alone. The complementary constraint is imposed by weighting the three classifiers, which is indeed the key of DualNet. The corresponding training strategy is also proposed, consisting of iterative training and joint finetuning, to make the two subnetworks cooperate well with each other. Finally, DualNet based on the well-known CaffeNet, VGGNet, NIN and ResNet are thoroughly investigated and experimentally evaluated on multiple datasets including CIFAR-100, Stanford Dogs and UEC FOOD-100. The results demonstrate that DualNet can really help learn more accurate image representation, and thus result in higher accuracy for recognition. In particular, the performance on CIFAR-100 is state-of-the-art compared to the recent works."}

However, transferring to a target domain with significant domain shifts but no paired training data (referred to as cross-domain image captioning) remains largely unexplored. We propose a novel adversarial training procedure to leverage unpaired data in the target domain. Two critic networks are introduced to guide the captioner, namely domain critic and multi-modal critic. The domain critic assesses whether the generated sentences are indistinguishable from sentences in the target domain. The multi-modal critic assesses whether an image and its generated sentence are a valid pair. During training, the critics and captioner act as adversaries -- captioner aims to generate indistinguishable sentences, whereas critics aim at distinguishing them. The assessment improves the captioner through policy gradient updates. During inference, we further propose a novel critic-based planning method to select high-quality sentences without additional supervision (e.g., tags). To evaluate, we use MSCOCO as the source domain and four other datasets (CUB-200-2011, Oxford-102, TGIF, and Flickr30k) as the target domains. Our method consistently performs well on all datasets. In particular, on CUB-200-2011, we achieve 21.8% CIDEr-D improvement after adaptation. Utilizing critics during inference further gives another 4.5% boost."}

Aiming at domestic cooking and food management, VegFru categorizes vegetables and fruits according to their eating characteristics, and each image contains at least one edible part of vegetables or fruits with the same cooking usage.

Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say logits for 'dog' or even a caption), flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g. VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g. VQA) or reinforcement learning, and needs no architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (d) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a 'stronger' deep network from a 'weaker' one even when both make identical predictions.

Most of current solutions employ generic image parsing models that treat all scales and locations in the images equally and do not consider the geometry property of car-captured urban scene images. Thus, they suffer from heterogeneous object scales caused by perspective projection of cameras on actual scenes and inevitably encounter parsing failures on distant objects as well as other boundary and recognition errors. In this work, we propose a new FoveaNet model to fully exploit the perspective geometry of scene images and address the common failures of generic parsing models. FoveaNet estimates the perspective geometry of a scene image through a convolutional network which integrates supportive evidence from contextual objects within the image. Based on the perspective geometry information, FoveaNet \"undoes\" the camera perspective projection--analyzing regions in the space of the actual scene, and thus provides much more reliable parsing results. Furthermore, to effectively address the recognition errors, FoveaNet introduces a new dense CRF model that takes the perspective geometry as a prior potential. We evaluate FoveaNet on two urban scene parsing datasets, Cityspaces and CamVid, which demonstrates that FoveaNet can outperform all the well-established baselines and provide new state-of-the-art performance."}

For example, to answer \"is there an equal number of balls and boxes?\" we can look for balls, look for boxes, count them, and compare the results. The recently proposed Neural Module Network (NMN) architecture implements this approach to question answering by parsing questions into linguistic substructures and assembling question-specific deep networks from smaller modules that each solve one subtask. However, existing NMN implementations rely on brittle off-the-shelf parsers, and are restricted to the module configurations proposed by these parsers rather than learning them from data. In this paper, we propose End-to-End Module Networks (N2NMNs), which learn to reason by directly predicting instance-specific network layouts without the aid of a parser. Our model learns to generate network structures (by imitating expert demonstrations) while simultaneously learning network parameters (using the downstream task loss). Experimental results on the new CLEVR dataset targeted at compositional question answering show that N2NMNs achieve an error reduction of nearly 50% relative to state-of-the-art attentional approaches, while discovering interpretable network architectures specialized for each question."}

To reduce the ambiguities of the non-rigid deformation parameterization on the surface graph nodes, we take advantage of the internal articulated motion prior for human performance and contribute a skeleton-embedded surface fusion (SSF) method. The key feature of our method is that it jointly solves for both the skeleton and graph-node deformations based on information of the attachments between the skeleton and the graph nodes. The attachments are also updated frame by frame based on the fused surface geometry and the computed deformations. Overall, our method enables increasingly denoised, detailed, and complete surface reconstruction as well as the updating of the skeleton and attachments as the temporal depth frames are fused. Experimental results show that our method exhibits substantially improved nonrigid motion fusion performance and tracking robustness compared with previous state-of-the-art fusion methods. We also contribute a dataset for the quantitative evaluation of fusion-based dynamic scene reconstruction algorithms using a single depth camera."}

It synchronizes small lens oscillations with a photosensor to produce real-time depth maps by means of differential defocus, and it couples these oscillations with bigger lens deformations that adapt the defocus working range to track objects over large axial distances. To create the focal track sensor, we derive a texture-invariant family of equations that relate image derivatives to scene depth when a lens changes its focal length differentially. Based on these equations, we design a feed-forward sequence of computations that: robustly incorporates image derivatives at multiple scales; produces confidence maps along with depth; and can be trained end-to-end to mitigate against noise, aberrations, and other non-idealities.

These ranked image sets can be automatically generated without laborious human labeling. We then use fine-tuning to transfer the knowledge represented in the trained Siamese Network to a traditional CNN that estimates absolute image quality from single images. We demonstrate how our approach can be made significantly more efficient than traditional Siamese Networks by forward propagating a batch of images through a single network and backpropagating gradients derived from all pairs of images in the batch. Experiments on the TID2013 benchmark show that we improve the state-of-the-art by over 5%.

In these models, a key issue is to find a proper network architecture that best fits for the task of SOD. Toward this end, this paper proposes two-stream fixation-semantic CNNs, whose architecture is inspired by the fact that salient objects in complex images can be unambiguously annotated by selecting the pre-segmented semantic objects that receive the highest fixation density in eye-tracking experiments. In the two-stream CNNs, a fixation stream is pre-trained on eye-tracking data whose architecture well fits for the task of fixation prediction, and a semantic stream is pre-trained on images with semantic tags that has a proper architecture for semantic perception. By fusing these two streams into an inception-segmentation module and jointly fine-tuning them on images with manually annotated salient objects, the proposed networks show impressive performance in segmenting salient objects. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms 10 state-of-the-art models (5 deep, 5 non-deep) on 4 datasets."}

In recent years, many algorithms have been proposed that approach this problem by designing suitable feature representations for images of persons or by training appropriate distance metrics that learn to distinguish between images of different persons. Aggregating the results from multiple algorithms for person re-identification is a relatively less-explored area of research. In this paper, we formulate an algorithm that maps the ranking process in a person re-identification algorithm to a problem in graph theory. We then extend this formulation to allow for the use of results from multiple algorithms to make a consensus-based decision for the person re-identification problem. The algorithm is unsupervised and takes into account only the matching scores generated by multiple algorithms for creating a consensus of results. Further, we show how the graph theoretic problem can be solved by a two-step process. First, we obtain a rough estimate of the solution using a greedy algorithm. Then, we extend the construction of the proposed graph so that the problem can be efficiently solved by means of Ant Colony Optimization, a heuristic path-searching algorithm for complex graphs. While we present the algorithm in the context of person re-identification, it can potentially be applied to the general problem of ranking items based on a consensus of multiple sets of scores or metric values."}

The dataset consists of 100 videos (380K frames) captured with now commonly available higher frame rate (240 FPS) cameras from real world scenarios. All frames are annotated with axis aligned bounding boxes and all sequences are manually labelled with nine visual attributes - such as occlusion, fast motion, background clutter, etc. Our benchmark provides an extensive evaluation of many recent and state-of-the-art trackers on higher frame rate sequences. We ranked each of these trackers according to their tracking accuracy and real-time performance. One of our surprising conclusions is that at higher frame rates, simple trackers such as correlation filters outperform complex methods based on deep networks. This suggests that for practical applications (such as in robotics or embedded vision), one needs to carefully tradeoff bandwidth constraints associated with higher frame rate acquisition, computational costs of real-time analysis, and the required application accuracy. Our dataset and benchmark allows for the first time (to our knowledge) systematic exploration of such issues, and will be made available to allow for further research in this space."}

Thus, the estimated flow is not equally reliable across the image. To that end, post-hoc confidence measures have been introduced to assess the per-pixel reliability of the flow. We overcome the artificial separation of optical flow and confidence estimation by introducing a method that jointly predicts optical flow and its underlying uncertainty. Starting from common energy-based formulations, we rely on the corresponding posterior distribution of the flow given the images. We derive a variational inference scheme based on mean field, which incorporates best practices from energy minimization. An uncertainty measure is obtained along the flow at every pixel as the (marginal) entropy of the variational distribution. We demonstrate the flexibility of our probabilistic approach by applying it to two different energies and on two benchmarks. We not only obtain flow results that are competitive with the underlying energy minimization approach, but also a reliable uncertainty measure that significantly outperforms existing post-hoc approaches."}

This paper presents an approach to embed 3D context into the topology of a neural network trained to perform holistic scene understanding. Given a depth image depicting a 3D scene, our network aligns the observed scene with a predefined 3D scene template, and then reasons about the existence and location of each object within the scene template. In doing so, our model recognizes multiple objects in a single forward pass of a 3D convolutional neural network, capturing both global scene and local object information simultaneously. To create training data for this 3D network, we generate partly hallucinated depth images which are rendered by replacing real objects with a repository of CAD models of the same object category.

{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2017", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Adversarial PoseNet", "Title": "A Structure-Aware Convolutional Network for Human Pose Estimation", "Abstract": "For human pose estimation in monocular images, joint occlusions and overlapping upon human bodies often result in deviated pose predictions. Under these circumstances, bi- ologically implausible pose predictions may be produced. In contrast, human vision is able to predict poses by exploiting geometric constraints of joint inter-connectivity. To address the problem by incorporating priors about the structure of human bodies, we propose a novel structure-aware convo- lutional network to implicitly take such priors into account during training of the deep network. Explicit learning of such constraints is typically challenging. Instead, we design discriminators to distinguish the real poses from the fake ones (such as biologically implausible ones). If the pose generator (G) generates results that the discriminator fails to distinguish from real ones, the network successfully learns the priors. To better capture the structure dependency of human body joints, the generator G is designed in a stacked multi-task manner to predict poses as well as occlusion heatmaps. Then, the pose and occlusion heatmaps are sent to the discrimina- tors to predict the likelihood of the pose being real. Training of the network follows the strategy of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The effectiveness of the pro- posed network is evaluated on two widely used human pose estimation benchmark datasets. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and almost always generates plausible human pose predictions."}

Most existing unsupervised ZSL methods aim to learn a model for directly comparing image features and class names. However, this proves to be a difficult task due to dominance of non-visual semantics in underlying vector-space embeddings of class names. To address this issue, we discriminatively learn a word representation such that the similarities between class and combination of attribute names fall in line with the visual similarity. Contrary to the traditional zero-shot learning approaches that are built upon attribute presence, our approach bypasses the laborious attribute-class relation annotations for unseen classes. In addition, our proposed approach renders text-only training possible, hence, the training can be augmented without the need to collect additional image data. The experimental results show that our method yields state-of-the-art results for unsupervised ZSL in three benchmark datasets."}

For example, finding a large labeled dataset containing instances in a particular kitchen is unlikely. Each new environment with new instances requires expensive data collection and annotation. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to generate large annotated instance datasets with minimal effort. Our key insight is that ensuring only patch-level realism provides enough training signal for current object detector models. We automatically `cut' object instances and `paste' them on random backgrounds. A naive way to do this results in pixel artifacts which result in poor performance for trained models. We show how to make detectors ignore these artifacts during training and generate data that gives competitive performance on real data. Our method outperforms existing synthesis approaches and when combined with real images improves relative performance by more than 21% on benchmark datasets. In a cross-domain setting, our synthetic data combined with just 10% real data outperforms models trained on all real data."}

These fully supervised models need additional annotated images to classify objects in every new scenario, a task that is infeasible. However, sources such as e-commerce websites and field guides provide annotated images for many classes. In this work, we study fine-grained domain adaptation as a step towards overcoming the dataset shift between easily acquired annotated images and the real world. Adaptation has not been studied in the fine-grained setting where annotations such as attributes could be used to increase performance. Our work uses an attribute based multitask adaptaion loss to increase accuracy from a baseline of 3.4% to 19% in the semi-supervised adaptation case. Prior domain adaptation works have been benchmarked on small datasets such as [45] with a total of 795 images for some domains, or simplistic datasets such as [40] consisting of digits. We perform experiments on a new challenging fine-grained dataset of cars consisting of 1, 095, 021 images of 2, 657 categories of cars drawn from e-commerce websites and Google Street View."}

We propose a novel approach named Second-Order Response Transform (SORT), which appends element-wise product transform to the linear sum of a two-branch network module. A direct advantage of SORT is to facilitate cross-branch response propagation, so that each branch can update its weights based on the current status of the other branch. Moreover, SORT augments the family of transform operations and increases the nonlinearity of the network, making it possible to learn flexible functions to fit the complicated distribution of feature space. SORT can be applied to a wide range of network architectures, including a branched variant of a chain-styled network and a residual network, with very light-weighted modifications. We observe consistent accuracy gain on both small (CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN) and big (ILSVRC2012) datasets. In addition, SORT is very efficient, as the extra computation overhead is less than 5%."}

However, most of the recent solutions in feature selection are not robust across different and heterogeneous set of data. In this paper, we address this issue proposing a robust probabilistic latent graph-based feature selection algorithm that performs the ranking step while considering all the possible subsets of features, as paths on a graph, bypassing the combinatorial problem analytically. An appealing characteristic of the approach is that it aims to discover an abstraction behind low-level sensory data, that is, relevancy. Relevancy is modelled as a latent variable in a PLSA-inspired generative process that allows the investigation of the importance of a feature when injected into an arbitrary set of cues. The proposed method has been tested on ten diverse benchmarks, and compared against eleven state of the art feature selection methods. Results show that the proposed approach attains the highest performance levels across many different scenarios and difficulties, thereby confirming its strong robustness while setting a new state of the art in feature selection domain."}

Through experiments, we show that ChromaTag is significantly faster than current fiducial markers while achieving similar or better detection accuracy. We also show how tag size and viewing direction effect detection accuracy. Our contribution is significant because fiducial markers are often used in real-time applications (e.g. marker assisted robot navigation) where heavy computation is required by other parts of the system."}

In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised scene text detection method (WeText) that trains robust and accurate scene text detection models by learning from unannotated or weakly annotated data. With a \"light\" supervised model trained on a small fully annotated dataset, we explore semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning on a large unannotated dataset and a large weakly annotated dataset, respectively. For the unsupervised learning, the light supervised model is applied to the unannotated dataset to search for more character training samples, which are further combined with the small annotated dataset to retrain a superior character detection model. For the weakly supervised learning, the character searching is guided by high-level annotations of words/text lines that are widely available and also much easier to prepare. In addition, we design an unified scene character detector by adapting regression based deep networks, which greatly relieves the error accumulation issue that widely exists in most traditional approaches. Extensive experiments across different unannotated and weakly annotated datasets show that the scene text detection performance can be clearly boosted under both scenarios, where the weakly supervised learning can achieve the state-of-the-art performance by using only 229 fully annotated scene text images."}

{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2017", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Toward Perceptually-Consistent Stereo", "Title": "A Scanline Study", "Abstract": "Two types of information exist in a stereo pair: correlation (matching) and decorrelation (half-occlusion). Vision science has shown that both types of information are used in the visual cortex, and that people can perceive depth even when correlation cues are absent or very weak, a capability that remains absent from most computational stereo systems. As a step toward stereo algorithms that are more consistent with these perceptual phenomena, we re-examine the topic of scanline stereo as energy minimization. We represent a disparity profile as a piecewise smooth function with explicit breakpoints between its smooth pieces, and we show this allows correlation and decorrelation to be integrated into an objective that requires only two types of local information: the correlation and its spatial gradient. Experimentally, we show the global optimum of this objective matches human perception on a broad collection of wellknown perceptual stimuli, and that it also provides reasonable piecewise-smooth interpretations of depth in natural images, even without exploiting monocular boundary cues."}

In order to leverage the keypoint information, we devise a Convolutional Neural Network called Click-Here CNN (CH-CNN) that integrates the keypoint information with activations from the layers that process the image. It transforms the keypoint information into a 2D map that can be used to weigh features from certain parts of the image more heavily. The weighted sum of these spatial features is combined with global image features to provide relevant information to the prediction layers. To train our network, we collect a novel dataset of 3D keypoint annotations on thousands of CAD models, and synthetically render millions of images with 2D keypoint information. On test instances from PASCAL 3D+, our model achieves a mean class accuracy of 90.7%, whereas the state-of-the-art baseline only obtains 85.7% mean class accuracy, justifying our argument for human-in-the-loop inference."}

Given an input image of a person and a sentence describing a different outfit, our model \"redresses\" the person as desired, while at the same time keeping the wearer and her/his pose unchanged. Generating new outfits with precise regions conforming to a language description while retaining wearer's body structure is a new challenging task. Existing generative adversarial networks are not ideal in ensuring global coherence of structure given both the input photograph and language description as conditions. We address this challenge by decomposing the complex generative process into two conditional stages. In the first stage, we generate a plausible semantic segmentation map that obeys the wearer's pose as a latent spatial arrangement. An effective spatial constraint is formulated to guide the generation of this semantic segmentation map. In the second stage, a generative model with a newly proposed compositional mapping layer is used to render the final image with precise regions and textures conditioned on this map. We extended the DeepFashion dataset [8] by collecting sentence descriptions for 79K images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. A user study is also conducted."}

When dealing with very low resolution (LR) images, the performance of these CNN based methods greatly degrades. Meanwhile, these methods tend to produce over-smoothed outputs and miss some textural details. To address these challenges, this paper presents a wavelet-based CNN approach that can ultra-resolve a very low resolution face image of 16x16 or smaller pixel-size to its larger version of multiple scaling factors (2x, 4x, 8x and even 16x) in a unified framework. Different from conventional CNN methods directly inferring HR images, our approach firstly learns to predict the LR's corresponding series of HR's wavelet coefficients before reconstructing HR images from them. To capture both global topology information and local texture details of human faces, we present a flexible and extensible convolutional neural network with three types of loss: wavelet prediction loss, texture loss and full-image loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves more appealing results both quantitatively and qualitatively than state-of-the-art super-resolution methods."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2017", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Learning Proximal Operators", "Title": "Using Denoising Networks for Regularizing Inverse Imaging Problems", "Abstract": "While variational methods have been among the most powerful tools for solving linear inverse problems in imaging, deep (convolutional) neural networks have recently taken the lead in many challenging benchmarks. A remaining drawback of deep learning approaches is their requirement for an expensive retraining whenever the specific problem, the noise level, noise type, or desired measure of fidelity changes. On the contrary, variational methods have a plug-and-play nature as they usually consist of separate data fidelity and regularization terms. In this paper we study the possibility of replacing the proximal operator of the regularization used in many convex energy minimization algorithms by a denoising neural network. The latter therefore serves as an implicit natural image prior, while the data term can still be chosen independently. Using a fixed denoising neural network in exemplary problems of image deconvolution with different blur kernels and image demosaicking, we obtain state-of-the-art reconstruction results. These indicate the high generalizability of our approach and a reduction of the need for problem-specific training. Additionally, we discuss novel results on the analysis of possible optimization algorithms to incorporate the network into, as well as the choices of algorithm parameters and their relation to the noise level the neural network is trained on."}

We argue that estimation of object scales in images is helpful for generating object proposals, especially for supermarket images where object scales are usually within a small range. Therefore, we propose to estimate object scales of images before generating object proposals. The proposed method for predicting object scales is called ScaleNet. To validate the effectiveness of ScaleNet, we build three supermarket datasets, two of which are real-world datasets used for testing and the other one is a synthetic dataset used for training. In short, we extend the previous state-of-the-art object proposal methods by adding a scale prediction phase. The resulted method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the supermarket datasets by a large margin. We also show that the approach works for object proposal on other natural images and it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art object proposal methods on the MS COCO dataset. The supermarket datasets, the virtual supermarkets, and the tools for creating more synthetic datasets will be made public."}

Many seemingly distinct annotations (e.g., semantic segmentation and visual questions answering (VQA)) are inherently connected in that they reveal different levels and perspectives of human understandings about the same visual scenes --- and even the same set of MS COCO images. The popularity of MS COCO could strongly correlate those annotations and tasks. Explicitly linking them up, as we envision, can significantly benefit not only individual tasks but also the overarching goal of unified vision-language understand. We present the preliminary work of linking the instance segmentations provided by MS COCO to the questions and answers (QA) in the VQA dataset. We call the collected links visual questions and segmentation answers (VQS). They transfer human supervision between the previously separate tasks, offer more effective leverage to existing problems, and also open the door for new tasks and richer models. We study two applications of the VQS data in this paper: supervised attention for VQA and a novel question-focused semantic segmentation task. For the former, we obtain state-of-the-art results on the VQA real multiple-choice task by simply augmenting multilayer perceptrons with some attention features that are learned by using the segmentation-QA links as explicit supervision. To put the latter in perspective, we study two plausible methods and an oracle upper bound."}

Previous approaches focus on either combining a spatial regularizer with hand-crafted features, or learning a correspondence model for appearance only. We propose instead a convolutional neural network architecture, called SCNet, for learning a geometrically plausible model for semantic correspondence. SCNet uses region proposals as matching primitives, and explicitly incorporates geometric consistency in its loss function. It is trained on image pairs obtained from the PASCAL VOC 2007 keypoint dataset, and a comparative evaluation on several standard benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed approach substantially outperforms both recent deep learning architectures and previous methods based on hand-crafted features."}

Doing so requires estimating the volume of the cup, approximating the amount of water in the pitcher, and predicting the behavior of water when we tilt the pitcher. Very little attention in computer vision has been made to liquids and their containers. In this paper, we study liquid containers and their contents, and propose methods to estimate the volume of containers, approximate the amount of liquid in them, and perform comparative volume estimations all from a single RGB image. Furthermore, we show the results of the proposed model for predicting the behavior of liquids inside containers when one tilts the containers. We also introduce a new dataset of Containers Of liQuid contEnt (COQE) that contains more than 5,000 images of 10,000 liquid containers in context labelled with volume, amount of content, bounding box annotation, and corresponding similar 3D CAD models."}

State-of-the-art object objectors rely heavily on the off-the-shelf networks pre-trained on large-scale classification datasets like ImageNet, which incurs learning bias due to the difference on both the loss functions and the category distributions between classification and detection tasks. Model fine-tuning for the detection task could alleviate this bias to some extent but not fundamentally. Besides, transferring pre-trained models from classification to detection between discrepant domains is even more difficult (e.g. RGB to depth images). A better solution to tackle these two critical problems is to train object detectors from scratch, which motivates our proposed DSOD. Previous efforts in this direction mostly failed due to much more complicated loss functions and limited training data in object detection. In DSOD, we contribute a set of design principles for training object detectors from scratch. One of the key findings is that deep supervision, enabled by dense layer-wise connections, plays a critical role in learning a good detector. Combining with several other principles, we develop DSOD following the single-shot detection (SSD) framework. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that DSOD can achieve better results than the state-of-the-art solutions with much more compact models. For instance, DSOD outperforms SSD on all three benchmarks with real-time detection speed, while requires only 1/2 parameters to SSD and 1/10 parameters to Faster RCNN."}

We tackle rainy and low illumination conditions, which have not been extensively studied until now due to clear challenges. For example, images taken under rainy days are subject to low illumination, while wet roads cause light reflection and distort the appearance of lane and road markings. At night, color distortion occurs under limited illumination. As a result, no benchmark dataset exists and only a few developed algorithms work under poor weather conditions. To address this shortcoming, we build up a lane and road marking benchmark which consists of about 20,000 images with 17 lane and road marking classes under four different scenarios: no rain, rain, heavy rain, and night. We train and evaluate several versions of the proposed multi-task network and validate the importance of each task. The resulting approach, VPGNet, can detect and classify lanes and road markings, and predict a vanishing point with a single forward pass. Experimental results show that our approach achieves high accuracy and robustness under various conditions in real-time (20 fps). The benchmark and the VPGNet model will be publicly available."}

Instead of collecting a large number of annotated images of each city of interest to train or refine the segmenter, we propose an unsupervised learning approach to adapt road scene segmenters across different cities. By utilizing Google Street View and its time-machine feature, we can collect unannotated images for each road scene at different times, so that the associated static-object priors can be extracted accordingly. By advancing a joint global and class-specific domain adversarial learning framework, adaptation of pre-trained segmenters to that city can be achieved without the need of any user annotation or interaction. We show that our method improves the performance of semantic segmentation in multiple cities across continents, while it performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches requiring annotated training data."}

Hence, weak supervision using only image tags could have a significant impact in semantic segmentation. Recent years have seen great progress in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation, whether from a single image or from videos.

In practical applications, such as autonomous navigation, it is often crucial to reason about multiple background classes. In this paper, we introduce an approach to doing so by making use of classifier heatmaps. We then develop a two-stream deep architecture that jointly leverages appearance and motion, and design a loss based on our heatmaps to train it. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of our classifier heatmaps and of our two-stream architecture on challenging urban scene datasets and on the YouTube-Objects benchmark, where we obtain state-of-the-art results."}

Unlike existing approaches that rely on a sequence of low-level image processing heuristics, we adopt a learning-based approach. A neural architecture first transforms a rasterized image to a set of junctions that represent low-level geometric and semantic information (e.g., wall corners or door end-points). Integer programming is then formulated to aggregate junctions into a set of simple primitives (e.g., wall lines, door lines, or icon boxes) to produce a vectorized floorplan, while ensuring a topologically and geometrically consistent result. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves around 90% precision and recall, getting to the range of production-ready performance. The vector representation allows 3D model popup for better indoor scene visualization, direct model manipulation for architectural remodeling, and further computational applications such as data analysis. Our system is efficient: we have converted hundred thousand production-level floorplan images into the vector representation and generated 3D popup models."}

The resulting technique can be used for a variety of applications in diverse physical settings. From standard RGB video recordings of the variations in intensity, we use edge cameras to recover a 1-D video that reveals the number and trajectories of people moving in an occluded scene. We further show that adjacent vertical edges, such as those that arise in the case of an open doorway, yield a stereo camera from which the 2-D location of hidden, moving objects can be recovered.

Unlike traditional methods that focus on either extracting good geometric primitives or obtaining proper arrangements of primitives, the emphasis of this work lies in intersecting the primitives (planes only) and seeking for an appropriate combination of them to obtain a manifold polygonal surface model without boundary. We show that reconstruction from point clouds can be cast as a binary labeling problem. Our method is based on a hypothesizing and selection strategy. We first generate a reasonably large set of face candidates by intersecting the extracted planar primitives. Then an optimal subset of the candidate faces is selected through optimization. Our optimization is based on a binary linear programming formulation under hard constraints that enforce the final polygonal surface model to be manifold and watertight. Experiments on point clouds from various sources demonstrate that our method can generate lightweight polygonal surface models of arbitrary piecewise planar objects. Besides, our method is capable of recovering sharp features and is robust to noise, outliers, and missing data."}

Although data-driven deep learning methods have been proposed to address this problem by seeking solutions from ample face data, this problem is still challenging because it is intrinsically ill-posed. This paper proposes a Two-Pathway Generative Adversarial Network (TP-GAN) for photorealistic frontal view synthesis by simultaneously perceiving global structures and local details. Four landmark located patch networks are proposed to attend to local textures in addition to the commonly used global encoder-decoder network. Except for the novel architecture, we make this ill-posed problem well constrained by introducing a combination of adversarial loss, symmetry loss and identity preserving loss. The combined loss function leverages both frontal face distribution and pre-trained discriminative deep face models to guide an identity preserving inference of frontal views from profiles. Different from previous deep learning methods that mainly rely on intermediate features for recognition, our method directly leverages the synthesized identity preserving image for downstream tasks like face recognition and attribution estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only presents compelling perceptual results but also outperforms state-of-the-art results on large pose face recognition."}

Our method integrates feature extraction, response map generation as well as model update into the neural networks for an end-to-end training. To reduce model degradation during online update, we apply residual learning to take appearance changes into account. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CREST tracker performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers."}

However, these challenges are omnipresent in dynamic road scenes, which is the focus of this work. Our main contribution is to overcome these 3D motion estimation problems by exploiting recognition. In particular, we investigate the importance of recognition granularity, from coarse 2D bounding box estimates over 2D instance segmentations to fine-grained 3D object part predictions. We compute these cues using CNNs trained on a newly annotated dataset of stereo images and integrate them into a CRF-based model for robust 3D scene flow estimation - an approach we term Instance Scene Flow. We analyze the importance of each recognition cue in an ablation study and observe that the instance segmentation cue is by far strongest, in our setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the challenging KITTI 2015 scene flow benchmark where we achieve state-of-the-art performance at the time of submission."}

They help to learn high level associations between question meaning and visual concepts in the image, but they suffer from huge dimensionality issues. We introduce MUTAN, a multimodal tensor-based Tucker decomposition to efficiently parametrize bilinear interactions between visual and textual representations. Additionally to the Tucker framework, we design a low-rank matrix-based decomposition to explicitly constrain the interaction rank. With MUTAN, we control the complexity of the merging scheme while keeping nice interpretable fusion relations. We show how the Tucker decomposition framework generalizes some of the latest VQA architectures, providing state-of-the-art results."}

Our algorithm accepts a query as sketched shape, and a set of one or more contextual images specifying the desired visual aesthetic. A triplet network is used to learn a feature embedding capable of measuring style similarity independent of structure, delivering significant gains over previous networks for style discrimination. We incorporate this model within a hierarchical triplet network to unify and learn a joint space from two discriminatively trained streams for style and structure. We demonstrate that this space enables, for the first time, style-constrained sketch search over a diverse domain of digital artwork comprising graphics, paintings and drawings. We also briefly explore alternative query modalities."}

It also provides perfect camera poses and depth data, allowing investigation into geometric computer vision problems such as optical flow, camera pose estimation, and 3D scene labelling tasks. Random sampling permits virtually unlimited scene configurations, and here we provide 5M rendered RGB-D images from 16K randomly generated 3D trajectories in synthetic layouts, with random but physically simulated object configurations. We compare the semantic segmentation performance of network weights produced from pre-training on RGB images from our dataset against generic VGG-16 ImageNet weights. After fine-tuning on the SUN RGB-D and NYUv2 real-world datasets we find in both cases that the synthetically pre-trained network outperforms the VGG-16 weights. When synthetic pre-training includes a depth channel (something ImageNet cannot natively provide) the performance is greater still. This suggests that large-scale high-quality synthetic RGB datasets with task-specific labels can be more useful for pre-training than real-world generic pre-training such as ImageNet.

We make the following contributions: i) we extend previous medial point detection methods for color images, by associating each medial point with a local scale; ii) inspired by the invertibility property of the binary MAT, we also associate each medial point with a local encoding that allows us to invert the AMAT, reconstructing the input image; iii) we describe a clustering scheme that takes advantage of the additional scale and appearance information to group individual points into medial branches, providing a shape decomposition of the underlying image regions. In our experiments, we show state-of-the-art performance in medial point detection on Berkeley Medial AXes (BMAX500), a new dataset of medial axes based on the BSDS500 database, and good generalization on the SK506 and WH-SYMMAX datasets. We also measure the quality of reconstructed images from BMAX500, obtained by inverting their computed AMAT. Our approach delivers significantly better reconstruction quality wrt to three baselines, using just 10% of the image pixels.

Our approach models an image as a composition of label and latent attributes in a probabilistic model. By varying the fine-grained category label fed into the resulting generative model, we can generate images in a specific category with randomly drawn values on a latent attribute vector. Our approach has two novel aspects. First, we adopt a cross entropy loss for the discriminative and classifier network, but a mean discrepancy objective for the generative network. This kind of asymmetric loss function makes the GAN training more stable. Second, we adopt an encoder network to learn the relationship between the latent space and the real image space, and use pairwise feature matching to keep the structure of generated images. We experiment with natural images of faces, flowers, and birds, and demonstrate that the proposed models are capable of generating realistic and diverse samples with fine-grained category labels. We further show that our models can be applied to other tasks, such as image inpainting, super-resolution, and data augmentation for training better face recognition models."}

Depending on the task complexity, thousands to millions of labeled image pairs are needed to train a conditional GAN. However, human labeling is expensive, even impractical, and large quantities of data may not always be available. Inspired by dual learning from natural language translation, we develop a novel mechanism, which enables image translators to be trained from two sets of images from two domains. In our architecture, the primal GAN learns to translate images from domain U to those in domain V, while the dual GAN learns to invert the task. The closed loop made by the primal and dual tasks allows images from either domain to be translated and then reconstructed. Hence a loss function that accounts for the reconstruction error of images can be used to train the translators. Experiments on multiple image translation tasks with unlabeled data show considerable performance gain of DualGAN over a single GAN. For some tasks, DualGAN can even achieve comparable or slightly better results than conditional GAN trained on fully labeled data."}

Our work is motivated by the fact that existing models are often tested only on datasets that require excessively high-level reasoning or mostly contain instances accessible through single frame inferences. Hence, it is difficult to measure capacity and flexibility of trained models, and existing techniques often rely on ad-hoc implementations of deep neural networks without clear insight into datasets and models. We are particularly interested in understanding temporal relationships between video events to solve VideoQA problems; this is because reasoning temporal dependency is one of the most distinct components in videos from images. To address this objective, we automatically generate a customized synthetic VideoQA dataset using   Super Mario Bros.  gameplay videos so that it contains events with different levels of reasoning complexity. Using the dataset, we show that properly constructed datasets with events in various complexity levels are critical to learn effective models and improve overall performance."}

SBGAR consists of two stages: in stage I, we use a LSTM model to generate a caption for each video frame; in stage II, another LSTM model is trained to predict the final activity categories based on these generated captions. We evaluate SBGAR using two well-known datasets: the Collective Activity Dataset and the Volleyball Dataset. Our experimental results show that SBGAR improves the group activity recognition accuracy with shorter computation time compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}

For three publicly available egocentric datasets, we uncover inconsistencies in ground truth temporal bounds within and across annotators and datasets. We systematically assess the robustness of state-of-the-art approaches to changes in labeled temporal bounds, for object interaction recognition. As boundaries are trespassed, a drop of up to 10% is observed for both Improved Dense Trajectories and Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network. We demonstrate that such disagreement stems from a limited understanding of the distinct phases of an action, and propose annotating based on the Rubicon Boundaries, inspired by a similarly named cognitive model, for consistent temporal bounds of object interactions. Evaluated on a public dataset, we report a 4% increase in overall accuracy, and an increase in accuracy for 55% of classes when Rubicon Boundaries are used for temporal annotations."}

During this process, it is usually intuitive for humans to choose an object as a proper container and to use an efficient pose to carry objects; yet, it is non-trivial for current computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose an approach to jointly infer container and human pose for transferring objects by minimizing the costs associated both object and pose candidates. Our approach predicts which object to choose as a container while reasoning about how humans interact with physical surroundings to accomplish the task of transferring objects given visual input. In the learning phase, the presented method learns how humans make rational choices of containers and poses for transferring different objects, as well as the physical quantities required by the transfer task (e.g., compatibility between container and containee, energy cost of carrying pose) via a structured learning approach. In the inference phase, given a scanned 3D scene with different object candidates and a dictionary of human poses, our approach infers the best object as a container together with human pose for transferring a given object."}

Our benchmark provides different perspectives of the world captured from airplanes, drones and cars driving around the city. Manually labeling such a large scale dataset is infeasible. Instead, we propose to utilize different sources of high-precision maps to create our ground truth. Towards this goal, we develop algorithms that allow us to align all data sources with the maps while requiring minimal human supervision. We have designed a wide variety of tasks including building height estimation (reconstruction), road centerline and curb extraction, building instance segmentation, building contour extraction (reorganization), semantic labeling and scene type classification (recognition). Our pilot study shows that most of these tasks are still difficult for modern convolutional neural networks."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2017", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "SubUNets", "Title": "End-To-End Hand Shape and Continuous Sign Language Recognition", "Abstract": "We propose a novel deep learning approach to solve simultaneous alignment and recognition problems (referred to as \"Sequence-to-sequence\" learning). We decompose the problem into a series of specialised expert systems referred to as SubUNets. The spatio-temporal relationships between these SubUNets are then modelled to solve the task, while remaining trainable end-to-end. The approach mimics human learning and educational techniques, and has a number of significant advantages. SubUNets allow us to inject domain-specific expert knowledge into the system regarding suitable intermediate representations. They also allow us to implicitly perform transfer learning between different interrelated tasks, which also allows us to exploit a wider range of more varied data sources. In our experiments we demonstrate that each of these properties serves to significantly improve the performance of the overarching recognition system, by better constraining the learning problem. The proposed techniques are demonstrated in the challenging domain of sign language recognition. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on hand-shape recognition outperforming previous techniques by more than 30%). Furthermore, we are able to obtain comparable sign recognition rates to previous research, without the need for an alignment step to segment out the signs for recognition."}

Our core idea is to simultaneously optimize for geometry encoded in a signed distance field (SDF), textures from automatically-selected keyframes, and their camera poses along with material and scene lighting. To this end, we propose a joint surface reconstruction approach that is based on Shape-from-Shading (SfS) techniques and utilizes the estimation of spatially-varying spherical harmonics (SVSH) from subvolumes of the reconstructed scene. Through extensive examples and evaluations, we demonstrate that our method dramatically increases the level of detail in the reconstructed scene geometry and contributes highly to consistent surface texture recovery."}

Variational (deep) auto-encoders (VAE) have shown great results in unsupervised extraction of hierarchical latent representations from large amounts of image data, while being robust to noise and other undesired artifacts. Potentially, this makes VAEs a suitable approach for learning facial features for AU intensity estimation. Yet, most existing VAE-based methods apply classifiers learned separately from the encoded features. By contrast, the non-parametric (probabilistic) approaches, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs), typically outperform their parametric counterparts, but cannot deal easily with large amounts of data. To this end, we propose a novel VAE semi-parametric modeling framework, named DeepCoder, which combines the modeling power of parametric (convolutional) and non-parametric (ordinal GPs) VAEs, for joint learning of (1) latent representations at multiple levels in a task hierarchy, and (2) classification of multiple ordinal outputs. We show on benchmark datasets for AU intensity estimation that the proposed DeepCoder outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, and related VAEs and deep learning models."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2017", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Low-Rank Tensor Completion", "Title": "A Pseudo-Bayesian Learning Approach", "Abstract": "Low rank tensor completion, which solves a linear inverse problem with the principle of parsimony, is a powerful technique used in many application domains in computer vision and pattern recognition. As a surrogate function of the matrix rank that is non-convex and discontinuous, the nuclear norm is often used instead to derive efficient algorithms for recovering missing information in matrices and higher order tensors. However, the nuclear norm is a loose approximation of the matrix rank, and what is more, the tensor nuclear norm is not guaranteed to be the tightest convex envelope of a multilinear rank. Alternative algorithms either require specifying/tuning several parameters (e.g., the tensor rank), and/or have a performance far from reaching the theoretical limit where the number of observed elements equals the degree of freedom in the unknown low-rank tensor. In this paper, we propose a pseudo-Bayesian approach, where a Bayesian-inspired cost function is adjusted using appropriate approximations that lead to desirable attributes including concavity and symmetry. Although deviating from the original Bayesian model, the resulting non-convex cost function is proved to have the ability to recover the true tensor with a low multilinear rank. A computational efficient algorithm is derived to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with state-of-the-art alternatives by conducting extensive experiments on both synthetic data and several visual data recovery tasks."}

It can be achieved by taking any descriptor learning architecture for learning a leading descriptor and augmenting the architecture with an additional network stream for learning a complementary descriptor. To enforce the complementary property, a new network layer, called data-dependent modulation (DDM) layer, is introduced for adaptively learning the augmented network stream with the emphasis on the training data that are not well handled by the leading stream. By optimizing the proposed joint loss function with late fusion, the obtained descriptors are complementary to each other and their fusion improves performance. Experiments on several problems and datasets show that the proposed method is simple yet effective, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."}

Despite being crucial for designing robust trackers, their influence is poorly explored in standard benchmarks due to weakly defined, biased and overlapping attribute annotations. In this paper we propose to go beyond pre-recorded benchmarks with post-hoc annotations by presenting an approach that utilizes omnidirectional videos to generate realistic, consistently annotated, short-term tracking scenarios with exactly parameterized motion patterns. We have created an evaluation system, constructed a fully annotated dataset of omnidirectional videos and generators for typical motion patterns. We provide an in-depth analysis of major tracking paradigms which is complementary to the standard benchmarks and confirms the expressiveness of our evaluation approach."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2017", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "The Pose Knows", "Title": "Video Forecasting by Generating Pose Futures", "Abstract": "Current approaches to video forecasting attempt to generate videos directly in pixel space using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). However, since these approaches try to model all the structure and scene dynamics at once, in unconstrained settings they often generate uninterpretable results. Our insight is that forecasting needs to be done first at a higher level of abstraction. Specifically, we exploit human pose detectors as a free source of supervision and break the video forecasting problem into two discrete steps. First we explicitly model the high level structure of active objects in the scene (humans) and use a VAE to model the possible future movements of humans in the pose space. We then use the future poses generated as conditional information to a GAN to predict the future frames of the video in pixel space. By using the structured space of pose as an intermediate representation, we sidestep the problems that GANs have in generating video pixels directly. We show through quantitative and qualitative evaluation that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for video prediction."}

Most approaches in industry focus on leveraging expensive sensors mounted on top of a fleet of cars. This results in very accurate estimates when using techniques that involve a user in the loop. However, these solutions are very expensive and have small coverage. In contrast, in this paper we propose an approach that directly estimates road topology from aerial images. This provides us with an affordable solution which has large coverage. Towards this goal, we take advantage of the latest developments in deep learning to have an initial segmentation of the aerial images. We then propose an algorithm that reasons about missing connections in the extracted road topology as a shortest path problem which can be solved efficiently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the challenging TorontoCity dataset and show very significant improvements over the state-of-the-art."}

SGNs employ a sequence of neural networks, each solving a sub-grouping problem of increasing semantic complexity in order to gradually compose objects out of pixels. In particular, the first network aims to group pixels along each image row and column by predicting horizontal and vertical object breakpoints. These breakpoints are then used to create line segments. By exploiting two-directional information, the second network groups horizontal and vertical lines into connected components. Finally, the third network groups the connected components into object instances. Our experiments show that our SGN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both, the Cityscapes dataset as well as PASCAL VOC."}

However, fast models are usually less accurate, while accurate models cannot satisfy our need for speed. A fast model can be 10 times faster but 50% less accurate than an accurate model. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Feeding (AF) to combine a fast (but less accurate) detector and an accurate (but slow) detector, by adaptively determining whether an image is easy or hard and choosing an appropriate detector for it. In practice, we build a cascade of detectors, including the AF classifier which make the easy vs. hard decision and the two detectors. The AF classifier can be tuned to obtain different tradeoff between speed and accuracy, which has negligible training time and requires no additional training data. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO and Caltech Pedestrian datasets confirm that AF has the ability to achieve comparable speed as the fast detector and comparable accuracy as the accurate one at the same time. As an example, by combining the fast SSD300 with the accurate SSD500 detector, AF leads to 50% speedup over SSD500 with the same precision on the VOC2007 test set."}

Most existing weakly-supervised methods localize only the most discriminative parts of an object rather than all relevant parts, which leads to suboptimal performance. Our key idea is to hide patches in a training image randomly, forcing the network to seek other relevant parts when the most discriminative part is hidden. Our approach only needs to modify the input image and can work with any network designed for object localization. During testing, we do not need to hide any patches. Our Hide-and-Seek approach obtains superior performance compared to previous methods for weakly-supervised object localization on the ILSVRC dataset. We also demonstrate that our framework can be easily extended to weakly-supervised action localization."}

However, the behavior of deep networks is yet to be fully understood and is still an active area of research. In this work, we present an intriguing behavior: pre-trained CNNs can be made to improve their predictions by structurally perturbing the input. We observe that these perturbations - referred as Guided Perturbations - enable a trained network to improve its prediction performance without any learning or change in network weights. We perform various ablative experiments to understand how these perturbations affect the local context and feature representations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this idea can improve performance of several existing approaches on semantic segmentation and scene labeling tasks on the PASCAL VOC dataset and supervised classification tasks on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets."}

In some cases, uncertainty is inherent in the task itself. In future prediction, for example, many distinct outcomes are equally valid. In other cases, uncertainty arises from the way data is labeled. For example, in object detection, many objects of interest often go unlabeled, and in human pose estimation, occluded joints are often labeled with ambiguous values. In this work we focus on a principled approach for handling such scenarios. In particular, we propose a framework for reformulating existing single-prediction models as multiple hypothesis prediction (MHP) models and an associated meta loss and optimization procedure to train them. To demonstrate our approach, we consider four diverse applications: human pose estimation, future prediction, image classification and segmentation. We find that MHP models outperform their single-hypothesis counterparts in all cases, and that MHP models simultaneously expose valuable insights into the variability of predictions."}

This is an important problem, as fast extraction of semantically important (e.g. human actions) segments from untrimmed videos is an important step for large-scale video analysis. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Temporal Unit Regression Network (TURN) model. There are two salient aspects of TURN: (1) TURN jointly predicts action proposals and refines the temporal boundaries by temporal coordinate regression with contextual information; (2) Fast computation is enabled by unit feature reuse: a long untrimmed video is decomposed into video units, which are reused as basic building blocks of temporal proposals. TURN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under average recall (AR) by a large margin on THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet datasets, and runs over 900 frames per second (FPS) on a TITAN X GPU.

Citycam videos have low resolution, low frame rate, high occlusion and large perspective, making most existing methods lose their efficacy. To overcome limitations of existing methods and incorporate the temporal information of traffic video, we design a novel FCN-rLSTM network to jointly estimate vehicle density and vehicle count by connecting fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) with long short term memory networks (LSTM) in a residual learning fashion. Such design leverages the strengths of FCN for pixel-level prediction and the strengths of LSTM for learning complex temporal dynamics. The residual learning connection reformulates the vehicle count regression as learning residual functions with reference to the sum of densities in each frame, which significantly accelerates the training of networks. To preserve feature map resolution, we propose a Hyper-Atrous combination to integrate atrous convolution in FCN and combine feature maps of different convolution layers. FCN-rLSTM enables refined feature representation and a novel end-to-end trainable mapping from pixels to vehicle count. We extensively evaluated the proposed method on different counting tasks with three datasets, with experimental results demonstrating their effectiveness and robustness. In particular, FCN-rLSTM reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) from 5.31 to 4.21 on TRANCOS; and reduces the MAE from 2.74 to 1.53 on WebCamT. Training process is accelerated by 5 times on average."}

Second, we run a user study to understand the privacy preferences of different users w.r.t. such attributes. Third, we propose models that predict user specific privacy score from images in order to enforce the users' privacy preferences. Our model is trained to predict the user specific privacy risk and even outperforms the judgment of the users, who often fail to follow their own privacy preferences on image data."}

To this end, we combine a convolutional encoder network with an expert-designed generative model that serves as decoder. The core innovation is the differentiable parametric decoder that encapsulates image formation analytically based on a generative model. Our decoder takes as input a code vector with exactly defined semantic meaning that encodes detailed face pose, shape, expression, skin reflectance and scene illumination. Due to this new way of combining CNN-based with model-based face reconstruction, the CNN-based encoder learns to extract semantically meaningful parameters from a single monocular input image. For the first time, a CNN encoder and an expert-designed generative model can be trained end-to-end in an unsupervised manner, which renders training on very large (unlabeled) real world data feasible. The obtained reconstructions compare favorably to current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quality and richness of representation."}

However, previous works mainly utilize video-level category as supervision to train RNNs, which may prohibit RNNs to learn complex motion structures along time. In this paper, we propose a recurrent pose-attention network (RPAN) to address this challenge, where we introduce a novel pose-attention mechanism to adaptively learn pose-related features at every time-step action prediction of RNNs. More specifically, we make three main contributions in this paper. Firstly, unlike previous works on pose-related action recognition, our RPAN is an end-to-end recurrent network which can exploit important spatial-temporal evolutions of human pose to assist action recognition in a unified framework. Secondly, instead of learning individual human-joint features separately, our pose-attention mechanism learns robust human-part features by sharing attention parameters partially on the semantically-related human joints. These human-part features are then fed into the human-part pooling layer to construct a highly-discriminative pose-related representation for temporal action modeling. Thirdly, one important byproduct of our RPAN is pose estimation in videos, which can be used for coarse pose annotation in action videos. We evaluate the proposed RPAN quantitatively and qualitatively on two popular benchmarks, i.e., Sub-JHMDB and PennAction. Experimental results show that RPAN outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on these challenging datasets."}

We first use segmentation to detect the objects of interest in 2D even in presence of partial occlusions and cluttered background. By contrast with recent patch-based methods, we rely on a \"holistic\" approach: We apply to the detected objects a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to predict their 3D poses in the form of 2D projections of the corners of their 3D bounding boxes. This, however, is not sufficient for handling objects from the recent T-LESS dataset: These objects exhibit an axis of rotational symmetry, and the similarity of two images of such an object under two different poses makes training the CNN challenging. We solve this problem by restricting the range of poses used for training, and by introducing a classifier to identify the range of a pose at run-time before estimating it. We also use an optional additional step that refines the predicted poses. We improve the state-of-the-art on the LINEMOD dataset from 73.7% to 89.3% of correctly registered RGB frames. We are also the first to report results on the Occlusion dataset using color images only. We obtain 54% of frames passing the Pose 6D criterion on average on several sequences of the T-LESS dataset, compared to the 67% of the state-of-the-art on the same sequences which uses both color and depth. The full approach is also scalable, as a single network can be trained for multiple objects simultaneously."}

It jointly optimizes for all the model parameters within the active window, including the intrinsic/extrinsic camera parameters of all keyframes and the depth values of all selected pixels. In particular, we propose a novel approach to integrate constraints from static stereo into the bundle adjustment pipeline of temporal multi-view stereo. Real-time optimization is realized by sampling pixels uniformly from image regions with sufficient intensity gradient. Fixed-baseline stereo resolves scale drift. It also reduces the sensitivities to large optical flow and to rolling shutter effect which are known shortcomings of direct image alignment methods. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the proposed Stereo DSO outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual odometry methods both in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness. Moreover, our method delivers a more precise metric 3D reconstruction than previous dense/semi-dense direct approaches while providing a higher reconstruction density than feature-based methods."}

However, this semantic meaning of landmark points is often lost in 2D approaches where landmarks are either moved to visible boundaries or ignored as the pose of the face changes. In order to extract consistent alignment points across large poses, the 3D structure of the face must be considered in the alignment step. However, extracting a 3D structure from a single 2D image usually requires alignment in the first place. We present our novel approach to simultaneously extract the 3D shape of the face and the semantically consistent 2D alignment through a 3D Spatial Transformer Network (3DSTN) to model both the camera projection matrix and the warping parameters of a 3D model. By utilizing a generic 3D model and a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) warping function, we are able to generate subject specific 3D shapes without the need for a large 3D shape basis. In addition, our proposed network can be trained in an end-to-end framework on entirely synthetic data from the 300W-LP dataset. Unlike other 3D methods, our approach only requires one pass through the network resulting in a faster than real-time alignment. Evaluations of our model on the Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild (AFLW) and AFLW2000-3D datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance over other 3D approaches to alignment."}

In this paper we wish to extend the scientific scope of appearance-based puzzle solving and consider \"brick wall\" jigsaw puzzles - rectangular pieces who may have different sizes, and could be placed next to each other at arbitrary offset along their abutting edge -- a more explicit configuration with propertie of real world puzzles. We present the new challenges that arise in brick wall puzzles and address them in two stages. First we concentrate on the reconstruction of the puzzle (with or without missing pieces) assuming an oracle for offset assignments. We show that despite the increased complexity of the problem, under these conditions performance can be made comparable to the state-of-the-art in solving the simpler square piece puzzles, and thereby argue that solving brick wall puzzles may be reduced to finding the correct offset between two neighboring pieces. We then move on to focus on implementing the oracle computationally using a mixture of dissimilarity metrics and correlation matching. We show results on various brick wall puzzles and discuss how our work may start a new research path for the puzzle solving community."}

Although training such deep saliency models can significantly improve the detection performance, it requires large-scale manual supervision in the form of pixel-level human annotation, which is highly labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this problem, this paper makes the earliest effort to train a deep salient object detector without using any human annotation. The key insight is \"supervision by fusion\", i.e., generating useful supervisory signals from the fusion process of weak but fast unsupervised saliency models. Based on this insight, we combine an intra-image fusion stream and a inter-image fusion stream in the proposed framework to generate the learning curriculum and pseudo ground-truth for supervising the training of the deep salient object detector. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can approach the same network trained with full supervision (within 2-5% performance gap) and, more encouragingly, even outperform a number of fully supervised state-of-the-art approaches."}

Most of the traditional textual-visual binary encoding methods only consider holistic image representations and fail to model descriptive sentences. This renders existing methods inappropriate to handle the rich semantics of informative cross-modal data for quality textual-visual search tasks. To address the problem of hashing cross-modal data with semantic-rich cues, in this paper, a novel integrated deep architecture is developed to effectively encode the detailed semantics of informative images and long descriptive sentences, named as Textual-Visual Deep Binaries (TVDB). In particular, region-based convolutional networks with long short-term memory units are introduced to fully explore image regional details while semantic cues of sentences are modeled by a text convolutional network. Additionally, we propose a stochastic batch-wise training routine, where high-quality binary codes and deep encoding functions are efficiently optimized in an alternating manner. Experiments are conducted on three multimedia datasets, i.e. Microsoft COCO, IAPR TC-12, and INRIA Web Queries, where the proposed TVDB model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art binary coding methods in the task of cross-modal retrieval."}

Although R-FCN has achieved higher detection speed while keeping the detection performance, the global structure information is ignored by the position-sensitive score maps. To fully explore the local and global properties, in this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional network, named as CoupleNet, to couple the global structure with local parts for object detection. Specifically, the object proposals obtained by the Region Proposal Network (RPN) are fed into the the coupling module which consists of two branches. One branch adopts the position-sensitive RoI (PSRoI) pooling to capture the local part information of the object, while the other employs the RoI pooling to encode the global and context information. Next, we design different coupling strategies and normalization ways to make full use of the complementary advantages between the global and local branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We achieve state-of-the-art results on all three challenging datasets, i.e. a mAP of 82.7% on VOC07, 80.4% on VOC12, and 34.4% on COCO.Codes will be made publicly available."}

This is primarily due to the deficiencies in the generated word distribution, vocabulary size, and strong bias in the generators towards frequent captions. Furthermore, humans -- rightfully so -- generate multiple, diverse captions, due to the inherent ambiguity in the captioning task which is not explicitly considered in today's systems. To address these challenges, we change the training objective of the caption generator from reproducing ground-truth captions to generating a set of captions that is indistinguishable from human written captions. Instead of handcrafting such a learning target, we employ adversarial training in combination with an approximate Gumbel sampler to implicitly match the generated distribution to the human one. While our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art in terms of the correctness of the captions, we generate a set of diverse captions that are significantly less biased and better match the global uni-, bi- and tri-gram distributions of the human captions."}

Fashion styles emerge organically from how people assemble outfits of clothing, making them difficult to pin down with a computational model. Low-level visual similarity can be too specific to detect stylistically similar images, while manually crafted style categories can be too abstract to capture subtle style differences. We propose an unsupervised approach to learn a style-coherent representation. Our method leverages probabilistic polylingual topic models based on visual attributes to discover a set of latent style factors. Given a collection of unlabeled fashion images, our approach mines for the latent styles, then summarizes outfits by how they mix those styles. Our approach can organize galleries of outfits by style without requiring any style labels. Experiments on over 100K images demonstrate its promise for retrieving, mixing, and summarizing fashion images by their style."}

This is motivated by the fact that it is extremely expensive to label the combinatorial relations between objects at the instance level. Compared to the extensively studied problem, Weakly Supervised Object Detection (WSOD), WSVRD is more challenging as it needs to examine a large set of regions pairs, which is computationally prohibitive and more likely stuck in a local optimal solution such as those involving wrong spatial context. To this end, we present a Parallel, Pairwise Region-based, Fully Convolutional Network (PPR-FCN) for WSVRD. It uses a parallel FCN architecture that simultaneously performs pair selection and classification of single regions and region pairs for object and relation detection, while sharing almost all computation shared over the entire image. In particular, we propose a novel position-role-sensitive score map with pairwise RoI pooling to efficiently capture the crucial context associated with a pair of objects. We demonstrate the superiority of PPR-FCN over all baselines in solving the WSVRD challenge by using results of extensive experiments over two visual relation benchmarks."}

As geometric objects, subspaces have also been successfully used for efficiently representing certain types of invariant data. However, methods for subspace learning from subspace-valued data have been notably absent due to incompatibilities with standard problem formulations. To fill this void, we introduce Approximate Grassmannian Intersections (AGI), a novel geometric interpretation of subspace learning posed as finding the approximate intersection of constraint sets on a Grassmann manifold. Our approach can naturally be applied to input subspaces of varying dimension while reducing to standard subspace learning in the case of vector-valued data. Despite the nonconvexity of our problem, its globally-optimal solution can be found using a singular value decomposition. Furthermore, we also propose an efficient, general optimization approach that can incorporate additional constraints to encourage properties such as robustness. Alongside standard subspace applications, AGI also enables the novel task of transfer learning via subspace completion. We evaluate our approach on a variety of applications, demonstrating improved invariance and generalization over vector-valued alternatives."}

Even though RPCA has been shown to be very successful in solving many rank minimisation problems, there are still cases where degenerate or suboptimal solutions are obtained. This is likely to be remedied by taking into account of domain-dependent prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose two models for the RPCA problem with the aid of side information on the low-rank structure of the data. The versatility of the proposed methods is demonstrated by applying them to four applications, namely background subtraction, facial image denoising, face and facial expression recognition. Experimental results on synthetic and five real world datasets indicate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed methods on these application domains, largely outperforming six previous approaches."}

However, learning in traditional neural networks (NNs) only tries to find a model with fixed parameters that optimize the average behavior over all inputs, without using data-specific properties. In this paper, we develop a meta-level NN (MLNN) model that learns meta-knowledge on data-specific properties of images during learning and that dynamically adapts its weights during application according to the properties of the images input. MLNN consists of two parts: the dynamic supplementary NN (SNN) that learns meta-information on each type of inputs, and the fixed base-level NN (BLNN) that incorporates the meta-information from SNN into its weights at run time to realize the generalization for each type of inputs. We verify our approach using over ten network architectures under various application scenarios and loss functions. In low-level vision applications on image super-resolution and denoising, MLNN has 0.1 0.3 dB improvements on PSNR, whereas for high-level image classification, MLNN has accuracy improvement of 0.4 0.6% for Cifar10 and 1.2 2.1% for ImageNet when compared to convolutional NNs (CNNs).

Learning such mappings from unlabelled data, or improving upon supervised models by exploiting unlabelled data, remains elusive. We argue that there are two important parts to learning without annotations: (i) matching the predictions to the input observations, and (ii) matching the predictions to known priors. We propose Adversarial Inverse Graphics networks (AIGNs): weakly supervised neural network models that combine feedback from rendering their predictions, with distribution matching between their predictions and a collection of ground-truth factors. We apply AIGNs to 3D human pose estimation and 3D structure and egomotion estimation, and outperform models supervised by only paired annotations. We further apply AIGNs to facial image transformation using super-resolution and inpainting renderers, while deliberately adding biases in the ground-truth datasets. Our model seamlessly incorporates such biases, rendering input faces towards young, old, feminine, masculine or Tom Cruise-like equivalents (depending on the chosen bias), or adding lip and nose augmentations while inpainting concealed lips and noses."}

With this paper we radically depart from current practice, and take a first step towards the design and implementation of a deep network architecture able to classify and regress whole video subsets, so providing a truly optimal solution of the action detection problem. In this work, in particular, we propose a novel deep net framework able to regress and classify 3D region proposals spanning two successive video frames, whose core is an evolution of classical region proposal networks (RPNs). As such, our 3D-RPN net is able to effectively encode the temporal aspect of actions by purely exploiting appearance, as opposed to methods which heavily rely on expensive flow maps. The proposed model is end-to-end trainable and can be jointly optimised for action localisation and classification in a single step. At test time the network predicts \"micro-tubes\" encompassing two successive frames, which are linked up into complete action tubes via a new algorithm which exploits the temporal encoding learned by the network and cuts computation time by 50%. Promising results on the J-HMDB-21 and UCF-101 action detection datasets show that our model does outperform the state-of-the-art when relying purely on appearance."}

In other words, we use methods inspired from computer vision and machine learning to search for words in large collections of digitized manuscripts. In particular, we are interested in historical handwritten texts, which are often far more challenging than modern printed documents. This task is important, as it provides people with a way to quickly find what they are looking for in large collections that are tedious and difficult to read manually. To this end, we introduce an end-to-end trainable model based on deep neural networks that we call Ctrl-F-Net. Given a full manuscript page, the model simultaneously generates region proposals, and embeds these into a distributed word embedding space, where searches are performed. We evaluate the model on common benchmarks for handwritten word spotting, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art segmentation-free approaches by a large margin, and in some cases even segmentation-based approaches. One interesting real-life application of our approach is to help historians to find and count specific words in court records that are related to women's sustenance activities and division of labor.

Traditionally, the performance of algorithms for this task is measured using pixel-wise reconstruction measures such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) which have been shown to correlate poorly with the human perception of image quality. As a result, algorithms minimizing these metrics tend to produce over-smoothed images that lack high-frequency textures and do not look natural despite yielding high PSNR values. We propose a novel application of automated texture synthesis in combination with a perceptual loss focusing on creating realistic textures rather than optimizing for a pixel-accurate reproduction of ground truth images during training. By using feed-forward fully convolutional neural networks in an adversarial training setting, we achieve a significant boost in image quality at high magnification ratios. Extensive experiments on a number of datasets show the effectiveness of our approach, yielding state-of-the-art results in both quantitative and qualitative benchmarks."}

CRN maps the edited portrait images back to the original ones without knowing beautification operation details. Our experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the system for this novel task."}

While variations due to scale and rotation have been examined, there is a lack of practical solutions for more complex deformations such as affine transformations because of the tremendous size of the associated solution space. To address this problem, we present a discrete-continuous transformation matching (DCTM) framework where dense affine transformation fields are inferred through a discrete label optimization in which the labels are iteratively updated via continuous regularization. In this way, our approach draws solutions from the continuous space of affine transformations in a manner that can be computed efficiently through constant-time edge-aware filtering and a proposed affine-varying CNN-based descriptor. Experimental results show that this model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for dense semantic correspondence on various benchmarks."}

However, as the depth grows, the long-term dependency problem is rarely realized for these very deep models, which results in the prior states/layers having little influence on the subsequent ones. Motivated by the fact that human thoughts have persistency, we propose a very deep persistent memory network (MemNet) that introduces a memory block, consisting of a recursive unit and a gate unit, to explicitly mine persistent memory through an adaptive learning process. The recursive unit learns multi-level representations of the current state under different receptive fields. The representations and the outputs from the previous memory blocks are concatenated and sent to the gate unit, which adaptively controls how much of the previous states should be reserved, and decides how much of the current state should be stored. We apply MemNet to three image restoration tasks, i.e., image denosing, super-resolution and JPEG deblocking. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the necessity of the MemNet and its unanimous superiority on all three tasks over the state of the arts.

Behavioral vision studies, however, have shown that the human visual system is highly sensitive to structures in scenes. Here, we propose a novel, efficient, and easy to calculate measure known an structural similarity measure (Structure-measure) to evaluate non-binary foreground maps.

This operator, called Unrolled-Memory-Inner-Product (UMI), is a computationally-efficient operator with smaller code token requirement. Since a naive UMI implementation would increase memory requirement through input data unrolling, we propose a method to achieve optimal memory fetch performance in modern GPUs.

While many approaches exist to perform reconstruction, few of them take an active role in deciding where the next observations should come from. Furthermore, the problem of travelling from the camera's current position to the next, known as pathplanning, usually focuses on minimising path length. This approach is ill-suited for reconstruction applications, where learning about the environment is more valuable than speed of traversal. We present a novel Scenic Route Planner that selects paths which maximise information gain, both in terms of total map coverage and reconstruction accuracy. We also introduce a new type of collaborative behaviour into the planning stage called opportunistic collaboration, which allows sensors to switch between acting as independent Structure from Motion (SfM) agents or as a variable baseline stereo pair. We show that Scenic Planning enables similar performance to state-of-the-art batch approaches using less than 0.00027% of the possible stereo pairs (3% of the views). Comparison against length-based pathplanning approaches show that our approach produces more complete and more accurate maps with fewer frames. Finally, we demonstrate the Scenic Pathplanner's ability to generalise to live scenarios by mounting cameras on autonomous ground-based sensor platforms and exploring an environment."}

The graph can be tuned to favor reconstruction quality or speed and is continuously smoothed and augmented as the camera explores the scene. Unlike keyframe-based approaches, the optimized surface is always available at the current pose, which is necessary for low-latency obstacle avoidance. FLaME (Fast Lightweight Mesh Estimation) can generate mesh reconstructions at upwards of 230 Hz using less than one Intel i7 CPU core, which enables operation on size, weight, and power-constrained platforms.

Current multi-exposure fusion (MEF) approaches use hand-crafted features to fuse input sequence. However, the weak hand-crafted representations are not robust to varying input conditions. Moreover, they perform poorly for extreme exposure image pairs. Thus, it is highly desirable to have a method that is robust to varying input conditions and capable of handling extreme exposure without artifacts. Deep representations have known to be robust to input conditions and have shown phenomenal performance in a supervised setting. However, the stumbling block in using deep learning for MEF was the lack of sufficient training data and an oracle to provide the ground-truth for supervision. To address the above issues, we have gathered a large dataset of multi-exposure image stacks for training and to circumvent the need for ground truth images, we propose an unsupervised deep learning framework for MEF utilizing a no-reference quality metric as loss function. The proposed approach uses a novel CNN architecture trained to learn the fusion operation without reference ground truth image. The model fuses a set of common low level features extracted from each image to generate artifact-free perceptually pleasing results. We perform extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation and show that the proposed technique outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for a variety of natural images."}

It is designed based on a re-formulated atmospheric scattering model. Instead of estimating the transmission matrix and the atmospheric light separately as most previous models did, AOD-Net directly generates the clean image through a light-weight CNN. Such a novel end-to-end design makes it easy to embed AOD-Net into other deep models, e.g., Faster R-CNN, for improving high-level tasks on hazy images. Experimental results on both synthesized and natural hazy image datasets demonstrate our superior performance than the state-of-the-art in terms of PSNR, SSIM and the subjective visual quality. Furthermore, when concatenating AOD-Net with Faster R-CNN, we witness a large improvement of the object detection performance on hazy images."}

Prior works break the problem into two sub-tasks: semantic segmentation of floor, walls, ceiling to produce layout hypotheses, followed by an iterative optimization step to rank these hypotheses. In contrast, we adopt a more direct formulation of this problem as one of estimating an ordered set of room layout keypoints. The room layout and the corresponding segmentation is completely specified given the locations of these ordered keypoints. We predict the locations of the room layout keypoints using RoomNet, an end-to-end trainable encoder-decoder network. On the challenging benchmark datasets Hedau and LSUN, we achieve state-of-the-art performance along with 200x to 600x speedup compared to the most recent work. Additionally, we present optional extensions to the RoomNet architecture such as including recurrent computations and memory units to refine the keypoint locations under the same parametric capacity."}

Unlike two stage proposal-classification detectors, SSH detects faces in a single stage directly from the early convolutional layers in a classification network. SSH is headless. That is, it is able to achieve state-of-the-art results while removing the \"head\" of its underlying classification network -- i.e. all fully connected layers in the VGG-16 which contains a large number of parameters. Additionally, instead of relying on an image pyramid to detect faces with various scales, SSH is scale-invariant by design. We simultaneously detect faces with different scales in a single forward pass of the network, but from different layers. These properties make SSH fast and light-weight. Surprisingly, with a headless VGG-16, SSH beats the ResNet-101-based state-of-the-art on the WIDER dataset. Even though, unlike the current state-of-the-art, SSH does not use an image pyramid and is 5X faster. Moreover, if an image pyramid is deployed, our light-weight network achieves state-of-the-art on all subsets of the WIDER dataset, improving the AP by 2.5%. SSH also reaches state-of-the-art results on the FDDB and Pascal-Faces datasets while using a small input size, leading to a speed of 50 frames/second on a GPU."}

Once the codebooks are learned, these schemes encode descriptors independently. In contrast to that, we present a new coding scheme that arranges dataset descriptors into a set of arborescence graphs, and then encodes non-root descriptors by quantizing their displacements with respect to their parent nodes. By optimizing the structure of arborescences, our coding scheme can decrease the quantization error considerably, while incurring only minimal overhead on the memory footprint and the speed of nearest neighbor search in the compressed dataset compared to the independent quantization. The advantage of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in a series of experiments with datasets of SIFT and deep descriptors."}

Among these elements, character is the most basic one for various languages such as Western, Chinese, Japanese, mathematical expression and etc. It is natural and convenient to construct a common text detection engine based on character detectors. However, training character detectors requires a vast of location annotated characters, which are expensive to obtain. Actually, the existing real text datasets are mostly annotated in word or line level. To remedy this dilemma, we propose a weakly supervised framework that can utilize word annotations, either in tight quadrangles or the more loose bounding boxes, for character detector training. When applied in scene text detection, we are thus able to train a robust character detector by exploiting word annotations in the rich large-scale real scene text datasets, e.g. ICDAR15 [??] and COCO-text [??]. The character detector acts as a key role in the pipeline of our text detection engine. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several challenging scene text detection benchmarks. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our pipeline by various scenarios, including deformed text detection and math expression recognition."}

However, previous studies have not fully exploited the potentials of multi-modal feature fusion, e.g., simply concatenating RGB and depth features or averaging RGB and depth score maps. To learn the optimal fusion of multi-modal features, this paper presents a novel network that extends the core idea of residual learning to RGB-D semantic segmentation. Our network effectively captures multi-level RGB-D CNN features by including multi-modal feature fusion blocks and multi-level feature refinement blocks. Feature fusion blocks learn residual RGB and depth features and their combinations to fully exploit the complementary characteristics of RGB and depth data. Feature refinement blocks learn the combination of fused features from multiple levels to enable high-resolution prediction. Our network can efficiently train discriminative multi-level features from each modality end-to-end by taking full advantage of skip-connections. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging RGB-D indoor datasets, NYUDv2 and SUN RGB-D."}

We focus on the filter level pruning, i.e., the whole filter would be discarded if it is less important. Our method does not change the original network structure, thus it can be perfectly supported by any off-the-shelf deep learning libraries. We formally establish filter pruning as an optimization problem, and reveal that we need to prune filters based on statistics information computed from its next layer, not the current layer, which differentiates ThiNet from existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy, which has advanced the state-of-the-art. We also show the performance of ThiNet on ILSVRC-12 benchmark. ThiNet achieves 3.31x FLOPs reduction and 16.63x compression on VGG-16, with only 0.52% top-5 accuracy drop. Similar experiments with ResNet-50 reveal that even for a compact network, ThiNet can also reduce more than half of the parameters and FLOPs, at the cost of roughly 1% top-5 accuracy drop. Moreover, the original VGG-16 model can be further pruned into a very small model with only 5.05MB model size, preserving AlexNet level accuracy but showing much stronger generalization ability."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2017", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "AutoDIAL", "Title": "Automatic DomaIn Alignment Layers", "Abstract": "Classifiers trained on given databases perform poorly when tested on data acquired in different settings. This is explained in domain adaptation through a shift among distributions of the source and target domains. Attempts to align them have traditionally resulted in works reducing the domain shift by introducing appropriate loss terms, measuring the discrepancies between source and target distributions, in the objective function. Here we take a different route, proposing to align the learned representations by embedding in any given network specific Domain Alignment Layers, designed to match the source and target feature distributions to a reference one. Opposite to previous works which define a priori in which layers adaptation should be performed, our method is able to automatically learn the degree of feature alignment required at different levels of the deep network. Thorough experiments on different public benchmarks, in the unsupervised setting, confirm the power of our approach."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2017", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Focusing Attention", "Title": "Towards Accurate Text Recognition in Natural Images", "Abstract": "Scene text recognition has been a hot research topic in computer vision due to its various applications. The state of the art is the attention-based encoder-decoder framework that learns the mapping between input images and output sequences in a purely data-driven way. However, we observe that existing attention-based methods perform poorly on complicated and/or low-quality images. One major reason is that existing methods cannot get accurate alignments between feature areas and targets for such images. We call this phenomenon \"attention drift\". To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose the FAN (the abbreviation of Focusing Attention Network) method that employs a focusing attention mechanism to automatically draw back the drifted attention. FAN consists of two major components: an attention network (AN) that is responsible for recognizing character targets as in the existing methods, and a focusing network (FN) that is responsible for adjusting attention by evaluating whether AN pays attention properly on the target areas in the images. Furthermore, different from the existing methods, we adopt a ResNet-based network to enrich deep representations of scene text images. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including the IIIT5k, SVT and ICDAR datasets, show that the FAN method substantially outperforms the existing methods."}

This is important because the output of many computer vision tasks, including image tagging and object detection, are naturally expressed as sets of entities rather than vectors. As opposed to a vector, the size of a set is not fixed in advance, and it is invariant to the ordering of entities within it. We define a likelihood for a set distribution and learn its parameters using a deep neural network. We also derive a loss for predicting a discrete distribution corresponding to set cardinality. Set prediction is demonstrated on the problem of multi-class image classification. Moreover, we show that the proposed cardinality loss can also trivially be applied to the tasks of object counting and pedestrian detection. Our approach outperforms existing methods in all three cases on standard datasets."}

Existing methods typically involve training classifiers for a pre-defined list of actions and applying the classifiers in a sliding window fashion. However, activities in the wild consist of a wide combination of actors, actions and objects; it is difficult to design a proper activity list that meets users' needs. We propose to localize activities by natural language queries. Temporal Activity Localization via Language (TALL) is challenging as it requires: (1) suitable design of text and video representations to allow cross-modal matching of actions and language queries; (2) ability to locate actions accurately given features from sliding windows of limited granularity. We propose a novel Cross-modal Temporal Regression Localizer (CTRL) to jointly model text query and video clips, output alignment scores and location regression results for candidate clips. For evaluation, we adopt TaCoS dataset, and build a new dataset for this task on top of Charades by adding sentence temporal annotations, called Charades-STA. Experimental results show that CTRL outperforms previous methods significantly on both datasets."}

We incorporate domain-specific knowledge to design our PanNet architecture by focusing on the two aims of the pan-sharpening problem: spectral and spatial preservation. For spectral preservation, we add up-sampled multispectral images to the network output, which directly propagates the spectral information to the reconstructed image. To preserve spatial structure, we train our network parameters in the high-pass filtering domain rather than the image domain. We show that the trained network generalizes well to images from different satellites without needing retraining. Experiments show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods visually and in terms of standard quality metrics."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2017", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Parallel Tracking and Verifying", "Title": "A Framework for Real-Time and High Accuracy Visual Tracking", "Abstract": "Being intensively studied, visual tracking has seen great recent advances in either speed (e.g., with correlation filters) or accuracy (e.g., with deep features). Real-time and high accuracy tracking algorithms, however, remain scarce. In this paper we study the problem from a new perspective and present a novel parallel tracking and verifying (PTAV) framework, by taking advantage of the ubiquity of multi-thread techniques and borrowing from the success of parallel tracking and mapping in visual SLAM. Our PTAV framework typically consists of two components, a tracker T and a verifier V, working in parallel on two separate threads. The tracker T aims to provide a super real-time tracking inference and is expected to perform well most of the time; by contrast, the verifier V checks the tracking results and corrects T when needed. The key innovation is that, V does not work on every frame but only upon the requests from T; on the other end, T may adjust the tracking according to the feedback from V. With such collaboration, PTAV enjoys both the high efficiency provided by T and the strong discriminative power by V. In our extensive experiments on popular benchmarks including OTB2013, OTB2015, TC128 and UAV20L, PTAV achieves the best tracking accuracy among all real-time trackers, and in fact performs even better than many deep learning based solutions. Moreover, as a general framework, PTAV is very flexible and has great rooms for improvement and generalization."}

One of the most widely-used methods is the Kalman filter, which is both extremely simple and general. However, Kalman filters require a motion model and measurement model to be specified a priori, which burdens the modeler and simultaneously demands that we use explicit models that are often only crude approximations of reality. For example, in the pose-estimation tasks mentioned above, it is common to use motion models that assume constant velocity or constant acceleration, and we believe that these simplified representations are severely inhibitive. In this work, we propose to instead learn rich, dynamic representations of the motion and noise models. In particular, we propose learning these models from data using long short-term memory, which allows representations that depend on all previous observations and all previous states. We evaluate our method using three of the most popular pose estimation tasks in computer vision, and in all cases we obtain state-of-the-art performance."}

Not only is the number of possible comparisons quadratic in the number of training images, but also access to images adequately spanning the space of fine-grained visual differences is limited. We propose to overcome the sparsity of supervision problem via synthetically generated images. Building on a state-of-the-art image generation engine, we sample pairs of training images exhibiting slight modifications of individual attributes. Augmenting real training image pairs with these examples, we then train attribute ranking models to predict the relative strength of an attribute in novel pairs of real images. Our results on datasets of faces and fashion images show the great promise of bootstrapping imperfect image generators to counteract sample sparsity for learning to rank."}

Deep learning to hash, which improves retrieval quality by end-to-end representation learning and hash encoding, has received increasing attention recently. Subject to the ill-posed gradient difficulty in the optimization with sign activations, existing deep learning to hash methods need to first learn continuous representations and then generate binary hash codes in a separated binarization step, which suffer from substantial loss of retrieval quality. This work presents HashNet, a novel deep architecture for deep learning to hash by continuation method with convergence guarantees, which learns exactly binary hash codes from imbalanced similarity data. The key idea is to attack the ill-posed gradient problem in optimizing deep networks with non-smooth binary activations by continuation method, in which we begin from learning an easier network with smoothed activation function and let it evolve during the training, until it eventually goes back to being the original, difficult to optimize, deep network with the sign activation function. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that HashNet can generate exactly binary hash codes and yield state-of-the-art multimedia retrieval performance on standard benchmarks."}

We show that early layers do not necessarily need to be learned, providing the best results to-date with pre-defined representations while being competitive with Deep CNNs. Using a shallow cascade of 1x1 convolutions, which encodes scattering coefficients that correspond to spatial windows of very small sizes, permits to obtain AlexNet accuracy on the imagenet ILSVRC2012. We demonstrate that this local encoding explicitly learns invariance w.r.t. rotations. Combining scattering networks with a modern ResNet, we achieve a single-crop top 5 error of 11.4% on imagenet ILSVRC2012, comparable to the Resnet-18 architecture, while utilizing only 10 layers. We also find that hybrid architectures can yield excellent performance in the small sample regime, exceeding their end-to-end counterparts, through their ability to incorporate geometrical priors. We demonstrate this on subsets of the CIFAR-10 dataset and on the STL-10 dataset."}

There is another better way that combines the image and relevant song to amplify the expression, which has drawn much attention in the social network recently. Hence, the automatic selection of songs should be expected. In this paper, we propose to retrieve semantic relevant songs just by an image query, which is named as the image2song problem. Motivated by the requirements of establishing correlation in semantic/content, we build a semantic-based song retrieval framework, which learns the correlation between image content and lyric words. This model uses a convolutional neural network to generate rich tags from image regions, a recurrent neural network to model lyric, and then establishes correlation via a multi-layer perceptron. To reduce the content gap between image and lyric, we propose to make the lyric modeling focus on the main image content via a tag attention. We collect a dataset from the social-sharing multimodal data to study the proposed problem, which consists of (image, music clip, lyric) triplets. We demonstrate that our proposed model shows noticeable results in the image2song retrieval task and provides suitable songs. Besides, the song2image task is also performed."}

Existing learning based approaches model shape correspondence as a labelling problem, where each point of a query shape receives a label identifying a point on some reference domain; the correspondence is then constructed a posteriori by composing the label predictions of two input shapes. We propose a paradigm shift and design a structured prediction model in the space of functional maps, linear operators that provide a compact representation of the correspondence. We model the learning process via a deep residual network which takes dense descriptor fields defined on two shapes as input, and outputs a soft map between the two given objects. The resulting correspondence is shown to be accurate on several challenging benchmarks comprising multiple categories, synthetic models, real scans with acquisition artifacts, topological noise, and partiality."}

Most existing approaches utilize hand-crafted features for each modality independently and combine them in a heuristic manner. They often fail to consider the consistency and complementary information among features adequately, which makes them difficult to capture high-level semantic structures. The features learned by most of the current deep learning methods can obtain high-quality image classification results. However, these methods are hard to be applied to recognize 3D point clouds due to unorganized distribution and various point density of data. In this paper, we propose a 3DCNN-DQN-RNN method which fuses the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Residual recurrent neural network (RNN) for an efficient semantic parsing of large-scale 3D point clouds. In our method, an eye window under control of the 3D CNN and DQN can localize and segment the points of the class objects efficiently. The 3D CNN and Residual RNN further extract robust and discriminative features of the points in the eye window, and thus greatly enhance the parsing accuracy of large-scale point clouds. Our method provides an automatic process that maps the raw data to the classification results. It also integrates object localization, segmentation and classification into one framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud classification methods."}

This is a difficult task that requires extracting meaningful spatio-temporal features to capture activities, accurately localizing the start and end times of each activity. We introduce a new model, Region Convolutional 3D Network (R-C3D), which encodes the video streams using a three-dimensional fully convolutional network, then generates candidate temporal regions containing activities, and finally classifies selected regions into specific activities. Computation is saved due to the sharing of convolutional features between the proposal and the classification pipelines. The entire model is trained end-to-end with jointly optimized localization and classification losses. R-C3D is faster than existing methods (569 frames per second on a single Titan X Maxwell GPU) and achieves state-of-the-art results on THUMOS'14.

Recently, the regression-based object detectors and long-term recurrent convolutional network (LRCN) have demonstrated superior performance in human action detection and recognition. However, the regression-based detectors performs inference without considering the temporal context among neighboring frames, and the LRCN using global visual percepts lacks the capability to capture local temporal dynamics. In this paper, we present a novel framework called TORNADO for human action proposal detection in un-trimmed video clips. Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal convolutional network that combines the advantages of regression-based detector and LRCN by empowering Convolutional LSTM with regression capability. Our approach consists of a temporal convolutional regression network (T-CRN) and a spatial regression network (S-CRN) which are trained end-to-end on both RGB and OpticalFlow streams. They fuse appearance, motion and temporal contexts to regress the bounding boxes of candidate human actions simultaneously in 28 FPS. The action proposals are constructed by solving dynamic programming with peak trimming of the generated action boxes.

Achieving broad generalization typically requires large datasets, which are difficult to obtain for task-specific interactive processes such as reinforcement learning or learning from demonstration. However, much of the visual diversity in the world can be captured through passively collected datasets of images or videos. In our method, which we refer to as GPLAC (Generalized Policy Learning with Attentional Classifier), we use both interaction data and weakly labeled image data to augment the generalization capacity of sensorimotor policies. Our method combines multitask learning on action selection and an auxiliary binary classification objective, together with a convolutional neural network architecture that uses an attentional mechanism to avoid distractors. We show that pairing interaction data from just a single environment with a diverse dataset of weakly labeled data results in greatly improved generalization to unseen environments, and show that this generalization depends on both the auxiliary objective and the attentional architecture that we propose. We demonstrate our results in both simulation and on a real robotic manipulator, and demonstrate substantial improvement over standard convolutional architectures and domain adaptation methods."}

Samples generated by existing text-to-image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid object parts. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) to generate 256x256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions."}

At best, this leads to a loss of trust in digital content, but could potentially cause further harm by spreading false information or fake news. This paper examines the realism of state-of-the-art image manipulations, and how difficult it is to detect them, either automatically or by humans. To standardize the evaluation of detection methods, we propose an automated benchmark for facial manipulation detection. In particular, the benchmark is based on Deep-Fakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap and NeuralTextures as prominent representatives for facial manipulations at random compression level and size. The benchmark is publicly available and contains a hidden test set as well as a database of over 1.8 million manipulated images. This dataset is over an order of magnitude larger than comparable, publicly available, forgery datasets. Based on this data, we performed a thorough analysis of data-driven forgery detectors. We show that the use of additional domain-specific knowledge improves forgery detection to unprecedented accuracy, even in the presence of strong compression, and clearly outperforms human observers."}

Different from other keypoint based methods where a RANSAC procedure is usually needed, we implement the use of various deep neural network structures to establish an end-to-end trainable network. Our keypoint detector is trained through this end-to-end structure and enables the system to avoid the interference of dynamic objects, leverages the help of sufficiently salient features on stationary objects, and as a result, achieves high robustness. Rather than searching the corresponding points among existing points, the key contribution is that we innovatively generate them based on learned matching probabilities among a group of candidates, which can boost the registration accuracy. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of our approach using both the KITTI dataset and the Apollo-SouthBay dataset. Results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable registration accuracy and runtime efficiency to the state-of-the-art geometry-based methods, but with higher robustness to inaccurate initial poses. Detailed ablation and visualization analysis are included to further illustrate the behavior and insights of our network. The low registration error and high robustness of our method make it attractive to the substantial applications relying on the point cloud registration task."}

In order to gain robustness to such changes, long-term localization approaches often use segmantic segmentations as an invariant scene representation, as the semantic meaning of each scene part should not be affected by seasonal and other changes. However, these representations are typically not very discriminative due to the very limited number of available classes. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network, the Fine-Grained Segmentation Network (FGSN), that can be used to provide image segmentations with a larger number of labels and can be trained in a self-supervised fashion. In addition, we show how FGSNs can be trained to output consistent labels across seasonal changes. We show through extensive experiments that integrating the fine-grained segmentations produced by our FGSNs into existing localization algorithms leads to substantial improvements in localization performance."}

The 6D camera pose of the query image can be estimated with the predicted scene coordinate map. Additionally, the dense prediction can be used for other online robotic and AR applications such as obstacle avoidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method on both indoor and outdoor benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance."}

This is achieved by extending recent ideas from learning of unsupervised image denoisers to unstructured 3D point clouds. Unsupervised image denoisers operate under the assumption that a noisy pixel observation is a random realization of a distribution around a clean pixel value, which allows appropriate learning on this distribution to eventually converge to the correct value. Regrettably, this assumption is not valid for unstructured points: 3D point clouds are subject to total noise, i.e. deviations in all coordinates, with no reliable pixel grid. Thus, an observation can be the realization of an entire manifold of clean 3D points, which makes the quality of a naive extension of unsupervised image denoisers to 3D point clouds unfortunately only little better than mean filtering. To overcome this, and to enable effective and unsupervised 3D point cloud denoising, we introduce a spatial prior term, that steers converges to the unique closest out of the many possible modes on the manifold. Our results demonstrate unsupervised denoising performance similar to that of supervised learning with clean data when given enough training examples - whereby we do not need any pairs of noisy and clean training data."}

However, domain adversarial methods render suboptimal performances since they attempt to match the distributions among the domains without considering the task at hand. We propose Drop to Adapt (DTA), which leverages adversarial dropout to learn strongly discriminative features by enforcing the cluster assumption.

The classical method of training CNNs is by labeling images in a supervised manner as in \"input image belongs to this label\" (Positive Learning; PL), which is a fast and accurate method if the labels are assigned correctly to all images. However, if inaccurate labels, or noisy labels, exist, training with PL will provide wrong information, thus severely degrading performance. To address this issue, we start with an indirect learning method called Negative Learning (NL), in which the CNNs are trained using a complementary label as in \"input image does not belong to this complementary label.\" Because the chances of selecting a true label as a complementary label are low, NL decreases the risk of providing incorrect information. Furthermore, to improve convergence, we extend our method by adopting PL selectively, termed as Selective Negative Learning and Positive Learning (SelNLPL). PL is used selectively to train upon expected-to-be-clean data, whose choices become possible as NL progresses, thus resulting in superior performance of filtering out noisy data. With simple semi-supervised training technique, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for noisy data classification, proving the superiority of SelNLPL's noisy data filtering ability."}

However, \"casual\" photos of documents are usually unsuitable for automatic information extraction, mainly due to physical distortion of the document paper, as well as various camera positions and illumination conditions.

Our insight is that the 3D geometry of the document not only determines the warping of its texture but also causes the illumination effects. Therefore, our novelty resides on the explicit modeling of 3D shape for document paper in an end-to-end pipeline. Also, we contribute the largest and most comprehensive dataset for document image unwarping to date - Doc3D. This dataset features multiple ground-truth annotations, including 3D shape, surface normals, UV map, albedo image, etc. Training with Doc3D, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for DewarpNet with extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Existing rPPG approaches rely on analyzing very fine details of facial videos, which are prone to be affected by video compression. Here we propose a two-stage, end-to-end method using hidden rPPG information enhancement and attention networks, which is the first attempt to counter video compression loss and recover rPPG signals from highly compressed videos. The method includes two parts: 1) a Spatio-Temporal Video Enhancement Network (STVEN) for video enhancement, and 2) an rPPG network (rPPGNet) for rPPG signal recovery. The rPPGNet can work on its own for robust rPPG measurement, and the STVEN network can be added and jointly trained to further boost the performance especially on highly compressed videos. Comprehensive experiments are performed on two benchmark datasets to show that, 1) the proposed method not only achieves superior performance on compressed videos with high-quality videos pair, 2) it also generalizes well on novel data with only compressed videos available, which implies the promising potential for real-world applications."}

Projections arise in various contexts, such as long-exposure photography, where a dynamic scene is collapsed in time to produce a motion-blurred image, and corner cameras, where reflected light from a scene is collapsed along a spatial dimension because of an edge occluder to yield a 1D video. Deprojection is ill-posed-- often there are many plausible solutions for a given input. We first propose a probabilistic model capturing the ambiguity of the task. We then present a variational inference strategy using convolutional neural networks as functional approximators. Sampling from the inference network at test time yields plausible candidates from the distribution of original signals that are consistent with a given input projection. We evaluate the method on several datasets for both spatial and temporal deprojection tasks. We first demonstrate the method can recover human gait videos and face images from spatial projections, and then show that it can recover videos of moving digits from dramatically motion-blurred images obtained via temporal projection."}

However, most of them may either fail to reconstruct reasonable structures or restore fine-grained textures. In order to solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a two-stage model which splits the inpainting task into two parts: structure reconstruction and texture generation. In the first stage, edge-preserved smooth images are employed to train a structure reconstructor which completes the missing structures of the inputs. In the second stage, based on the reconstructed structures, a texture generator using appearance flow is designed to yield image details. Experiments on multiple publicly available datasets show the superior performance of the proposed network."}

The development and proliferation of GANs raises an interesting question: can we train a GAN to remove an object, if present, from an image while otherwise preserving the image? Specifically, can a GAN \"virtually heal\" anyone by turning his medical image, with an unknown health status (diseased or healthy), into a healthy one, so that diseased regions could be revealed by subtracting those two images? Such a task requires a GAN to identify a minimal subset of target pixels for domain translation, an ability that we call fixed-point translation, which no GAN is equipped with yet. Therefore, we propose a new GAN, called Fixed-Point GAN, trained by (1) supervising same-domain translation through a conditional identity loss, and (2) regularizing cross-domain translation through revised adversarial, domain classification, and cycle consistency loss. Based on fixed-point translation, we further derive a novel framework for disease detection and localization using only image-level annotation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art in multi-domain image-to-image translation and that it surpasses predominant weakly-supervised localization methods in both disease detection and localization. Implementation is available at https://github.com/jlianglab/Fixed-Point-GAN."}

Vehicle ReID is challenging due to 1) high intra-class variability (caused by the dependency of shape and appearance on viewpoint), and 2) small inter-class variability (caused by the similarity in shape and appearance between vehicles produced by different manufacturers). To address these challenges, we propose a Pose-Aware Multi-Task Re-Identification (PAMTRI) framework. This approach includes two innovations compared with previous methods. First, it overcomes viewpoint-dependency by explicitly reasoning about vehicle pose and shape via keypoints, heatmaps and segments from pose estimation. Second, it jointly classifies semantic vehicle attributes (colors and types) while performing ReID, through multi-task learning with the embedded pose representations. Since manually labeling images with detailed pose and attribute information is prohibitive, we create a large-scale highly randomized synthetic dataset with automatically annotated vehicle attributes for training. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of each proposed component, showing that PAMTRI achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art on two mainstream vehicle ReID benchmarks: VeRi and CityFlow-ReID."}

A promising approach to address these problems is quantization. However, uniformly quantizing a model to ultra-low precision leads to significant accuracy degradation. A novel solution for this is to use mixed-precision quantization, as some parts of the network may allow lower precision as compared to other layers. However, there is no systematic way to determine the precision of different layers. A brute force approach is not feasible for deep networks, as the search space for mixed-precision is exponential in the number of layers. Another challenge is a similar factorial complexity for determining block-wise fine-tuning order when quantizing the model to a target precision. Here, we introduce Hessian AWare Quantization (HAWQ), a novel second-order quantization method to address these problems. HAWQ allows for the automatic selection of the relative quantization precision of each layer, based on the layer's Hessian spectrum. Moreover, HAWQ provides a deterministic fine-tuning order for quantizing layers. We show the results of our method on Cifar-10 using ResNet20, and on ImageNet using Inception-V3, ResNet50 and SqueezeNext models. Comparing HAWQ with state-of-the-art shows that we can achieve similar/better accuracy with 8x activation compression ratio on ResNet20, as compared to DNAS, and up to 1% higher accuracy with up to 14% smaller models on ResNet50 and Inception-V3, compared to recently proposed methods of RVQuant and HAQ. Furthermore, we show that we can quantize SqueezeNext to just 1MB model size while achieving above 68% top1 accuracy on ImageNet."}

The photos people upload to social media are a historical and public data source of how people dress across the world and at different times. While we now have tools to automatically recognize the clothing and style attributes of what people are wearing in these photographs, we lack the ability to analyze spatial and temporal trends in these attributes or make predictions about the future. In this paper we address this need by providing an automatic framework that analyzes large corpora of street imagery to (a) discover and forecast long-term trends of various fashion attributes as well as automatically discovered styles, and (b) identify spatio-temporally localized events that affect what people wear. We show that our framework makes long term trend forecasts that are > 20% more accurate than prior art, and identifies hundreds of socially meaningful events that impact fashion across the globe."}

To our knowledge, it is the largest UAV-based vehicle ReID dataset. To increase intra-class variation, each vehicle is captured by at least two UAVs at different locations, with diverse view-angles and flight-altitudes. We manually label a variety of vehicle attributes, including vehicle type, color, skylight, bumper, spare tire and luggage rack. Furthermore, for each vehicle image, the annotator is also required to mark the discriminative parts that helps them to distinguish this particular vehicle from others. Besides the dataset, we also design a specific vehicle ReID algorithm to make full use of the rich annotation information. It is capable of explicitly detecting discriminative parts for each specific vehicle and significantly outperforming the evaluated baselines and state-of-the-art vehicle ReID approaches."}

A false positive (FP) from a false localization during autonomous driving can lead to fatal accidents and hinder safe and efficient driving. Therefore, a detection algorithm that can cope with mislocalizations is required in autonomous driving applications. This paper proposes a method for improving the detection accuracy while supporting a real-time operation by modeling the bounding box (bbox) of YOLOv3, which is the most representative of one-stage detectors, with a Gaussian parameter and redesigning the loss function. In addition, this paper proposes a method for predicting the localization uncertainty that indicates the reliability of bbox. By using the predicted localization uncertainty during the detection process, the proposed schemes can significantly reduce the FP and increase the true positive (TP), thereby improving the accuracy. Compared to a conventional YOLOv3, the proposed algorithm, Gaussian YOLOv3, improves the mean average precision (mAP) by 3.09 and 3.5 on the KITTI and Berkeley deep drive (BDD) datasets, respectively. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm is capable of real-time detection at faster than 42 frames per second (fps) and shows a higher accuracy than previous approaches with a similar fps. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is the most suitable for autonomous driving applications."}

Instead, of employing \"blind\" domain randomization, i.e., augmenting synthetic renderings with random backgrounds or changing illumination and colorization, we leverage the task network as its own adversarial guide toward useful augmentations that maximize the uncertainty of the output. To this end, we design a min-max optimization scheme where a given task competes against a special deception network to minimize the task error subject to the specific constraints enforced by the deceiver. The deception network samples from a family of differentiable pixel-level perturbations and exploits the task architecture to find the most destructive augmentations. Unlike GAN-based approaches that require unlabeled data from the target domain, our method achieves robust mappings that scale well to multiple target distributions from source data alone. We apply our framework to the tasks of digit recognition on enhanced MNIST variants, classification and object pose estimation on the Cropped LineMOD dataset as well as semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset and compare it to a number of domain adaptation approaches, thereby demonstrating similar results with superior generalization capabilities."}

In this paper, we analyze the object detection from video and point out that mAP alone is not sufficient to capture the temporal nature of video object detection. To tackle this problem, we propose a comprehensive metric, Average Delay (AD), to measure and compare detection delay. To facilitate delay evaluation, we carefully select a subset of ImageNet VID, which we name as ImageNet VIDT with an emphasis on complex trajectories. By extensively evaluating a wide range of detectors on VIDT, we show that most methods drastically increase the detection delay but still preserve mAP well. In other words, mAP is not sensitive enough to reflect the temporal characteristics of a video object detector. Our results suggest that video object detection methods should be evaluated with a delay metric, particularly for latency-critical applications such as autonomous vehicle perception."}

First, we simplify the current fine tuning based approaches which use a combination of classification and distillation losses to compensate for the limited availability of past data. We find that the distillation term actually hurts performance when a memory is allowed. Then, we modify the usual class IL memory component. Similar to existing works, a first memory stores exemplar images of past classes. A second memory is introduced here to store past class statistics obtained when they were initially learned. The intuition here is that classes are best modeled when all their data are available and that their initial statistics are useful across different incremental states. A prediction bias towards newly learned classes appears during inference because the dataset is imbalanced in their favor. The challenge is to make predictions of new and past classes more comparable. To do this, scores of past classes are rectified by leveraging contents from both memories. The method has negligible added cost, both in terms of memory and of inference complexity. Experiments with three large public datasets show that the proposed approach is more effective than a range of competitive state-of-the-art methods."}

Concretely, for each pixel, a novel criss-cross attention module in CCNet harvests the contextual information of all the pixels on its criss-cross path. By taking a further recurrent operation, each pixel can finally capture the full-image dependencies from all pixels. Overall, CCNet is with the following merits: 1) GPU memory friendly.

Generally, proposal-free methods generate instance-agnostic semantic segmentation labels and instance-aware features to group pixels into different object instances. However, previous methods mostly employ separate modules for these two sub-tasks and require multiple passes for inference. We argue that treating these two sub-tasks separately is suboptimal. In fact, employing multiple separate modules significantly reduces the potential for application. The mutual benefits between the two complementary sub-tasks are also unexplored. To this end, this work proposes a single-shot proposal-free instance segmentation method that requires only one single pass for prediction. Our method is based on a pixel-pair affinity pyramid, which computes the probability that two pixels belong to the same instance in a hierarchical manner. The affinity pyramid can also be jointly learned with the semantic class labeling and achieve mutual benefits. Moreover, incorporating with the learned affinity pyramid, a novel cascaded graph partition module is presented to sequentially generate instances from coarse to fine. Unlike previous time-consuming graph partition methods, this module achieves 5x speedup and 9% relative improvement on Average-Precision (AP). Our approach achieves new state of the art on the challenging Cityscapes dataset."}

Motivated by the observation that the object part, full object, and a collection of objects essentially differ in size, we propose a new concept called scale-diversity, which characterizes the spectrum of segmentations w.r.t. different scales. To address this, we present MultiSeg, a scale-diverse interactive image segmentation network that incorporates a set of two-dimensional scale priors into the model to generate a set of scale-varying proposals that conform to the user input. We explicitly encourage segmentation diversity during training by synthesizing diverse training samples for a given image. As a result, our method allows the user to quickly locate the closest segmentation target for further refinement if necessary. Despite its simplicity, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is capable of quickly producing diverse yet plausible segmentation outputs, reducing the user interaction required, especially in cases where many types of segmentations (object parts or groups) are expected."}

Then, we further present the solution using deep unsupervised domain adaptation and propose a deep information maximization adaptation network (IMAN) to alleviate this bias by using Caucasian as source domain and other races as target domains. This unsupervised method simultaneously aligns global distribution to decrease race gap at domain-level, and learns the discriminative target representations at cluster level.

In particular, we consider general subjects such as non-human species where attaining a large scale annotated dataset is challenging. While multiview geometry can be used to self-supervise the unlabeled data, integrating the geometry into learning a keypoint detector is challenging due to representation mismatch. We address this mismatch by formulating a new differentiable representation of the epipolar constraint called epipolar divergence---a generalized distance from the epipolar lines to the corresponding keypoint distribution. Epipolar divergence characterizes when two view keypoint distributions produce zero reprojection error. We design a twin network that minimizes the epipolar divergence through stereo rectification that can significantly alleviate computational complexity and sampling aliasing in training. We demonstrate that our framework can localize customized keypoints of diverse species, e.g., humans, dogs, and monkeys."}

The proposed 3D articulated pose estimation paradigm is different from the state-of-the-art encoder-decoder based FCN, 3D CNN and point-set based manners. To discover informative anchor points towards certain joint, anchor proposal procedure is also proposed for A2J. Meanwhile 2D CNN (i.e., ResNet- 50) is used as backbone network to drive A2J, without using time-consuming 3D convolutional or deconvolutional layers. The experiments on 3 hand datasets and 2 body datasets verify A2J's superiority. Meanwhile, A2J is of high running speed around 100 FPS on single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU."}

Recent approaches have made significant progress towards regressing the parameters of parametric human body models directly from images. Because of the absence of images with 3D shape ground truth, relevant approaches rely on 2D annotations or sophisticated architecture designs. In this work, we advocate that there are more cues we can leverage, which are available for free in natural images, i.e., without getting more annotations, or modifying the network architecture. We propose a natural form of supervision, that capitalizes on the appearance constancy of a person among different frames (or viewpoints). This seemingly insignificant and often overlooked cue goes a long way for model-based pose estimation. The parametric model we employ allows us to compute a texture map for each frame. Assuming that the texture of the person does not change dramatically between frames, we can apply a novel texture consistency loss, which enforces that each point in the texture map has the same texture value across all frames. Since the texture is transferred in this common texture map space, no camera motion computation is necessary, or even an assumption of smoothness among frames. This makes our proposed supervision applicable in a variety of settings, ranging from monocular video, to multi-view images. We benchmark our approach against strong baselines that require the same or even more annotations that we do and we consistently outperform them. Simultaneously, we achieve state-of-the-art results among model-based pose estimation approaches in different benchmarks.

In this paper, we analyze cross-dataset generalization when training on existing datasets. We find that approaches perform well on the datasets they are trained on, but do not generalize to other datasets or in-the-wild scenarios. As a consequence, we introduce the first large-scale, multi-view hand dataset that is accompanied by both 3D hand pose and shape annotations. For annotating this real-world dataset, we propose an iterative, semi-automated `human-in-the-loop' approach, which includes hand fitting optimization to infer both the 3D pose and shape for each sample. We show that methods trained on our dataset consistently perform well when tested on other datasets. Moreover, the dataset allows us to train a network that predicts the full articulated hand shape from a single RGB image. The evaluation set can serve as a benchmark for articulated hand shape estimation."}

Most of the large activity recognition datasets consist of data sourced from the web, which does not reflect challenges that exist in activities of daily living. In this paper, we introduce a large real-world video dataset for activities of daily living: Toyota Smarthome. The dataset consists of 16K RGB+D clips of 31 activity classes, performed by seniors in a smarthome. Unlike previous datasets, videos were fully unscripted. As a result, the dataset poses several challenges: high intra-class variation, high class imbalance, simple and composite activities, and activities with similar motion and variable duration. Activities were annotated with both coarse and fine-grained labels. These characteristics differentiate Toyota Smarthome from other datasets for activity recognition. As recent activity recognition approaches fail to address the challenges posed by Toyota Smarthome, we present a novel activity recognition method with attention mechanism. We propose a pose driven spatio-temporal attention mechanism through 3D ConvNets. We show that our novel method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, as well as on the Toyota Smarthome dataset. We release the dataset for research use."}

However, labeled video data required to train such models has not been able to keep up with the ever increasing depth and sophistication of these networks. In this work we propose an alternative approach to learning video representations that requires no semantically labeled videos, and instead leverages the years of effort in collecting and labeling large and clean still-image datasets. We do so by using state-of-the-art models pre-trained on image datasets as \"teachers\" to train video models in a distillation framework. We demonstrate that our method learns truly spatiotemporal features, despite being trained only using supervision from still-image networks. Moreover, it learns good representations across different input modalities, using completely uncurated raw video data sources and with different 2D teacher models. Our method obtains strong transfer performance, outperforming standard techniques for bootstrapping video architectures with image based models by 16%. We believe that our approach opens up new approaches for learning spatiotemporal representations from unlabeled video data."}

Automating the process of action recognition from visual data has been the topic of much research in the computer vision community. But what if it is too dark, or if the person is occluded or behind a wall? In this paper, we introduce a neural network model that can detect human actions through walls and occlusions, and in poor lighting conditions. Our model takes radio frequency (RF) signals as input, generates 3D human skeletons as an intermediate representation, and recognizes actions and interactions of multiple people over time. By translating the input to an intermediate skeleton-based representation, our model can learn from both vision-based and RF-based datasets, and allow the two tasks to help each other. We show that our model achieves comparable accuracy to vision-based action recognition systems in visible scenarios, yet continues to work accurately when people are not visible, hence addressing scenarios that are beyond the limit of today's vision-based action recognition."}

Recent works exploit synthetic data to train the model for semantic segmentation, but the domain adaptation between real and synthetic images remains a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a Separated Semantic Feature based domain adaptation network, named SSF-DAN, for semantic segmentation. First, a Semantic-wise Separable Discriminator (SS-D) is designed to independently adapt semantic features across the target and source domains, which addresses the inconsistent adaptation issue in the class-wise adversarial learning. In SS-D, a progressive confidence strategy is included to achieve a more reliable separation. Then, an efficient Class-wise Adversarial loss Reweighting module (CA-R) is introduced to balance the class-wise adversarial learning process, which leads the generator to focus more on poorly adapted classes. The presented framework demonstrates robust performance, superior to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets."}

The variable density, random orientation, small size, and instance-to-instance heterogeneity of objects in overhead imagery calls for approaches distinct from existing models designed for natural scene datasets. Though new overhead imagery datasets are being developed, they almost universally comprise a single view taken from directly overhead (\"at nadir\"), failing to address a critical variable: look angle. By contrast, views vary in real-world overhead imagery, particularly in dynamic scenarios such as natural disasters where first looks are often over 40 degrees off-nadir. This represents an important challenge to computer vision methods, as changing view angle adds distortions, alters resolution, and changes lighting. At present, the impact of these perturbations for algorithmic detection and segmentation of objects is untested. To address this problem, we present an open source Multi-View Overhead Imagery dataset, termed SpaceNet MVOI, with 27 unique looks from a broad range of viewing angles (-32.5 degrees to 54.0 degrees). Each of these images cover the same 665 square km geographic extent and are annotated with 126,747 building footprint labels, enabling direct assessment of the impact of viewpoint perturbation on model performance. We benchmark multiple leading segmentation and object detection models on: (1) building detection, (2) generalization to unseen viewing angles and resolutions, and (3) sensitivity of building footprint extraction to changes in resolution. We find that state of the art segmentation and object detection models struggle to identify buildings in off-nadir imagery and generalize poorly to unseen views, presenting an important benchmark to explore the broadly relevant challenge of detecting small, heterogeneous target objects in visually dynamic contexts."}

While many previous works learn to hallucinate the shape directly from priors, we resort to further improving the shape quality by leveraging cross-view information with a graph convolutional network. Instead of building a direct mapping function from images to 3D shape, our model learns to predict series of deformations to improve a coarse shape iteratively. Inspired by traditional multiple view geometry methods, our network samples nearby area around the initial mesh's vertex locations and reasons an optimal deformation using perceptual feature statistics built from multiple input images. Extensive experiments show that our model produces accurate 3D shape that are not only visually plausible from the input perspectives, but also well aligned to arbitrary viewpoints. With the help of physically driven architecture, our model also exhibits generalization capability across different semantic categories, number of input images, and quality of mesh initialization."}

We refer to this reconstruction as QUARCH (QUasi-Affine Reconstruction with respect to Camera centers and the Hodographs of horopters). A QUARCH can be obtained by solving a semidefinite programming problem when, (i) the images have been captured by a moving camera with constant intrinsic parameters, and (ii) a vague knowledge of the relative orientation (under or over 120 degrees) between camera pairs is available. The resulting reconstruction comes close enough to an affine one allowing thus an easy upgrade of the QUARCH to its affine and metric counterparts. We also present a constrained Levenberg-Marquardt method for nonlinear optimization subject to Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) constraints so as to ensure that the QUARCH LMIs are satisfied during optimization. Experiments with synthetic and real data show the benefits of QUARCH in reliably obtaining a metric reconstruction."}

Besides the challenges in image-based virtual try-on (e.g., clothes fidelity, image synthesis), video virtual try-on further requires spatiotemporal consistency. Directly adopting existing image-based approaches often fails to generate coherent video with natural and realistic textures. In this work, we propose Flow-navigated Warping Generative Adversarial Network (FW-GAN), a novel framework that learns to synthesize the video of virtual try-on based on a person image, the desired clothes image, and a series of target poses. FW-GAN aims to synthesize the coherent and natural video while manipulating the pose and clothes. It consists of: (i) a flow-guided fusion module that warps the past frames to assist synthesis, which is also adopted in the discriminator to help enhance the coherence and quality of the synthesized video; (ii) a warping net that is designed to warp clothes image for the refinement of clothes textures; (iii) a parsing constraint loss that alleviates the problem caused by the misalignment of segmentation maps from images with different poses and various clothes. Experiments on our newly collected dataset show that FW-GAN can synthesize high-quality video of virtual try-on and significantly outperforms other methods both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

Despite the great success of the generic object detection methods trained on ground-to-ground images, a huge performance drop is observed when they are directly applied to images captured by UAVs. The unsatisfactory performance is owing to many UAV-specific nuisances, such as varying flying altitudes, adverse weather conditions, dynamically changing viewing angles, etc. Those nuisances constitute a large number of fine-grained domains, across which the detection model has to stay robust. Fortunately, UAVs will record meta-data that depict those varying attributes, which are either freely available along with the UAV images, or can be easily obtained. We propose to utilize those free meta-data in conjunction with associated UAV images to learn domain-robust features via an adversarial training framework dubbed Nuisance Disentangled Feature Transform (NDFT), for the specific challenging problem of object detection in UAV images, achieving a substantial gain in robustness to those nuisances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, by showing state-of-the- art performance (single model) on two existing UAV-based object detection benchmarks.

The most widely investigated security concern of DNN is from its malicious input, a.k.a adversarial example. Nevertheless, the security challenge of DNN's parameters is not well explored yet. In this work, we are the first to propose a novel DNN weight attack methodology called Bit-Flip Attack (BFA) which can crush a neural network through maliciously flipping extremely small amount of bits within its weight storage memory system (i.e., DRAM). The bit-flip operations could be conducted through well-known Row-Hammer attack, while our main contribution is to develop an algorithm to identify the most vulnerable bits of DNN weight parameters (stored in memory as binary bits), that could maximize the accuracy degradation with a minimum number of bit-flips. Our proposed BFA utilizes a Progressive Bit Search (PBS) method which combines gradient ranking and progressive search to identify the most vulnerable bit to be flipped. With the aid of PBS, we can successfully attack a ResNet-18 fully malfunction (i.e., top-1 accuracy degrade from 69.8% to 0.1%) only through 13 bit-flips out of 93 million bits, while randomly flipping 100 bits merely degrades the accuracy by less than 1%.

However, these approaches often report lower accuracy in evaluating the searched architecture or transferring it to another dataset. This is arguably due to the large gap between the architecture depths in search and evaluation scenarios. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm which allows the depth of searched architectures to grow gradually during the training procedure. This brings two issues, namely, heavier computational overheads and weaker search stability, which we solve using search space approximation and regularization, respectively. With a significantly reduced search time ( 7 hours on a single GPU), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the proxy dataset (CIFAR10 or CIFAR100) and the target dataset (ImageNet).

PPA hardware consists of a fine-grained array of general-purpose processing elements, each capable of light capture, data storage, program execution, and communication with neighboring elements. This allows images to be stored and manipulated directly at the point of light capture, rather than having to transfer images to external processing hardware. Our CNN approach divides this array up into 4x4 blocks of processing elements, essentially trading-off image resolution for increased local memory capacity per 4x4 \"pixel\". We implement parallel operations for image addition, subtraction and bit-shifting images in this 4x4 block format. Using these components we formulate how to perform ternary weight convolutions upon these images, compactly store results of such convolutions, perform max-pooling, and transfer the resulting sub-sampled data to an attached micro-controller. We train ternary weight filter CNNs for digit recognition and a simple tracking task, and demonstrate inference of these networks upon the SCAMP5 PPA system.

The number of possible sharing patterns are combinatorial in the depth of the network and the number of tasks, and thus hand-crafting an architecture, purely based on the human intuitions of task relationships can be time-consuming and suboptimal. In this paper, we present a probabilistic approach to learning task-specific and shared representations in CNNs for multi-task learning. Specifically, we propose \"stochastic filter groups\" (SFG), a mechanism to assign convolution kernels in each layer to \"specialist\" and \"generalist\" groups, which are specific to and shared across different tasks, respectively. The SFG modules determine the connectivity between layers and the structures of task-specific and shared representations in the network. We employ variational inference to learn the posterior distribution over the possible grouping of kernels and network parameters. Experiments demonstrate the proposed method generalises across multiple tasks and shows improved performance over baseline methods."}

Previous works may not effectively uncover the underlying reasons that would lead to the drastic model degradation on the target task. In this paper, we empirically reveal that the erratic discrimination of the target domain mainly stems from its much smaller feature norms with respect to that of the source domain. To this end, we propose a novel parameter-free Adaptive Feature Norm approach. We demonstrate that progressively adapting the feature norms of the two domains to a large range of values can result in significant transfer gains, implying that those task-specific features with larger norms are more transferable. Our method successfully unifies the computation of both standard and partial domain adaptation with more robustness against the negative transfer issue. Without bells and whistles but a few lines of code, our method substantially lifts the performance on the target task and exceeds state-of-the-arts by a large margin (11.5% on Office-Home and 17.1% on VisDA2017).

Most existing approaches independently address task-transferability and cross-domain adaptation, resulting in limited generalization. In this paper, we propose UM-Adapt - a unified framework to effectively perform unsupervised domain adaptation for spatially-structured prediction tasks, simultaneously maintaining a balanced performance across individual tasks in a multi-task setting. To realize this, we propose two novel regularization strategies; a) Contour-based content regularization (CCR) and b) exploitation of inter-task coherency using a cross-task distillation module. Furthermore, avoiding a conventional ad-hoc domain discriminator, we re-utilize the cross-task distillation loss as output of an energy function to adversarially minimize the input domain discrepancy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate superior generalizability of the learned representations simultaneously for multiple tasks under domain-shifts from synthetic to natural environments. UM-Adapt yields state-of-the-art transfer learning results on ImageNet classification and comparable performance on PASCAL VOC 2007 detection task, even with a smaller backbone-net.

Existing scanning lidar systems achieve low spatial resolution at large ranges due to mechanically-limited angular sampling rates, restricting scene understanding tasks to close-range clusters with dense sampling. Moreover, today's pulsed lidar scanners suffer from high cost, power consumption, large form-factors, and they fail in the presence of strong backscatter. We depart from point scanning and demonstrate that it is possible to turn a low-cost CMOS gated imager into a dense depth camera with at least 80m range - by learning depth from three gated images. The proposed architecture exploits semantic context across gated slices, and is trained on a synthetic discriminator loss without the need of dense depth labels. The proposed replacement for scanning lidar systems is real-time, handles back-scatter and provides dense depth at long ranges.

In essence, our method allows to complete shape in general indoor scenes behind what is sensed by the RGB-D camera, which may be crucial e.g. for robotic manipulation tasks or efficient scene exploration.

To prove this, we introduce ScanObjectNN, a new real-world point cloud object dataset based on scanned indoor scene data. From our comprehensive benchmark, we show that our dataset poses great challenges to existing point cloud classification techniques as objects from real-world scans are often cluttered with background and/or are partial due to occlusions.

Training on the normal data, the autoencoder is expected to produce higher reconstruction error for the abnormal inputs than the normal ones, which is adopted as a criterion for identifying anomalies. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. It has been observed that sometimes the autoencoder \"generalizes\" so well that it can also reconstruct anomalies well, leading to the miss detection of anomalies. To mitigate this drawback for autoencoder based anomaly detector, we propose to augment the autoencoder with a memory module and develop an improved autoencoder called memory-augmented autoencoder, i.e. MemAE. Given an input, MemAE firstly obtains the encoding from the encoder and then uses it as a query to retrieve the most relevant memory items for reconstruction. At the training stage, the memory contents are updated and are encouraged to represent the prototypical elements of the normal data. At the test stage, the learned memory will be fixed, and the reconstruction is obtained from a few selected memory records of the normal data. The reconstruction will thus tend to be close to a normal sample. Thus the reconstructed errors on anomalies will be strengthened for anomaly detection. MemAE is free of assumptions on the data type and thus general to be applied to different tasks. Experiments on various datasets prove the excellent generalization and high effectiveness of the proposed MemAE."}

Our system consists of an end-to-end trainable convolutional network. In contrast to the existing methods, our system utilizes entirely free-form user input in terms of color and shape. This allows the system to respond to the user's sketch and color inputs, using them as guidelines to generate an image. In this work, we trained the network with an additional style loss, which made it possible to generate realistic results despite large portions of the image being removed. Our proposed network architecture SC-FEGAN is well suited for generating high-quality synthetic images using intuitive user inputs."}

Recent AutoML approaches promise to relieve us from this effort. However, they are mainly designed for comparatively small-scale classification tasks. In this work, we show how to use and extend existing AutoML techniques to efficiently optimize large-scale U-Net-like encoder-decoder architectures. In particular, we leverage gradient-based neural architecture search and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter search. The resulting optimization does not require a large-scale compute cluster. We show results on disparity estimation that clearly outperform the manually optimized baseline and reach state-of-the-art performance."}

In this paper, we aim to fully leverage the potential of styles to improve the performance of CNNs in general vision tasks. We propose a Style-based Recalibration Module (SRM), a simple yet effective architectural unit, which adaptively recalibrates intermediate feature maps by exploiting their styles. SRM first extracts the style information from each channel of the feature maps by style pooling, then estimates per-channel recalibration weight via channel-independent style integration. By incorporating the relative importance of individual styles into feature maps, SRM effectively enhances the representational ability of a CNN. The proposed module is directly fed into existing CNN architectures with negligible overhead. We conduct comprehensive experiments on general image recognition as well as tasks related to styles, which verify the benefit of SRM over recent approaches such as Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE). To explain the inherent difference between SRM and SE, we provide an in-depth comparison of their representational properties."}

In the latter case, the optimization is often non-differentiable and also not very amenable to derivative-free optimization methods. Most methods in use today require sizable computational resources. And if we want networks that additionally satisfy resource constraints, the above challenges are exacerbated because the search must now balance accuracy with certain budget constraints on resources. We formulate this problem as the optimization of a set function -- we find that the empirical behavior of this set function often (but not always) satisfies marginal gain and monotonicity principles -- properties central to the idea of submodularity. Based on this observation, we adapt algorithms within discrete optimization to obtain heuristic schemes for neural network architecture search, where we have resource constraints on the architecture. This simple scheme when applied on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, identifies resource-constrained architectures with quantifiably better performance than current state-of-the-art models designed for mobile devices. Specifically, we find high-performing architectures with fewer parameters and computations by a search method that is much faster."}

We propose Asymmetric Convolution Block (ACB), an architecture-neutral structure as a CNN building block, which uses 1D asymmetric convolutions to strengthen the square convolution kernels. For an off-the-shelf architecture, we replace the standard square-kernel convolutional layers with ACBs to construct an Asymmetric Convolutional Network (ACNet), which can be trained to reach a higher level of accuracy. After training, we equivalently convert the ACNet into the same original architecture, thus requiring no extra computations anymore. We have observed that ACNet can improve the performance of various models on CIFAR and ImageNet by a clear margin. Through further experiments, we attribute the effectiveness of ACB to its capability of enhancing the model's robustness to rotational distortions and strengthening the central skeleton parts of square convolution kernels."}

Our method, named DPOD (Dense Pose Object Detector), estimates dense multi-class 2D-3D correspondence maps between an input image and available 3D models. Given the correspondences, a 6DoF pose is computed via PnP and RANSAC. An additional RGB pose refinement of the initial pose estimates is performed using a custom deep learning-based refinement scheme. Our results and comparison to a vast number of related works demonstrate that a large number of correspondences is beneficial for obtaining high-quality 6D poses both before and after refinement. Unlike other methods that mainly use real data for training and do not train on synthetic renderings, we perform evaluation on both synthetic and real training data demonstrating superior results before and after refinement when compared to all recent detectors. While being precise, the presented approach is still real-time capable."}

The first stage is a bottom-up proposal generation network that uses raw point clouds as input to generate accurate proposals by seeding each point with a new spherical anchor. It achieves a higher recall with less computation compared with prior works. Then, PointsPool is applied for proposal feature generation by transforming interior point features from sparse expression to compact representation, which saves even more computation. In box prediction, which is the second stage, we implement a parallel intersection-over-union (IoU) branch to increase awareness of localization accuracy, resulting in further improved performance. We conduct experiments on KITTI dataset, and evaluate our method on 3D object and Bird's Eye View (BEV) detection.

We propose a Denoiser and UPsampler Network (DUP-Net) structure as defenses for 3D adversarial point cloud classification, where the two modules reconstruct surface smoothness by dropping or adding points. In this paper, statistical outlier removal (SOR) and a data-driven upsampling network are considered as denoiser and upsampler respectively. Compared with baseline defenses, DUP-Net has three advantages. First, with DUP-Net as a defense, the target model is more robust to white-box adversarial attacks. Second, the statistical outlier removal provides added robustness since it is a non-differentiable denoising operation. Third, the upsampler network can be trained on a small dataset and defends well against adversarial attacks generated from other point cloud datasets. We conduct various experiments to validate that DUP-Net is very effective as defense in practice. Our best defense eliminates 83.8% of C&W and l2 loss based attack (point shifting), 50.0% of C&W and Hausdorff distance loss based attack (point adding) and 9.0% of saliency map based attack (point dropping) under 200 dropped points on PointNet."}

Recent state-of-the-art methods adopt a 3D CNN stream to learn spatiotemporal features and another flow stream to learn motion features. In this work, we aim to efficiently encode these two features in a unified 2D framework. To this end, we first propose a STM block, which contains a Channel-wise SpatioTemporal Module (CSTM) to present the spatiotemporal features and a Channel-wise Motion Module (CMM) to efficiently encode motion features. We then replace original residual blocks in the ResNet architecture with STM blcoks to form a simple yet effective STM network by introducing very limited extra computation cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed STM network outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both temporal-related datasets (i.e., Something-Something v1 & v2 and Jester) and scene-related datasets (i.e., Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and HMDB-51) with the help of encoding spatiotemporal and motion features together."}

In contrast, humans and other embodied agents have the ability to move in the environment and actively control the viewing angle to better understand object shapes and semantics. In this work, we introduce the task of Embodied Amodel Recognition (EAR): an agent is instantiated in a 3D environment close to an occluded target object, and is free to move in the environment to perform object classification, amodal object localization, and amodal object segmentation. To address this problem, we develop a new model called Embodied Mask R-CNN for agents to learn to move strategically to improve their visual recognition abilities. We conduct experiments using a simulator for indoor environments. Experimental results show that: 1) agents with embodiment (movement) achieve better visual recognition performance than passive ones and 2) in order to improve visual recognition abilities, agents can learn strategic paths that are different from shortest paths."}

A chair may be \"behind\" a person even if it appears to the left of the person in the image (depending on which way the person is facing). Two students that appear close to each other in the image may not in fact be \"next to\" each other if there is a third student between them. We introduce SpatialSense, a dataset specializing in spatial relation recognition which captures a broad spectrum of such challenges, allowing for proper benchmarking of computer vision techniques. SpatialSense is constructed through adversarial crowdsourcing, in which human annotators are tasked with finding spatial relations that are difficult to predict using simple cues such as 2D spatial configuration or language priors. Adversarial crowdsourcing significantly reduces dataset bias and samples more interesting relations in the long tail compared to existing datasets. On SpatialSense, state-of-the-art recognition models perform comparably to simple baselines, suggesting that they rely on straightforward cues instead of fully reasoning about this complex task. The SpatialSense benchmark provides a path forward to advancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of computer vision systems. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/SpatialSense."}

In contrast, modern instance segmentation approaches are dominated by methods that first detect object bounding boxes, and then crop and segment these regions, as popularized by Mask R-CNN. In this work, we investigate the paradigm of dense sliding-window instance segmentation, which is surprisingly under-explored. Our core observation is that this task is fundamentally different than other dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation or bounding-box object detection, as the output at every spatial location is itself a geometric structure with its own spatial dimensions. To formalize this, we treat dense instance segmentation as a prediction task over 4D tensors and present a general framework called TensorMask that explicitly captures this geometry and enables novel operators on 4D tensors. We demonstrate that the tensor view leads to large gains over baselines that ignore this structure, and leads to results comparable to Mask R-CNN. These promising results suggest that TensorMask can serve as a foundation for novel advances in dense mask prediction and a more complete understanding of the task. Code will be made available."}

The segmentation network is trained without any information about target domains and tested on the unseen target domains. To this end, we propose a new approach of domain randomization and pyramid consistency to learn a model with high generalizability. First, we propose to randomize the synthetic images with styles of real images in terms of visual appearances using auxiliary datasets, in order to effectively learn domain-invariant representations. Second, we further enforce pyramid consistency across different \"stylized\" images and within an image, in order to learn domain-invariant and scale-invariant features, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted on generalization from GTA and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, BDDS, and Mapillary; and our method achieves superior results over the state-of-the-art techniques. Remarkably, our generalization results are on par with or even better than those obtained by state-of-the-art simulation-to-real domain adaptation methods, which access the target domain data at training time."}

However, neural classifiers are often extremely brittle when confronted with domain shift---changes in the input distribution that occur over time. We present ACE, a framework for semantic segmentation that dynamically adapts to changing environments over time. By aligning the distribution of labeled training data from the original source domain with the distribution of incoming data in a shifted domain, ACE synthesizes labeled training data for environments as it sees them. This stylized data is then used to update a segmentation model so that it performs well in new environments. To avoid forgetting knowledge from past environments, we introduce a memory that stores feature statistics from previously seen domains. These statistics can be used to replay images in any of the previously observed domains, thus preventing catastrophic forgetting. In addition to standard batch training using stochastic gradient decent (SGD), we also experiment with fast adaptation methods based on adaptive meta-learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets from SYNTHIA, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach when adapting to a number of tasks."}

To speed up performance, it is common to downsample the input frame. However, this comes at the cost of missed small objects and reduced accuracy at semantic boundaries. To address this problem, we propose a new content-adaptive downsampling technique that learns to favor sampling locations near semantic boundaries of target classes. Cost-performance analysis shows that our method consistently outperforms the uniform sampling improving balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Our adaptive sampling gives segmentation with better quality of boundaries and more reliable support for smaller-size objects."}

In contrast to previous methods that predict 3D poses independently of the focal length or assume a constant focal length, we explicitly estimate and integrate the focal length into the 3D pose estimation. For this purpose, we combine deep learning techniques and geometric algorithms in a two-stage approach: First, we estimate an initial focal length and establish 2D-3D correspondences from a single RGB image using a deep network. Second, we recover 3D poses and refine the focal length by minimizing the reprojection error of the predicted correspondences. In this way, we exploit the geometric prior given by the focal length for 3D pose estimation. This results in two advantages: First, we achieve significantly improved 3D translation and 3D pose accuracy compared to existing methods. Second, our approach finds a geometric consensus between the individual projection parameters, which is required for precise 2D-3D alignment. We evaluate our proposed approach on three challenging real-world datasets (Pix3D, Comp, and Stanford) with different object categories and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art by up to 20% absolute in multiple different metrics."}

While the recent progress in convolutional neural networks has allowed impressive results for 3D human pose estimation, estimating the full 3D shape of a person is still an open issue. Model-based approaches can output precise meshes of naked under-cloth human bodies but fail to estimate details and un-modelled elements such as hair or clothing. On the other hand, non-parametric volumetric approaches can potentially estimate complete shapes but, in practice, they are limited by the resolution of the output grid and cannot produce detailed estimates. In this work, we propose a non-parametric approach that employs a double depth map to represent the 3D shape of a person: a visible depth map and a \"hidden\" depth map are estimated and combined, to reconstruct the human 3D shape as done with a \"mould\". This representation through 2D depth maps allows a higher resolution output with a much lower dimension than voxel-based volumetric representations. Additionally, our fully derivable depth-based model allows us to efficiently incorporate a discriminator in an adversarial fashion to improve the accuracy and \"humanness\" of the 3D output. We train and quantitatively validate our approach on SURREAL and on 3D-HUMANS, a new photorealistic dataset made of semi-synthetic in-house videos annotated with 3D ground truth surfaces."}

In this paper, we present an approach to model dressed humans and predict their geometry from single images. We contribute in three fundamental aspects of the problem, namely, a new dataset, a novel shape parameterization algorithm and an end-to-end deep generative network for predicting shape. First, we present 3DPeople, a large-scale synthetic dataset with 2 Million photo-realistic images of 80 subjects performing 70 activities and wearing diverse outfits. Besides providing textured 3D meshes for clothes and body we annotated the dataset with segmentation masks, skeletons, depth, normal maps and optical flow. All this together makes 3DPeople suitable for a plethora of tasks. We then represent the 3D shapes using 2D geometry images. To build these images we propose a novel spherical area-preserving parameterization algorithm based on the optimal mass transportation method. We show this approach to improve existing spherical maps which tend to shrink the elongated parts of the full body models such as the arms and legs, making the geometry images incomplete. Finally, we design a multi-resolution deep generative network that, given an input image of a dressed human, predicts his/her geometry image (and thus the clothed body shape) in an end-to-end manner. We obtain very promising results in jointly capturing body pose and clothing shape, both for synthetic validation and on the wild images."}

Our model can infer full-body shape including face, hair, and clothing including wrinkles at interactive frame-rates. Results feature details even on parts that are occluded in the input image. Our main idea is to turn shape regression into an aligned image-to-image translation problem. The input to our method is a partial texture map of the visible region obtained from off-the-shelf methods. From a partial texture, we estimate detailed normal and vector displacement maps, which can be applied to a low-resolution smooth body model to add detail and clothing. Despite being trained purely with synthetic data, our model generalizes well to real-world photographs. Numerous results demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our method."}

Using PIFu, we propose an end-to-end deep learning method for digitizing highly detailed clothed humans that can infer both 3D surface and texture from a single image, and optionally, multiple input images. Highly intricate shapes, such as hairstyles, clothing, as well as their variations and deformations can be digitized in a unified way. Compared to existing representations used for 3D deep learning, PIFu produces high-resolution surfaces including largely unseen regions such as the back of a person. In particular, it is memory efficient unlike the voxel representation, can handle arbitrary topology, and the resulting surface is spatially aligned with the input image. Furthermore, while previous techniques are designed to process either a single image or multiple views, PIFu extends naturally to arbitrary number of views. We demonstrate high-resolution and robust reconstructions on real world images from the DeepFashion dataset, which contains a variety of challenging clothing types. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public benchmark and outperforms the prior work for clothed human digitization from a single image."}

This paper proposes a deep Dense-Fine-Finer Network (DF2Net) to address this challenging problem. DF2Net decomposes the reconstruction process into three stages, each of which is processed by an elaborately-designed network, namely D-Net, F-Net, and Fr-Net. D-Net exploits a U-net architecture to map the input image to a dense depth image. F-Net refines the output of D-Net by integrating features from depth and RGB domains, whose output is further enhanced by Fr-Net with a novel multi-resolution hypercolumn architecture. In addition, we introduce three types of data to train these networks, including 3D model synthetic data, 2D image reconstructed data, and fine facial images. We elaborately exploit different datasets (or combination) together with well-designed losses to train different networks. Qualitative evaluation indicates that our DF2Net can effectively reconstruct subtle facial details such as small crow's feet and wrinkles.

This work attempts to address the uncertainty of lifting the detected 2D joints to the 3D space by introducing an intermediate state - Part-Centric Heatmap Triplets (HEMlets), which shortens the gap between the 2D observation and the 3D interpretation. The HEMlets utilize three joint-heatmaps to represent the relative depth information of the end-joints for each skeletal body part. In our approach, a Convolutional Network(ConvNet) is first trained to predict HEMlests from the input image, followed by a volumetric joint-heatmap regression. We leverage on the integral operation to extract the joint locations from the volumetric heatmaps, guaranteeing end-to-end learning. Despite the simplicity of the network design, the quantitative comparisons show a significant performance improvement over the best-of-grade method (by 20% on Human3.6M). The proposed method naturally supports training with \"in-the-wild\" images, where only weakly-annotated relative depth information of skeletal joints is available. This further improves the generalization ability of our model, as validated by qualitative comparisons on outdoor images."}

It combines tools from recurrent sequence modeling and variational deep generative modeling to produce a distribution of future trajectories for each agent in a scene.

In this work, we present a novel robust and real-time long-term tracking framework based on the proposed skimming and perusal modules. The perusal module consists of an effective bounding box regressor to generate a series of candidate proposals and a robust target verifier to infer the optimal candidate with its confidence score. Based on this score, our tracker determines whether the tracked object being present or absent, and then chooses the tracking strategies of local search or global search respectively in the next frame. To speed up the image-wide global search, a novel skimming module is designed to efficiently choose the most possible regions from a large number of sliding windows. Numerous experimental results on the VOT-2018 long-term and OxUvA long-term benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best performance and runs in real-time.

It consists of two building blocks: first, the encoder network extracts low-resolution spatiotemporal features from an input clip of several consecutive frames, and then the following prediction network decodes the encoded features spatially while aggregating all the temporal information. As a result, a single prediction map is produced from an input clip of multiple frames. Frame-wise saliency maps can be predicted by applying TASED-Net in a sliding-window fashion to a video. The proposed approach assumes that the saliency map of any frame can be predicted by considering a limited number of past frames. The results of our extensive experiments on video saliency detection validate this assumption and demonstrate that our fully-convolutional model with temporal aggregation method is effective. TASED-Net significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on all three major large-scale datasets of video saliency detection: DHF1K, Hollywood2, and UCFSports. After analyzing the results qualitatively, we observe that our model is especially better at attending to salient moving objects."}

We first reconstruct the 3D points while estimating the poses of the camera and the projector, which are alternately moved around the object, by combining multi-view structured light and structure-from-motion (SfM) techniques. We then exploit the projector for multispectral imaging and estimate the spectral reflectance of each 3D point based on a novel spectral reflectance estimation model considering the geometric relationship between the reconstructed 3D points and the estimated projector positions.

However, directly employing adversarial learning and cycle-consistency constraints is insufficient to learn the underlying relationship between the shadow and shadow-free domains, since the mapping between shadow and shadow-free images is not simply one-to-one. To address the problem, we formulate Mask-ShadowGAN, a new deep framework that automatically learns to produce a shadow mask from the input shadow image and then takes the mask to guide the shadow generation via re-formulated cycle-consistency constraints. Particularly, the framework simultaneously learns to produce shadow masks and learns to remove shadows, to maximize the overall performance. Also, we prepared an unpaired dataset for shadow removal and demonstrated the effectiveness of Mask-ShadowGAN on various experiments, even it was trained on unpaired data."}

In contrast to previous work on image memorability -- where memorability was measured a few minutes after memorization -- memory performance is measured twice: a few minutes and again 24-72 hours after memorization. Hence, the dataset comes with short-term and long-term memorability annotations.

We propose an algorithm that analyzes these \"rescans\" to infer a temporal model of a scene with semantic instance information. Our algorithm operates inductively by using the temporal model resulting from past observations to infer an instance segmentation of a new scan, which is then used to update the temporal model. The model contains object instance associations across time and thus can be used to track individual objects, even though there are only sparse observations. During experiments with a new benchmark for the new task, our algorithm outperforms alternate approaches based on state-of-the-art networks for semantic instance segmentation."}

Given a triplet: an image, Q&A history, and current question, all the prevailing methods follow a codec (i.e., encoder-decoder) fashion in a supervised learning paradigm: a multimodal encoder encodes the triplet into a feature vector, which is then fed into the decoder for the current answer generation, supervised by the ground-truth. However, this conventional supervised learning does NOT take into account the impact of imperfect history, violating the conversational nature of visual dialog and thus making the codec more inclined to learn history bias but not contextual reasoning. To this end, inspired by the actor-critic policy gradient in reinforcement learning, we propose a novel training paradigm called History Advantage Sequence Training (HAST). Specifically, we intentionally impose wrong answers in the history, obtaining an adverse critic, and see how the historic error impacts the codec's future behavior by History Advantage -- a quantity obtained by subtracting the adverse critic from the gold reward of ground-truth history. Moreover, to make the codec more sensitive to the history, we propose a novel attention network called History-Aware Co-Attention Network (HACAN) which can be effectively trained by using HAST. Experimental results on three benchmarks: VisDial v0.9&v1.0 and GuessWhat?!, show that the proposed HAST strategy consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised counterparts."}

In this work, we propose a generic approach called Human Importance-aware Network Tuning (HINT) that effectively leverages human demonstrations to improve visual grounding. HINT encourages deep networks to be sensitive to the same input regions as humans. Our approach optimizes the alignment between human attention maps and gradient-based network importances -- ensuring that models learn not just to look at but rather rely on visual concepts that humans found relevant for a task when making predictions. We apply HINT to Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning tasks, outperforming top approaches on splits that penalize over-reliance on language priors (VQA-CP and robust captioning) using human attention demonstrations for just 6% of the training data."}

We propose a novel end-to-end model that uses caption-to-image retrieval as a downstream task to guide the process of phrase localization. Our method, as a first step, infers the latent correspondences between regions-of-interest (RoIs) and phrases in the caption and creates a discriminative image representation using these matched RoIs. In the subsequent step, this learned representation is aligned with the caption. Our key contribution lies in building this \"caption-conditioned\" image encoding, which tightly couples both the tasks and allows the weak supervision to effectively guide visual grounding. We provide extensive empirical and qualitative analysis to investigate the different components of our proposed model and compare it with competitive baselines. For phrase localization, we report an improvement of 4.9% and 1.3% (absolute) over the prior state-of-the-art on the VisualGenome and Flickr30k Entities datasets. We also report results that are at par with the state-of-the-art on the downstream caption-to-image retrieval task on COCO and Flickr30k datasets."}

However, such datasets are expensive and time consuming to create and therefore difficult to obtain on a large scale. In this work, we propose instead to learn such embeddings from video data with readily available natural language annotations in the form of automatically transcribed narrations. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we introduce HowTo100M: a large-scale dataset of 136 million video clips sourced from 1.22M narrated instructional web videos depicting humans performing and describing over 23k different visual tasks. Our data collection procedure is fast, scalable and does not require any additional manual annotation. Second, we demonstrate that a text-video embedding trained on this data leads to state-of-the-art results for text-to-video retrieval and action localization on instructional video datasets such as YouCook2 or CrossTask. Finally, we show that this embedding transfers well to other domains: fine-tuning on generic Youtube videos (MSR-VTT dataset) and movies (LSMDC dataset) outperforms models trained on these datasets alone.

The approach, dubbed Floor-SP, formulates a novel optimization problem, where room-wise coordinate descent sequentially solves shortest path problems to optimize the floorplan graph structure. The objective function consists of data terms guided by deep neural networks, consistency terms encouraging adjacent rooms to share corners and walls, and the model complexity term. The approach does not require corner/edge primitive extraction unlike most other methods. We have evaluated our system on production-quality RGBD scans of 527 apartments or houses, including many units with non-Manhattan structures.

Several mainstream works (e.g., 3D-R2N2) use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to fuse multiple feature maps extracted from input images sequentially. However, when given the same set of input images with different orders, RNN-based approaches are unable to produce consistent reconstruction results. Moreover, due to long-term memory loss, RNNs cannot fully exploit input images to refine reconstruction results. To solve these problems, we propose a novel framework for single-view and multi-view 3D reconstruction, named Pix2Vox. By using a well-designed encoder-decoder, it generates a coarse 3D volume from each input image. Then, a context-aware fusion module is introduced to adaptively select high-quality reconstructions for each part (e.g., table legs) from different coarse 3D volumes to obtain a fused 3D volume. Finally, a refiner further refines the fused 3D volume to generate the final output. Experimental results on the ShapeNet and Pix3D benchmarks indicate that the proposed Pix2Vox outperforms state-of-the-arts by a large margin. Furthermore, the proposed method is 24 times faster than 3D-R2N2 in terms of backward inference time. The experiments on ShapeNet unseen 3D categories have shown the superior generalization abilities of our method."}

Although such objective functions generate near-photorealistic results, their capability is limited, since they estimate the reconstruction error for an entire image in the same way, without considering any semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel method to benefit from perceptual loss in a more objective way. We optimize a deep network-based decoder with a targeted objective function that penalizes images at different semantic levels using the corresponding terms. In particular, the proposed method leverages our proposed OBB (Object, Background and Boundary) labels, generated from segmentation labels, to estimate a suitable perceptual loss for boundaries, while considering texture similarity for backgrounds. We show that our proposed approach results in more realistic textures and sharper edges, and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both qualitative results on standard benchmarks and results of extensive user studies."}

Training an unpaired synthetic-to-real translation network in image space is severely under-constrained and produces visible artifacts. Instead, we propose a semi-supervised approach that operates on the disentangled shading and albedo layers of the image. Our two-stage pipeline first learns to predict accurate shading in a supervised fashion using physically-based renderings as targets, and further increases the realism of the textures and shading with an improved CycleGAN network. Extensive evaluations on the SUNCG indoor scene dataset demonstrate that our approach yields more realistic images compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, networks trained on our generated \"real\" images predict more accurate depth and normals than domain adaptation approaches, suggesting that improving the visual realism of the images can be more effective than imposing task-specific losses."}

Catastrophic forgetting occurs when a trained network is not able to maintain its ability to accomplish previously learned tasks when it is trained to perform new tasks. We study the problem of lifelong learning for generative models, extending a trained network to new conditional generation tasks without forgetting previous tasks, while assuming access to the training data for the current task only. In contrast to state-of-the-art memory replay based approaches which are limited to label-conditioned image generation tasks, a more generic framework for continual learning of generative models under different conditional image generation settings is proposed in this paper. Lifelong GAN employs knowledge distillation to transfer learned knowledge from previous networks to the new network. This makes it possible to perform image-conditioned generation tasks in a lifelong learning setting. We validate Lifelong GAN for both image-conditioned and label-conditioned generation tasks, and provide qualitative and quantitative results to show the generality and effectiveness of our method."}

These methods are traditionally based on a temporal series of stereo images. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular 3D scene flow estimation method, called Mono-SF. Mono-SF jointly estimates the 3D structure and motion of the scene by combining multi-view geometry and single-view depth information. Mono-SF considers that the scene flow should be consistent in terms of warping the reference image in the consecutive image based on the principles of multi-view geometry. For integrating single-view depth in a statistical manner, a convolutional neural network, called ProbDepthNet, is proposed. ProbDepthNet estimates pixel-wise depth distributions from a single image rather than single depth values. Additionally, as part of ProbDepthNet, a novel recalibration technique for regression problems is proposed to ensure well-calibrated distributions. Our experiments show that Mono-SF outperforms state-of-the-art monocular baselines and ablation studies support the Mono-SF approach and ProbDepthNet design."}

Towards these capabilities, we present a probabilistic forecasting model of future interactions between a variable number of agents. We perform both standard forecasting and the novel task of conditional forecasting, which reasons about how all agents will likely respond to the goal of a controlled agent (here, the AV). We train models on real and simulated data to forecast vehicle trajectories given past positions and LIDAR. Our evaluation shows that our model is substantially more accurate in multi-agent driving scenarios compared to existing state-of-the-art. Beyond its general ability to perform conditional forecasting queries, we show that our model's predictions of all agents improve when conditioned on knowledge of the AV's goal, further illustrating its capability to model agent interactions."}

In this paper, we develop a novel deep neural network, named LPD-Net (Large-scale Place Description Network), which can extract discriminative and generalizable global descriptors from the raw 3D point cloud. Two modules, the adaptive local feature extraction module and the graph-based neighborhood aggregation module, are proposed, which contribute to extract the local structures and reveal the spatial distribution of local features in the large-scale point cloud, with an end-to-end manner. We implement the proposed global descriptor in solving point cloud based retrieval tasks to achieve the large-scale place recognition. Comparison results show that our LPD-Net is much better than PointNetVLAD and reaches the state-of-the-art. We also compare our LPD-Net with the vision-based solutions to show the robustness of our approach to different weather and light conditions."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2019", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Local Supports Global", "Title": "Deep Camera Relocalization With Sequence Enhancement", "Abstract": "We propose to leverage the local information in a image sequence to support global camera relocalization. In contrast to previous methods that regress global poses from single images, we exploit the spatial-temporal consistency in sequential images to alleviate uncertainty due to visual ambiguities by incorporating a visual odometry (VO) component. Specifically, we introduce two effective steps called content-augmented pose estimation and motion-based refinement. The content-augmentation step focuses on alleviating the uncertainty of pose estimation by augmenting the observation based on the co-visibility in local maps built by the VO stream. Besides, the motion-based refinement is formulated as a pose graph, where the camera poses are further optimized by adopting relative poses provided by the VO component as additional motion constraints. Thus, the global consistency can be guaranteed. Experiments on the public indoor 7-Scenes and outdoor Oxford RobotCar benchmark datasets demonstrate that benefited from local information inherent in the sequence, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in some challenging cases, e.g., insufficient texture, highly repetitive textures, similar appearances, and over-exposure."}

Sparse feature and deep learning based methods have been successful and dominant over the decade. However, most of them do not explicitly leverage high-level semantic information to deal with challenging scenarios where they may fail. This paper proposes a novel visual place recognition algorithm, termed TextPlace, based on scene texts in the wild. Since scene texts are high-level information invariant to illumination changes and very distinct for different places when considering spatial correlation, it is beneficial for visual place recognition tasks under extreme appearance changes and perceptual aliasing. It also takes spatial-temporal dependence between scene texts into account for topological localization. Extensive experiments show that TextPlace achieves state-of-the-art performance, verifying the effectiveness of using high-level scene texts for robust visual place recognition in urban areas."}

Recently, retrieval-based methods have been considered as a promising direction as they can be easily generalized to novel scenes. Despite significant progress has been made, we observe that the performance bottleneck of previous methods actually lies in the retrieval module. These methods use the same features for both retrieval and relative pose regression tasks which have potential conflicts in learning. To this end, here we present a coarse-to-fine retrieval-based deep learning framework, which includes three steps, i.e., image-based coarse retrieval, pose-based fine retrieval and precise relative pose regression. With our carefully designed retrieval module, the relative pose regression task can be surprisingly simpler. We design novel retrieval losses with batch hard sampling criterion and two-stage retrieval to locate samples that adapt to the relative pose regression task. Extensive experiments show that our model (CamNet) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on both indoor and outdoor datasets."}

Current attempts to automate this pro- cess typically focus on simple scenarios, estimate independent maps per frame or do not have the level of precision required by modern self driving vehicles. In contrast, in this paper we focus on drawing the lane boundaries of complex highways with many lanes that contain topology changes due to forks and merges. Towards this goal, we formulate the problem as inference in a directed acyclic graphical model (DAG), where the nodes of the graph encode geo- metric and topological properties of the local regions of the lane boundaries. Since we do not know a priori the topology of the lanes, we also infer the DAG topology (i.e., nodes and edges) for each region. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two major North American Highways in two different states and show high precision and recall as well as 89% correct topology."}

This work marks a first attempt to address this task with on-board sensing without assuming a known constant lane width or relying on pre-mapped environments. Our network architecture, 3D-LaneNet, applies two new concepts: intra-network inverse-perspective mapping (IPM) and anchor-based lane representation. The intra-network IPM projection facilitates a dual-representation information flow in both regular image-view and top-view. An anchor-per-column output representation enables our end-to-end approach which replaces common heuristics such as clustering and outlier rejection, casting lane estimation as an object detection problem. In addition, our approach explicitly handles complex situations such as lane merges and splits. Results are shown on two new 3D lane datasets, a synthetic and a real one. For comparison with existing methods, we test our approach on the image-only tuSimple lane detection benchmark, achieving performance competitive with state-of-the-art."}

Based on the first optimization-based attacking method, many following methods are proposed to improve the attacking performance and speed. Recently, generation-based methods have received much attention since they directly use feed-forward networks to generate the adversarial samples, which avoid the time-consuming iterative attacking procedure in optimization-based and gradient-based methods. However, current generation-based methods are only able to attack one specific target (category) within one model, thus making them not applicable to real classification systems that often have hundreds/thousands of categories. In this paper, we propose the first Multi-target Adversarial Network (MAN), which can generate multi-target adversarial samples with a single model. By incorporating the specified category information into the intermediate features, it can attack any category of the target classification model during runtime. Experiments show that the proposed MAN can produce stronger attack results and also have better transferability than previous state-of-the-art methods in both multi-target attack task and single-target attack task. We further use the adversarial samples generated by our MAN to improve the robustness of the classification model. It can also achieve better classification accuracy than other methods when attacked by various methods."}

By advancing adversarial learning techniques, our proposed model learns resolution-invariant image representations while being able to recover the missing details in low-resolution input images. The resulting features can be jointly applied for improving person re-ID performance due to preserving resolution invariance and recovering re-ID oriented discriminative details. Our experiments on five benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods, especially when the input resolutions are unseen during training."}

While many recent attempts at factor disentanglement have focused on sophisticated learning objectives within the VAE framework, their choice of a standard normal as the latent factor prior is both suboptimal and detrimental to performance. Our key observation is that the disentangled latent variables responsible for major sources of variability, the relevant factors, can be more appropriately modeled using long-tail distributions. The typical Gaussian priors are, on the other hand, better suited for modeling of nuisance factors. Motivated by this, we extend the VAE to a hierarchical Bayesian model by introducing hyper-priors on the variances of Gaussian latent priors, mimicking an infinite mixture, while maintaining tractable learning and inference of the traditional VAEs. This analysis signifies the importance of partitioning and treating in a different manner the latent dimensions corresponding to relevant factors and nuisances. Our proposed models, dubbed Bayes-Factor-VAEs, are shown to outperform existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of latent disentanglement across several challenging benchmark tasks."}

Its design is critical for dense prediction tasks such as object detection and semantic/instance segmentation. In this work, we propose Content-Aware ReAssembly of FEatures (CARAFE), a universal, lightweight and highly effective operator to fulfill this goal. CARAFE has several appealing properties: (1) Large field of view. Unlike previous works (e.g. bilinear interpolation) that only exploit subpixel neighborhood, CARAFE can aggregate contextual information within a large receptive field. (2) Content-aware handling. Instead of using a fixed kernel for all samples (e.g. deconvolution), CARAFE enables instance-specific content-aware handling, which generates adaptive kernels on-the-fly. (3) Lightweight and fast to compute. CARAFE introduces little computational overhead and can be readily integrated into modern network architectures. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks in object detection, instance/semantic segmentation and inpainting. CARAFE shows consistent and substantial gains across all the tasks (1.2% AP, 1.3% AP, 1.8% mIoU, 1.1dB respectively) with negligible computational overhead. It has great potential to serve as a strong building block for future research. Code and models are available at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection."}

We consider the reason is twofold: 1. the weaker discriminative feature learned by conventional methods; 2. the significant appearance difference between two images domains. To tackle these problems, we propose an aggregated feature difference learning network (AFD-Net). Unlike other methods that merely rely on the high-level features, we find the feature differences in other levels also provide useful learning information. Thus, the multi-level feature differences are aggregated to enhance the discrimination. To make features invariant across different domains, we introduce a domain invariant feature extraction network based on instance normalization (IN). In order to optimize the AFD-Net, we borrow the large margin cosine loss which can minimize intra-class distance and maximize inter-class distance between matching and non-matching samples. Extensive experiments show that AFD-Net largely outperforms the state-of-the-arts on the cross-spectral dataset, meanwhile, demonstrates a considerable generalizability on a single spectral dataset."}

In this paper, we build a real-world super-resolution (RealSR) dataset where paired LR-HR images on the same scene are captured by adjusting the focal length of a digital camera. An image registration algorithm is developed to progressively align the image pairs at different resolutions. Considering that the degradation kernels are naturally non-uniform in our dataset, we present a Laplacian pyramid based kernel prediction network (LP-KPN), which efficiently learns per-pixel kernels to recover the HR image. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SISR models trained on our RealSR dataset deliver better visual quality with sharper edges and finer textures on real-world scenes than those trained on simulated datasets. Though our RealSR dataset is built by using only two cameras (Canon 5D3 and Nikon D810), the trained model generalizes well to other camera devices such as Sony a7II and mobile phones."}

To further improve the visual quality of super-resolved results, PIRM2018-SR Challenge employed perceptual metrics to assess the perceptual quality, such as PI, NIQE, and Ma. However, existing methods cannot directly optimize these indifferentiable perceptual metrics, which are shown to be highly correlated with human ratings. To address the problem, we propose Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks with Ranker (RankSRGAN) to optimize generator in the direction of perceptual metrics. Specifically, we first train a Ranker which can learn the behavior of perceptual metrics and then introduce a novel rank-content loss to optimize the perceptual quality. The most appealing part is that the proposed method can combine the strengths of different SR methods to generate better results. Extensive experiments show that RankSRGAN achieves visually pleasing results and reaches state-of-the-art performance in perceptual metrics.

Consequently, UHD HDR broadcasting and streaming have emerged as high quality premium services. However, due to the lack of original UHD HDR video content, appropriate conversion technologies are urgently needed to transform the legacy low resolution (LR) standard dynamic range (SDR) videos into UHD HDR versions. In this paper, we propose a joint super-resolution (SR) and inverse tone-mapping (ITM) framework, called Deep SR-ITM, which learns the direct mapping from LR SDR video to their HR HDR version. Joint SR and ITM is an intricate task, where high frequency details must be restored for SR, jointly with the local contrast, for ITM. Our network is able to restore fine details by decomposing the input image and focusing on the separate base (low frequency) and detail (high frequency) layers. Moreover, the proposed modulation blocks apply location-variant operations to enhance local contrast. The Deep SR-ITM shows good subjective quality with increased contrast and details, outperforming the previous joint SR-ITM method."}

Our approach leverages state-of-the-art single-image compression autoencoders and enhances the compression with novel parametric skip functions to feed fully differentiable, disparity-warped features at all levels to the encoder/decoder of the second image. Moreover, we model the probabilistic dependence between the image codes using a conditional entropy model.

The long-standing additive white Gaussian and heteroscedastic (signal-dependent) noise models widely used in the literature provide only a coarse approximation of real sensor noise. This paper introduces Noise Flow, a powerful and accurate noise model based on recent normalizing flow architectures. Noise Flow combines well-established basic parametric noise models (e.g., signal-dependent noise) with the flexibility and expressiveness of normalizing flow networks. The result is a single, comprehensive, compact noise model containing fewer than 2500 parameters yet able to represent multiple cameras and gain factors. Noise Flow dramatically outperforms existing noise models, with 0.42 nats/pixel improvement over the camera-calibrated noise level functions, which translates to 52% improvement in the likelihood of sampled noise. Noise Flow represents the first serious attempt to go beyond simple parametric models to one that leverages the power of deep learning and data-driven noise distributions."}

Our key insight is that sharing features makes the network more compact, induces better feature representations, and can better exploit interactions among these tasks to handle partially labeled data. With a shared encoder, we can flexibly add decoders for different tasks during training. This modular design leads to a compact and efficient model at inference time. Exploiting the interactions among these tasks allows us to introduce distillation and self-supervised losses in addition to supervised losses, which can better handle partially labeled real-world data. SENSE achieves state-of-the-art results on several optical flow benchmarks and runs as fast as networks specifically designed for optical flow. It also compares favorably against the state of the art on stereo and scene flow, while consuming much less memory."}

To date, the objective is fixed a-priori at training time, and any variation to it requires re-training a new network. In this paper we present a first attempt at alleviating the need for re-training. Rather than fixing the network at training time, we train a \"Dynamic-Net\" that can be modified at inference time. Our approach considers an \"objective-space\" as the space of all linear combinations of two objectives, and the Dynamic-Net is emulating the traversing of this objective-space at test-time, without any further training. We show that this upgrades pre-trained networks by providing an out-of-learning extension, while maintaining the performance quality. The solution we propose is fast and allows a user to interactively modify the network, in real-time, in order to obtain the result he/she desires. We show the benefits of such an approach via several different applications."}

We define the search space for the generator architectural variations and use an RNN controller to guide the search, with parameter sharing and dynamic-resetting to accelerate the process. Inception score is adopted as the reward, and a multi-level search strategy is introduced to perform NAS in a progressive way. Experiments validate the effectiveness of AutoGAN on the task of unconditional image generation.

This notion is inspired by an observation in the decoding process of deep image matting where indices-guided unpooling can often recover boundary details considerably better than other upsampling operators such as bilinear interpolation. By viewing the indices as a function of the feature map, we introduce the concept of 'learning to index', and present a novel index-guided encoder-decoder framework where indices are self-learned adaptively from data and are used to guide the pooling and upsampling operators, without extra training supervision. At the core of this framework is a flexible network module, termed IndexNet, which dynamically generates indices conditioned on the feature map. Due to its flexibility, IndexNet can be used as a plug-in applying to almost all off-the-shelf convolutional networks that have coupled downsampling and upsampling stages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndexNet on the task of natural image matting where the quality of learned indices can be visually observed from predicted alpha mattes. Results on the Composition-1k matting dataset show that our model built on MobileNetv2 exhibits at least 16.1% improvement over the seminal VGG-16 based deep matting baseline, with less training data and lower model capacity.

Unlike previous multi-stage algorithms that generally learn in a coarse-to-fine fashion, each stage of LAP-Net learns different levels of haze with different supervision. Then the network can progressively learn the gradually aggravating haze. With this design, each stage can focus on a region with specific haze level and restore clear details. To effectively fuse the results of varying haze levels at different stages, we develop an adaptive integration strategy to yield the final dehazed image. This strategy is achieved by a hierarchical integration scheme, which is in cooperation with the memory network and the domain knowledge of dehazing to highlight the best-restored regions of each stage. Extensive experiments on both real-world images and two dehazing benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method."}

We first train a PruningNet, a kind of meta network, which is able to generate weight parameters for any pruned structure given the target network. We use a simple stochastic structure sampling method for training the PruningNet. Then, we apply an evolutionary procedure to search for good-performing pruned networks. The search is highly efficient because the weights are directly generated by the trained PruningNet and we do not need any finetuning at search time. With a single PruningNet trained for the target network, we can search for various Pruned Networks under different constraints with little human participation. Compared to the state-of-the-art pruning methods, we have demonstrated superior performances on MobileNet V1/V2 and ResNet. Codes are available on https://github.com/liuzechun/MetaPruning."}

In this paper, we present Harmonious Bottleneck on two Orthogonal dimensions (HBO), a novel architecture unit, specially tailored to boost the accuracy of extremely lightweight MobileNets at the level of less than 40 MFLOPs. Unlike existing bottleneck designs that mainly focus on exploring the interdependencies among the channels of either groupwise or depthwise convolutional features, our HBO improves bottleneck representation while maintaining similar complexity via jointly encoding the feature interdependencies across both spatial and channel dimensions. It has two reciprocal components, namely spatial contraction-expansion and channel expansion-contraction, nested in a bilaterally symmetric structure. The combination of two interdependent transformations performing on orthogonal dimensions of feature maps enhances the representation and generalization ability of our proposed module, guaranteeing compelling performance with limited computational resource and power. By replacing the original bottlenecks in MobileNetV2 backbone with HBO modules, we construct HBONets which are evaluated on ImageNet classification, PASCAL VOC object detection and Market-1501 person re-identification. Extensive experiments show that with the severe constraint of computational budget our models outperform MobileNetV2 counterparts by remarkable margins of at most 6.6%, 6.3% and 5.0% on the above benchmarks respectively.

Different from prior work which requires specifically designed noise-robust loss functions or networks, O2U-net is easy to implement but effective. It only requires adjusting the hyper-parameters of the deep network to make its status transfer from overfitting to underfitting (O2U) cyclically. The losses of each sample are recorded during iterations. The higher the normalized average loss of a sample, the higher the probability of being noisy labels. O2U-net is naturally compatible with active learning and other human annotation approaches. This introduces extra flexibility for learning with noisy labels. We conduct sufficient experiments on multiple datasets in various settings. The experimental results prove the state-of-the-art of O2S-net."}

Unlike previous methods which are composed of multiple offline stages, we propose Sequential Label Propagation and Enhancement Networks (referred as Label-PEnet) that progressively transforms image-level labels to pixel-wise labels in a coarse-to-fine manner. We design four cascaded modules including multi-label classification, object detection, instance refinement and instance segmentation, which are implemented sequentially by sharing the same backbone. The cascaded pipeline is trained alternatively with a curriculum learning strategy that generalizes labels from high level images to low-level pixels gradually with increasing accuracy. In addition, we design a proposal calibration module to explore the ability of classification networks to find key pixels that identify object parts, which serves as a post validation strategy running in the inverse order. We evaluate the efficiency of our Label-PEnet in mining instance masks on standard benchmarks: PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012. Experimental results show that Label-PEnet outperforms the state-of-art algorithms by a clear margin, and obtains comparable performance even with fully supervised approaches."}

However, for discriminative tasks, there is a possibility that these layers lose the discriminative details due to improper pooling strategies, which could hinder the learning process and eventually result in suboptimal models. In this paper, we present a unified framework over the existing downsampling layers (e.g., average pooling, max pooling, and strided convolution) from a local importance view. In this framework, we analyze the issues of these widely-used pooling layers and figure out the criteria for designing an effective downsampling layer. According to this analysis, we propose a conceptually simple, general, and effective pooling layer based on local importance modeling, termed as Local Importance-based Pooling (LIP). LIP can automatically enhance discriminative features during the downsampling procedure by learning adaptive importance weights based on inputs. Experiment results show that LIP consistently yields notable gains with different depths and different architectures on ImageNet classification. In the challenging MS COCO dataset, detectors with our LIP-ResNets as backbones obtain a consistent improvement (>=1.4%) over the vanilla ResNets, and especially achieve the current state-of-the-art performance in detecting small objects under the single-scale testing scheme."}

Taking advantage of the condensed features of hyperpixels, we develop an effective real-time matching algorithm based on Hough geometric voting.

In this paper, we explore the idea of hard attention aimed for latency-sensitive applications. Instead of reasoning about every frame separately, our method selects and only processes a small sub-window of the frame. Our technique then makes predictions for the full frame based on the sub-windows from previous frames and the update from the current sub-window. The latency reduction by this hard attention mechanism comes at the cost of degraded accuracy. We made two contributions to address this. First, we propose a specialized memory cell that recovers lost context when processing sub-windows. Secondly, we adopt a Q-learning-based policy training strategy that enables our approach to intelligently select the sub-windows such that the staleness in the memory hurts the performance the least. Our experiments suggest that our approach reduces the latency by approximately four times without significantly sacrificing the accuracy on the ImageNet VID video object detection dataset and the DAVIS video object segmentation dataset. We further demonstrate that we can reinvest the saved computation into other parts of the network, and thus resulting in an accuracy increase at a comparable computational cost as the original system and beating other recently proposed state-of-the-art methods in the low latency range."}

They provide an efficient and effective way to utilize visual information selectively, which has shown to be especially valuable in multi-modal learning tasks. However, all prior attention frameworks lack the ability to explicitly model structural dependencies among attention variables, making it difficult to predict consistent attention masks. In this paper we develop a novel structured spatial attention mechanism which is end-to-end trainable and can be integrated with any feed-forward convolutional neural network. This proposed AttentionRNN layer explicitly enforces structure over the spatial attention variables by sequentially predicting attention values in the spatial mask in a bi-directional raster-scan and inverse raster-scan order. As a result, each attention value depends not only on local image or contextual information, but also on the previously predicted attention values. Our experiments show consistent quantitative and qualitative improvements on a variety of recognition tasks and datasets; including image categorization, question answering and image generation."}

Similarly, the output feature maps of a convolution layer can also be seen as a mixture of information at different frequencies. In this work, we propose to factorize the mixed feature maps by their frequencies, and design a novel Octave Convolution (OctConv) operation to store and process feature maps that vary spatially \"slower\" at a lower spatial resolution reducing both memory and computation cost. Unlike existing multi-scale methods, OctConv is formulated as a single, generic, plug-and-play convolutional unit that can be used as a direct replacement of (vanilla) convolutions without any adjustments in the network architecture. It is also orthogonal and complementary to methods that suggest better topologies or reduce channel-wise redundancy like group or depth-wise convolutions. We experimentally show that by simply replacing convolutions with OctConv, we can consistently boost accuracy for both image and video recognition tasks, while reducing memory and computational cost. An OctConv-equipped ResNet-152 can achieve 82.9% top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet with merely 22.2 GFLOPs."}

In this work, we present an intelligent and user-friendly 3D editing tool, where the edited model is constrained to lie onto a learned manifold of realistic shapes. Due to the topological variability of real 3D models, they often lie close to a disconnected manifold, which cannot be learned with a common learning algorithm. Therefore, our tool is based on a new deep learning model, DiscoNet, which extends 3D surface autoencoders in two ways. Firstly, our deep learning model uses several autoencoders to automatically learn each connected component of a disconnected manifold, without any supervision. Secondly, each autoencoder infers the output 3D surface by deforming a pre-learned 3D template specific to each connected component. Both advances translate into improved 3D synthesis, thus enhancing the quality of our 3D editing tool."}

This problem involves finding a rigid transformation from one point cloud into another so that they align. Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and its variants provide simple and easily-implemented iterative methods for this task, but these algorithms can converge to spurious local optima. To address local optima and other difficulties in the ICP pipeline, we propose a learning-based method, titled Deep Closest Point (DCP), inspired by recent techniques in computer vision and natural language processing. Our model consists of three parts: a point cloud embedding network, an attention-based module combined with a pointer generation layer to approximate combinatorial matching, and a differentiable singular value decomposition (SVD) layer to extract the final rigid transformation. We train our model end-to-end on the ModelNet40 dataset and show in several settings that it performs better than ICP, its variants (e.g., Go-ICP, FGR), and the recently-proposed learning-based method PointNetLK. Beyond providing a state-of-the-art registration technique, we evaluate the suitability of our learned features transferred to unseen objects.

We suggest that memory traffic for accessing intermediate feature maps can be a factor dominating the inference latency, especially in such tasks as real-time object detection and semantic segmentation of high-resolution video. We propose a Harmonic Densely Connected Network to achieve high efficiency in terms of both low MACs and memory traffic. The new network achieves 35%, 36%, 30%, 32%, and 45% inference time reduction compared with FC-DenseNet-103, DenseNet-264, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, and SSD-VGG, respectively. We use tools including Nvidia profiler and ARM Scale-Sim to measure the memory traffic and verify that the inference latency is indeed proportional to the memory traffic consumption and the proposed network consumes low memory traffic. We conclude that one should take memory traffic into consideration when designing neural network architectures for high-resolution applications at the edge."}

Existing algorithms usually formulate it as a semantic-visual correspondence problem, by learning mappings from one feature space to the other. Despite being reasonable, previous approaches essentially discard the highly precious discriminative power of visual features in an implicit way, and thus produce undesirable results. We instead reformulate ZSL as a conditioned visual classification problem, i.e., classifying visual features based on the classifiers learned from the semantic descriptions. With this reformulation, we develop algorithms targeting various ZSL settings: For the conventional setting, we propose to train a deep neural network that directly generates visual feature classifiers from the semantic attributes with an episode-based training scheme; For the generalized setting, we concatenate the learned highly discriminative classifiers for seen classes and the generated classifiers for unseen classes to classify visual features of all classes; For the transductive setting, we exploit unlabeled data to effectively calibrate the classifier generator using a novel learning-without-forgetting self-training mechanism and guide the process by a robust generalized cross-entropy loss. Extensive experiments show that our proposed algorithms significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods by large margins on most benchmark datasets in all the ZSL settings."}

However, when training with small minibatches, models using BN exhibit a significant degradation in performance. In this paper we study this peculiar behavior of BN to gain a better understanding of the problem, and identify a cause. We propose `EvalNorm' to address the issue by estimating corrected normalization statistics to use for BN during evaluation. EvalNorm supports online estimation of the corrected statistics while the model is being trained, and does not affect the training scheme of the model. As a result, EvalNorm can also be used with existing pre-trained models allowing them to benefit from our method. EvalNorm yields large gains for models trained with smaller batches.

In order to extend the applications' boundaries to some accuracy-crucial domains, researchers have been investigating approaches to boost accuracy through either deeper or wider network structures, which brings with them the exponential increment of the computational and storage cost, delaying the responding time. In this paper, we propose a general training framework named self distillation, which notably enhances the performance (accuracy) of convolutional neural networks through shrinking the size of the network rather than aggrandizing it. Different from traditional knowledge distillation - a knowledge transformation methodology among networks, which forces student neural networks to approximate the softmax layer outputs of pre-trained teacher neural networks, the proposed self distillation framework distills knowledge within network itself. The networks are firstly divided into several sections. Then the knowledge in the deeper portion of the networks is squeezed into the shallow ones. Experiments further prove the generalization of the proposed self distillation framework: enhancement of accuracy at average level is 2.65%, varying from 0.61% in ResNeXt as minimum to 4.07% in VGG19 as maximum. In addition, it can also provide flexibility of depth-wise scalable inference on resource-limited edge devices. Our codes have been released on github."}

In this paper, we go a step further and show that by addressing the fundamental high-variance issue of few-shot learning classifiers, it is possible to significantly outperform current meta-learning techniques. Our approach consists of designing an ensemble of deep networks to leverage the variance of the classifiers, and introducing new strategies to encourage the networks to cooperate, while encouraging prediction diversity.

Because reID is different from classification, the architecture should be modified accordingly. We propose to automatically search for a CNN architecture that is specifically suitable for the reID task. There are three aspects to be tackled. First, body structural information plays an important role in reID but it is not encoded in backbones. Second, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the process of architecture design without human effort, but no existing NAS methods incorporate the structure information of input images. Third, reID is essentially a retrieval task but current NAS algorithms are merely designed for classification. To solve these problems, we propose a retrieval-based search algorithm over a specifically designed reID search space, named Auto-ReID. Our Auto-ReID enables the automated approach to find an efficient and effective CNN architecture for reID. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the searched architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing 50% parameters and 53% FLOPs compared to others."}

The method interleaves sampling and consolidation of the current data interpretation via repetitive hypothesis proposal, fast rejection, and integration of the new hypothesis into the kept instance set by labeling energy minimization. Due to exploring the data progressively, the method has several beneficial properties compared with the state-of-the-art. First, a clear criterion, adopted from RANSAC, controls the termination and stops the algorithm when the probability of finding a new model with a reasonable number of inliers falls below a threshold. Second, Prog-X is an any-time algorithm. Thus, whenever is interrupted, e.g. due to a time limit, the returned instances cover real and, likely, the most dominant ones. The method is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy in both synthetic experiments and on publicly available real-world datasets for homography, two-view motion, and motion segmentation."}

The features of interiors should be invariant to strong appearance change so as to pop-out the salient object as a whole, while the features of boundaries should be selective to slight appearance change to distinguish salient objects and background. To address this selectivity-invariance dilemma, we propose a novel boundary-aware network with successive dilation for image-based SOD. In this network, the feature selectivity at boundaries is enhanced by incorporating a boundary localization stream, while the feature invariance at interiors is guaranteed with a complex interior perception stream. Moreover, a transition compensation stream is adopted to amend the probable failures in transitional regions between interiors and boundaries. In particular, an integrated successive dilation module is proposed to enhance the feature invariance at interiors and transitional regions. Extensive experiments on six datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms 16 state-of-the-art methods."}

Current bottom-up proposal generation methods can generate proposals with precise boundary, but cannot efficiently generate adequately reliable confidence scores for retrieving proposals. To address these difficulties, we introduce the Boundary-Matching (BM) mechanism to evaluate confidence scores of densely distributed proposals, which denote a proposal as a matching pair of starting and ending boundaries and combine all densely distributed BM pairs into the BM confidence map. Based on BM mechanism, we propose an effective, efficient and end-to-end proposal generation method, named Boundary-Matching Network (BMN), which generates proposals with precise temporal boundaries as well as reliable confidence scores simultaneously. The two-branches of BMN are jointly trained in an unified framework. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-1.3, where BMN shows significant performance improvement with remarkable efficiency and generalizability. Further, combining with existing action classifier, BMN can achieve state-of-the-art temporal action detection performance."}

Relying on the Mask R-CNN backbone, we extract mask proposals per frame and formulate the matching between object templates and proposals as a linear assignment problem where thA heading inside a blocke cost matrix is predicted by a deep convolutional neural network. We propose a differentiable matching layer which unrolls a projected gradient descent algorithm in which the projection step exploits the Dykstra's algorithm. We prove that under mild conditions, the matching is guaranteed to converge to the optimal one. In practice, it achieves similar performance compared to the Hungarian algorithm during inference. Meanwhile, we can back-propagate through it to learn the cost matrix. After matching, a U-Net style architecture is exploited to refine the matched mask per time step. On DAVIS 2017 dataset, DMM-Net achieves the best performance without online learning on the first frames and the 2nd best with it. Without any fine-tuning, DMM-Net performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods on SegTrack v2 dataset. At last, our differentiable matching layer is very simple to implement; we attach the PyTorch code in the supplementary material which is less than 50 lines long."}

However, DNNs are found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted inputs aiming to mislead a learner to make incorrect predictions. While several defense and detection approaches are proposed for static image classification, many security-critical tasks use videos as their input and require efficient processing. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective method advIT to detect adversarial frames within videos against different types of attacks based on temporal consistency property of videos. In particular, we apply optical flow estimation to the target and previous frames to generate pseudo frames and evaluate the consistency of the learner output between these pseudo frames and target. High inconsistency indicates that the target frame is adversarial. We conduct extensive experiments on various learning tasks including video semantic segmentation, human pose estimation, object detection, and action recognition, and demonstrate that we can achieve above 95% adversarial frame detection rate. To consider adaptive attackers, we show that even if an adversary has access to the detector and performs a strong adaptive attack based on the state of the art expectation of transformation method, the detection rate stays almost the same. We also tested the transferability among different optical flow estimators and show that it is hard for attackers to attack one and transfer the perturbation to others. In addition, as efficiency is important in video analysis, we show that advIT can achieve real-time detection in about 0.03--0.4 seconds."}

Matching based and propagation based methods run at a faster speed by avoiding OL techniques. However, they are limited by sub-optimal accuracy, due to mismatching and drifting problems. In this paper, we develop a real-time yet very accurate Ranking Attention Network (RANet) for VOS. Specifically, to integrate the insights of matching based and propagation based methods, we employ an encoder-decoder framework to learn pixel-level similarity and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. To better utilize the similarity maps, we propose a novel ranking attention module, which automatically ranks and selects these maps for fine-grained VOS performance. Experiments on DAVIS16 and DAVIS17 datasets show that our RANet achieves the best speed-accuracy trade-off, e.g., with 33 milliseconds per frame and J&F=85.5% on DAVIS16. With OL, our RANet reaches J&F=87.1% on DAVIS16, exceeding state-of-the-art VOS methods. The code can be found at https://github.com/Storife/RANet."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2019", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Bridging the Gap Between Detection and Tracking", "Title": "A Unified Approach", "Abstract": "Object detection models have been a source of inspiration for many tracking-by-detection algorithms over the past decade. Recent deep trackers borrow designs or modules from the latest object detection methods, such as bounding box regression, RPN and ROI pooling, and can deliver impressive performance. In this paper, instead of redesigning a new tracking-by-detection algorithm, we aim to explore a general framework for building trackers directly upon almost any advanced object detector. To achieve this, three key gaps must be bridged: (1) Object detectors are class-specific, while trackers are class-agnostic. (2) Object detectors do not differentiate intra-class instances, while this is a critical capability of a tracker. (3) Temporal cues are important for stable long-term tracking while they are not considered in still-image detectors. To address the above issues, we first present a simple target-guidance module for guiding the detector to locate target-relevant objects. Then a meta-learner is adopted for the detector to fast learn and adapt a target-distractor classifier online. We further introduce an anchored updating strategy to alleviate the problem of overfitting. The framework is instantiated on SSD and FasterRCNN, the typical one- and two-stage detectors, respectively. Experiments on OTB, UAV123 and NfS have verified our framework and show that our trackers can benefit from deeper backbone networks, as opposed to many recent trackers."}

This task is usually termed snapshot compressive-spectral imaging (SCI), which enjoys low cost, low bandwidth and high-speed sensing rate via capturing the three-dimensional (3D) signal i.e., (x, y, l), using a 2D snapshot. Though proposed more than a decade ago, the poor quality and low-speed of reconstruction algorithms preclude wide applications of SCI. To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop a dual-stage generative model to reconstruct the desired 3D signal in SCI, dubbed l-net. Results on both simulation and real datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of l-net, which leads to >4dB improvement in PSNR for real-mask-in-the-loop simulation data compared to the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, l-net can finish the reconstruction task within sub-seconds instead of hours taken by the most recently proposed DeSCI algorithm, thus speeding up the reconstruction >1000 times."}

However, the perceptual quality of the restored image is relatively subjective, and it is necessary for users to control the reconstruction result according to personal preferences or image characteristics, which cannot be done using existing deterministic networks. This motivates us to exquisitely design a unified interactive framework for general image restoration tasks. Under this framework, users can control continuous transition of different objectives, e.g., the perception-distortion trade-off of image super-resolution, the trade-off between noise reduction and detail preservation. We achieve this goal by controlling the latent features of the designed network. To be specific, our proposed framework, named Controllable Feature Space Network (CFSNet), is entangled by two branches based on different objectives. Our framework can adaptively learn the coupling coefficients of different layers and channels, which provides finer control of the restored image quality. Experiments on several typical image restoration tasks fully validate the effective benefits of the proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/qibao77/CFSNet."}

The top performers in this field include deep or wide convolutional neural networks, or recurrent neural networks. However, the methods enforce a single model to process all kinds of textures and structures. A typical operation is that a certain layer restores the textures based on the ones recovered by the preceding layers, ignoring the characteristics of image textures. In this paper, we believe that the lower-frequency and higher-frequency information in images have different levels of complexity and should be restored by models of different representational capacity. Inspired by this, we propose a novel embedded block residual network (EBRN) which is an incremental recovering progress for texture super-resolution. Specifically, different modules in the model restores information of different frequencies. For lower-frequency information, we use shallower modules of the network to recover; for higher-frequency information, we use deeper modules to restore. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed EBRN model achieves superior performance and visual improvements against the state-of-the-arts."}

Much prior work uses either a supervised mode of learning or stereo images. The former is limited by the amount of labeled data, as it requires expensive sensors, while the latter is not always readily available as monocular sequences. In this work, we demonstrate the benefit of using geometric information from synthetic images, coupled with scene depth information, to recover the scale in depth and ego-motion estimation from monocular videos. We developed our framework using synthetic image-depth pairs and unlabeled real monocular images. We had three training objectives: first, to use deep feature alignment to reduce the domain gap between synthetic and monocular images to yield more accurate depth estimation when presented with only real monocular images at test time. Second, we learn scene specific representation by exploiting self-supervision coming from multi-view synthetic images without the need for depth labels. Third, our method uses single-view depth and pose networks, which are capable of jointly training and supervising one another mutually, yielding consistent depth and ego-motion estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our depth and ego-motion models surpass the state-of-the-art, unsupervised methods and compare favorably to early supervised deep models for geometric understanding. We validate the effectiveness of our training objectives against standard benchmarks thorough an ablation study."}

We capture intra-modal dependencies using a separate graph neural network for each modality (visual and lingual), and then use conditional message-passing in another graph neural network to fuse their outputs and capture cross-modal relationships. This final representation results in grounding decisions. The framework supports many-to-many matching and is able to ground single phrase to multiple image regions and vice versa.

Unlike previous learning based methods, we explicitly constraint the smoothness of depth maps by using conditional random fields (CRFs) after the stage of cost volume regularization. The CRFs module is implemented as recurrent neural networks so that the whole pipeline can be trained end-to-end. Our results show that the proposed pipeline outperforms previous state-of-the-arts on large-scale DTU dataset.

NG-RANSAC uses prior information to improve model hypothesis search, increasing the chance of finding outlier-free minimal sets. Previous works use heuristic side-information like hand-crafted descriptor distance to guide hypothesis search. In contrast, we learn hypothesis search in a principled fashion that lets us optimize an arbitrary task loss during training, leading to large improvements on classic computer vision tasks. We present two further extensions to NG-RANSAC. Firstly, using the inlier count itself as training signal allows us to train neural guidance in a self-supervised fashion. Secondly, we combine neural guidance with differentiable RANSAC to build neural networks which focus on certain parts of the input data and make the output predictions as good as possible. We evaluate NG-RANSAC on a wide array of computer vision tasks, namely estimation of epipolar geometry, horizon line estimation and camera re-localization. We achieve superior or competitive results compared to state-of-the-art robust estimators, including very recent, learned ones."}

Towards this goal, we developed a differentiable PatchMatch module that allows us to discard most disparities without requiring full cost volume evaluation. We then exploit this representation to learn which range to prune for each pixel. By progressively reducing the search space and effectively propagating such information, we are able to efficiently compute the cost volume for high likelihood hypotheses and achieve savings in both memory and computation.Finally, an image guided refinement module is exploited to further improve the performance. Since all our components are differentiable, the full network can be trained end-to-end. Our experiments show that our method achieves competitive results on KITTI and SceneFlow datasets while running in real-time at 62ms."}

Disentangling the generation of shape and appearance to ensure photorealistic results, our framework consists of a shape generation network and an appearance generation network. More importantly, for each generation network, we introduce two encoders interacting with one another to learn latent codes in a shared compatibility space. The latent representations are jointly optimized with the corresponding generation network to condition the synthesis process, encouraging a diverse set of generated results that are visually compatible with existing fashion garments. In addition, our framework is readily extended to clothing reconstruction and fashion transfer.

However, each natural image has its own internal statistics, captured by its unique distribution of patches. In this paper we propose an \"Internal GAN\" (InGAN) -- an image-specific GAN -- which trains on a single input image and learns its internal distribution of patches. It is then able to synthesize a plethora of new natural images of significantly different sizes, shapes and aspect-ratios - all with the same internal patch-distribution (same \"DNA\") as the input image. In particular, despite large changes in global size/shape of the image, all elements inside the image maintain their local size/shape. InGAN is fully unsupervised, requiring no additional data other than the input image itself. Once trained on the input image, it can remap the input to any size or shape in a single feedforward pass, while preserving the same internal patch distribution. InGAN provides a unified framework for a variety of tasks, bridging the gap between textures and natural images."}

Inspired by such behavior and the fact that machines also have computational constraints, we propose COnditional COordinate GAN (COCO-GAN) of which the generator generates images by parts based on their spatial coordinates as the condition. On the other hand, the discriminator learns to justify realism across multiple assembled patches by global coherence, local appearance, and edge-crossing continuity. Despite the full images are never manipulated during training, we show that COCO-GAN can produce state-of-the-art-quality full images during inference. We further demonstrate a variety of novel applications enabled by our coordinate-aware framework. First, we perform extrapolation to the learned coordinate manifold and generate off-the-boundary patches. Combining with the originally generated full image, COCO-GAN can produce images that are larger than training samples, which we called \"beyond-boundary generation\". We then showcase panorama generation within a cylindrical coordinate system that inherently preserves horizontally cyclic topology. On the computation side, COCO-GAN has a built-in divide-and-conquer paradigm that reduces memory requisition during training and inference, provides high-parallelism, and can generate parts of images on-demand."}

At the same time, generative models were proposed that can generate highly realistic images. However, despite this success in these closely related tasks, texture reconstruction of 3D objects has received little attention from the research community and state-of-the-art methods are either limited to comparably low resolution or constrained experimental setups. A major reason for these limitations is that common representations of texture are inefficient or hard to interface for modern deep learning techniques. In this paper, we propose Texture Fields, a novel texture representation which is based on regressing a continuous 3D function parameterized with a neural network. Our approach circumvents limiting factors like shape discretization and parameterization, as the proposed texture representation is independent of the shape representation of the 3D object. We show that Texture Fields are able to represent high frequency texture and naturally blend with modern deep learning techniques. Experimentally, we find that Texture Fields compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods for conditional texture reconstruction of 3D objects and enable learning of probabilistic generative models for texturing unseen 3D models. We believe that Texture Fields will become an important building block for the next generation of generative 3D models."}

Despite the recent success of deep learning models in discriminative tasks of point clouds, generating point clouds remains challenging. This paper proposes a principled probabilistic framework to generate 3D point clouds by modeling them as a distribution of distributions. Specifically, we learn a two-level hierarchy of distributions where the first level is the distribution of shapes and the second level is the distribution of points given a shape. This formulation allows us to both sample shapes and sample an arbitrary number of points from a shape. Our generative model, named PointFlow, learns each level of the distribution with a continuous normalizing flow. The invertibility of normalizing flows enables the computation of the likelihood during training and allows us to train our model in the variational inference framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that PointFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud generation. We additionally show that our model can faithfully reconstruct point clouds and learn useful representations in an unsupervised manner.

SinGAN contains a pyramid of fully convolutional GANs, each responsible for learning the patch distribution at a different scale of the image. This allows generating new samples of arbitrary size and aspect ratio, that have significant variability, yet maintain both the global structure and the fine textures of the training image. In contrast to previous single image GAN schemes, our approach is not limited to texture images, and is not conditional (i.e. it generates samples from noise). User studies confirm that the generated samples are commonly confused to be real images. We illustrate the utility of SinGAN in a wide range of image manipulation tasks."}

Extensive experiments on the \\vatex dataset show that, first, the unified multilingual model can not only produce both English and Chinese descriptions for a video more efficiently, but also offer improved performance over the monolingual models.

Compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), it only requires two additional forward-mode automatic differentiation operations per iteration, which has a computational cost comparable to two standard forward passes and is easy to implement. Our method addresses long-standing issues with current second-order solvers, which invert an approximate Hessian matrix every iteration exactly or by conjugate-gradient methods, procedures that are much slower than a SGD step. Instead, we propose to keep a single estimate of the gradient projected by the inverse Hessian matrix, and update it once per iteration with just two passes over the network. This estimate has the same size and is similar to the momentum variable that is commonly used in  SGD . No estimate of the Hessian is maintained. We first validate our method, called CurveBall, on small problems with known solutions (noisy Rosenbrock function and degenerate 2-layer linear networks), where current deep learning solvers struggle. We then train several large models on CIFAR and ImageNet, including ResNet and VGG-f networks, where we demonstrate faster convergence with no hyperparameter tuning. We also show our optimiser's generality by testing on a large set of randomly generated architectures."}

However, the majority of adversarial attacks assume global, fine-grained control over the image pixel space. In this paper, we consider a different setting: what happens if the adversary could only alter specific attributes of the input image? These would generate inputs that might be perceptibly different, but still natural-looking and enough to fool a classifier. We propose a novel approach to generate such \"semantic\" adversarial examples by optimizing a particular adversarial loss over the range-space of a parametric conditional generative model. We demonstrate implementations of our attacks on binary classifiers trained on face images, and show that such natural-looking semantic adversarial examples exist. We evaluate the effectiveness of our attack on synthetic and real data, and present detailed comparisons with existing attack methods. We supplement our empirical results with theoretical bounds that demonstrate the existence of such parametric adversarial examples."}

They have proposed various hard negative sample mining strategies, but very few addressed this problem from the perspective of loss functions. Our research shows that the conventional Siamese and triplet losses treat all samples linearly, thus make the training time consuming. Instead, we propose the exponential Siamese and triplet losses, which can naturally focus more on hard samples and put less emphasis on easy ones, meanwhile, speed up the optimization. To assist the exponential losses, we introduce the hard positive sample mining to further enhance the effectiveness. The extensive experiments demonstrate our proposal improves both metric and descriptor learning on several well accepted benchmarks, and outperforms the state-of-the-arts on the UBC dataset. Moreover, it also shows a better generalizability on cross-spectral image matching and image retrieval tasks."}

However, due to the discreteness of low-bit quantization, existing quantization methods often face the unstable training process and severe performance degradation. To address this problem, in this paper we propose Differentiable Soft Quantization (DSQ) to bridge the gap between the full-precision and low-bit networks. DSQ can automatically evolve during training to gradually approximate the standard quantization. Owing to its differentiable property, DSQ can help pursue the accurate gradients in backward propagation, and reduce the quantization loss in forward process with an appropriate clipping range. Extensive experiments over several popular network structures show that training low-bit neural networks with DSQ can consistently outperform state-of-the-art quantization methods. Besides, our first efficient implementation for deploying 2 to 4-bit DSQ on devices with ARM architecture achieves up to 1.7x speed up, compared with the open-source 8-bit high-performance inference framework NCNN [31]."}

Adversarial attacks formally correspond to an optimization problem: find a minimum norm image perturbation, constrained to cause misclassification. A number of effective attacks have been developed. However, to date, no gradient-based attacks have used best practices from the optimization literature to solve this constrained minimization problem. We design a new untargeted attack, based on these best practices, using the well-regarded logarithmic barrier method. On average, our attack distance is similar or better than all state-of-the-art attacks on benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet-1K). In addition, our method performs significantly better on the most challenging images, those which normally require larger perturbations for misclassification. We employ the LogBarrier attack on several adversarially defended models, and show that it adversarially perturbs all images more efficiently than other attacks: the distance needed to perturb all images is significantly smaller with the LogBarrier attack than with other state-of-the-art attacks."}

While many current methods offer tools to perform this analysis for a given (trained) network post-hoc, recent results (especially on capsule networks) suggest that when classes map to a few high level \"concepts\" in the preceding layers of the network, the behavior of the network is easier to interpret or explain. Such training may be accomplished via dynamic/EM routing where the network \"routes\" for individual classes (or subsets of images) are dynamic and involve few nodes even if the full network may not be sparse. In this paper, we show how a simple modification of the SGD scheme can help provide dynamic/EM routing type behavior in convolutional neural networks. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate the effect of this idea for interpretability where we obtain promising results, while also showing that no compromise in attainable accuracy is involved. Further, we show that the minor modification is seemingly ad-hoc, the new algorithm can be analyzed by an approximate method which provably matches known rates for SGD."}

Here, an attacker cannot access confidence scores, but only the final label. Most attacks for this scenario are either unreliable or inefficient. Focusing on the latter, we show that a specific class of attacks, Boundary Attacks, can be reinterpreted as a biased sampling framework that gains efficiency from domain knowledge. We identify three such biases, image frequency, regional masks and surrogate gradients, and evaluate their performance against an ImageNet classifier. We show that the combination of these biases outperforms the state of the art by a wide margin. We also showcase an efficient way to attack the Google Cloud Vision API, where we craft convincing perturbations with just a few hundred queries. Finally, the methods we propose have also been found to work very well against strong defenses: Our targeted attack won second place in the NeurIPS 2018 Adversarial Vision Challenge."}

We introduce the concept of targeted mismatch attack for deep learning based retrieval systems to generate an adversarial image to conceal the query image. The generated image looks nothing like the user intended query, but leads to identical or very similar retrieval results. Transferring attacks to fully unseen networks is challenging. We show successful attacks to partially unknown systems, by designing various loss functions for the adversarial image construction.

This question presents an intriguing new computer vision challenge. We introduce Fashion++, an approach that proposes minimal adjustments to a full-body clothing outfit that will have maximal impact on its fashionability. Our model consists of a deep image generation neural network that learns to synthesize clothing conditioned on learned per-garment encodings. The latent encodings are explicitly factorized according to shape and texture, thereby allowing direct edits for both fit/presentation and color/patterns/material, respectively. We show how to bootstrap Web photos to automatically train a fashionability model, and develop an activation maximization-style approach to transform the input image into its more fashionable self. The edits suggested range from swapping in a new garment to tweaking its color, how it is worn (e.g., rolling up sleeves), or its fit (e.g., making pants baggier). Experiments demonstrate that Fashion++ provides successful edits, both according to automated metrics and human opinion."}

In this work, we propose a new task along this research direction, we call few-shot common-localization. Given a few weakly-supervised support images, we aim to localize the common object in the query image without any box annotation. This task differs from standard few-shot settings, since we aim to address the localization problem, rather than the global classification problem. To tackle this new problem, we propose a network that aims to get the most out of the support and query images. To that end, we introduce a spatial similarity module that searches the spatial commonality among the given images. We furthermore introduce a feature reweighting module to balance the influence of different support images through graph convolutional networks. To evaluate few-shot common-localization, we repurpose and reorganize the well-known Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets, as well as a video dataset from ImageNet VID. Experiments on the new settings for few-shot common-localization shows the importance of searching for spatial similarity and feature reweighting, outperforming baselines from related tasks."}

Recent deep models for image retrieval have outperformed traditional methods by leveraging ranking-tailored loss functions, but important theoretical and practical problems remain. First, rather than directly optimizing the global ranking, they minimize an upper-bound on the essential loss, which does not necessarily result in an optimal mean average precision (mAP). Second, these methods require significant engineering efforts to work well, e.g., special pre-training and hard-negative mining. In this paper we propose instead to directly optimize the global mAP by leveraging recent advances in listwise loss formulations. Using a histogram binning approximation, the AP can be differentiated and thus employed to end-to-end learning. Compared to existing losses, the proposed method considers thousands of images simultaneously at each iteration and eliminates the need for ad hoc tricks. It also establishes a new state of the art on many standard retrieval benchmarks. Models and evaluation scripts have been made available at: https://europe.naverlabs.com/Deep-Image-Retrieval/."}

When labelled training data is available, network weights and activations have successfully been quantized down to 1-bit. The same cannot be said about the scenario when labelled training data is not available, e.g. when quantizing a pre-trained model, where current approaches show, at best, no loss of accuracy at 8-bit quantizations. We introduce DSConv, a flexible quantized convolution operator that replaces single-precision operations with their far less expensive integer counterparts, while maintaining the probability distributions over both the kernel weights and the outputs. We test our model as a plug-and-play replacement for standard convolution on most popular neural network architectures, ResNet, DenseNet, GoogLeNet, AlexNet and VGG-Net and demonstrate state-of-the-art results, with less than 1% loss of accuracy, without retraining, using only 4-bit quantization.

It also supports back propagation and is trainable end-to end. By adding this operator, we introduce a new way to combine top-down and bottom-up information in semantic segmentation. Our experiments show the effectiveness of IMP on both clothing parsing (with complex layering, large deformations, and non-convex objects), and on street scene segmentation (with many overlapping instances and small objects). On the Varied Clothing Parsing dataset (VCP), we show instance mask projection can improve mIOU by 3 points over a state-of-the-art Panoptic FPN segmentation approach. On the ModaNet clothing parsing dataset, we show a dramatic improvement of 20.4% compared to existing baseline semantic segmentation results. In addition, the Instance Mask Projection operator works well on other (non-clothing) datasets, providing an improvement in mIOU of 3 points on \"thing\" classes of Cityscapes, a self-driving dataset, over a state-of-the-art approach."}

The multi-scale context module refers to the operations to aggregate feature responses from a large spatial extent, while the single-stage encoder-decoder structure encodes the high-level semantic information in the encoder path and recovers the boundary information in the decoder path. In contrast, multi-stage encoder-decoder networks have been widely used in human pose estimation and show superior performance than their single-stage counterpart. However, few efforts have been attempted to bring this effective design to semantic segmentation. In this work, we propose a Semantic Prediction Guidance (SPG) module which learns to re-weight the local features through the guidance from pixel-wise semantic prediction. We find that by carefully re-weighting features across stages, a two-stage encoder-decoder network coupled with our proposed SPG module can significantly outperform its one-stage counterpart with similar parameters and computations. Finally, we report experimental results on the semantic segmentation benchmark Cityscapes, in which our SPGNet attains 81.1% on the test set using only 'fine' annotations."}

This however may not be ideal as they contain very different type of information relevant for recognition. Here, we propose a new two-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires shape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that processes information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this architecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the two streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical stream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively removing noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the relevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow architecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution. Our experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that produces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts performance on thinner and smaller objects. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cityscapes benchmark, in terms of both mask (mIoU) and boundary (F-score) quality, improving by 2% and 4% over strong baselines."}

A thorough grasp of the elusive shape requires sufficiently contextual semantic information, yet few works devote to this. Here we propose DensePoint, a general architecture to learn densely contextual representation for point cloud processing. Technically, it extends regular grid CNN to irregular point configuration by generalizing a convolution operator, which holds the permutation invariance of points, and achieves efficient inductive learning of local patterns. Architecturally, it finds inspiration from dense connection mode, to repeatedly aggregate multi-level and multi-scale semantics in a deep hierarchy. As a result, densely contextual information along with rich semantics, can be acquired by DensePoint in an organic manner, making it highly effective. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across four tasks, as well as thorough model analysis, verify DensePoint achieves the state of the arts."}

Our method is evaluated on PASCAL-5^i dataset and outperforms the state-of-the-art in the few-shot semantic segmentation. Unlike previous methods, our approach does not require a second branch to estimate parameters or prototypes, which enables it to be used with 2-stream motion and appearance based segmentation networks. We further propose a novel setup for evaluating continual learning of object segmentation which we name incremental PASCAL (iPASCAL) where our method outperforms the baseline method.

However, all existing NDVR datasets are introduced for long videos. Furthermore, most of them are small-scale and lack of diversity due to the high cost of collecting and labeling near-duplicate videos. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale short video dataset, called SVD, for the NDVR task. SVD contains over 500,000 short videos and over 30,000 labeled videos of near-duplicates. We use multiple video mining techniques to construct positive/negative pairs. Furthermore, we design temporal and spatial transformations to mimic user-attack behavior in real applications for constructing more difficult variants of SVD. Experiments show that existing state-of-the-art NDVR methods, including real-value based and hashing based methods, fail to achieve satisfactory performance on this challenging dataset. The release of SVD dataset will foster research and system engineering in the NDVR area. The SVD dataset is available at https://svdbase.github.io."}

However, full-image annotations are expensive, with experts spending up to 90 minutes per image. We propose block sub-image annotation as a replacement for full-image annotation. Despite the attention cost of frequent task switching, we find that block annotations can be crowdsourced at higher quality compared to full-image annotation with equal monetary cost using existing annotation tools developed for full-image annotation. Surprisingly, we find that 50% pixels annotated with blocks allows semantic segmentation to achieve equivalent performance to 100% pixels annotated. Furthermore, as little as 12% of pixels annotated allows performance as high as 98% of the performance with dense annotation. In weakly-supervised settings, block annotation outperforms existing methods by 3-4% (absolute) given equivalent annotation time. To recover the necessary global structure for applications such as characterizing spatial context and affordance relationships, we propose an effective method to inpaint block-annotated images with high-quality labels without additional human effort. As such, fewer annotations can also be used for these applications compared to full-image annotation."}

We show that trained models significantly amplify the association of target labels with gender beyond what one would expect from biased datasets. Surprisingly, we show that even when datasets are balanced such that each label co-occurs equally with each gender, learned models amplify the association between labels and gender, as much as if data had not been balanced! To mitigate this, we adopt an adversarial approach to remove unwanted features corresponding to protected variables from intermediate representations in a deep neural network - and provide a detailed analysis of its effectiveness. Experiments on two datasets: the COCO dataset (objects), and the imSitu dataset (actions), show reductions in gender bias amplification while maintaining most of the accuracy of the original models."}

Our approach is easy to implement and fast to execute, making it easily deployable. FAX uses an image-translation network which recovers geometry at the original resolution of the image. Counterintuitively, the main loss which drives FAX is on per-pixel surface normals instead of per-pixel depth, making it possible to estimate detailed body geometry without any depth supervision. We evaluate our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively, and compare with a state-of-the-art method."}

In particular, we focus on the problem of capturing 3D information about Grevy's zebras from a collection of images. The Grevy's zebra is one of the most endangered species in Africa, with only a few thousand individuals left. Capturing the shape and pose of these animals can provide biologists and conservationists with information about animal health and behavior. In contrast to research on human pose, shape and texture estimation, training data for endangered species is limited, the animals are in complex natural scenes with occlusion, they are naturally camouflaged, travel in herds, and look similar to each other. To overcome these challenges, we integrate the recent SMAL animal model into a network-based regression pipeline, which we train end-to-end on synthetically generated images with pose, shape, and background variation. Going beyond state-of-the-art methods for human shape and pose estimation, our method learns a shape space for zebras during training. Learning such a shape space from images using only a photometric loss is novel, and the approach can be used to learn shape in other settings with limited 3D supervision. Moreover, we couple 3D pose and shape prediction with the task of texture synthesis, obtaining a full texture map of the animal from a single image. We show that the predicted texture map allows a novel per-instance unsupervised optimization over the network features. This method, SMALST (SMAL with learned Shape and Texture) goes beyond previous work, which assumed manual keypoints and/or segmentation, to regress directly from pixels to 3D animal shape, pose and texture."}

However, while state-of-the-art methods are able to output complex 3D geometry, it is not clear how to extend these results to time-varying topologies. Approaches treating each time step individually lack continuity and exhibit slow inference, while traditional 4D reconstruction methods often utilize a template model or discretize the 4D space at fixed resolution. In this work, we present Occupancy Flow, a novel spatio-temporal representation of time-varying 3D geometry with implicit correspondences. Towards this goal, we learn a temporally and spatially continuous vector field which assigns a motion vector to every point in space and time. In order to perform dense 4D reconstruction from images or sparse point clouds, we combine our method with a continuous 3D representation. Implicitly, our model yields correspondences over time, thus enabling fast inference while providing a sound physical description of the temporal dynamics. We show that our method can be used for interpolation and reconstruction tasks, and demonstrate the accuracy of the learned correspondences. We believe that Occupancy Flow is a promising new 4D representation which will be useful for a variety of spatio-temporal reconstruction tasks."}

In contrast, existing human motion capture (mocap) datasets are small and the motions limited, hampering progress on learning models of human motion. While there are many different datasets available, they each use a different parameterization of the body, making it difficult to integrate them into a single meta dataset. To address this, we introduce AMASS, a large and varied database of human motion that unifies 15 different optical marker-based mocap datasets by representing them within a common framework and parameterization. We achieve this using a new method, MoSh++, that converts mocap data into realistic 3D human meshes represented by a rigged body model. Here we use SMPL [Loper et al., 2015], which is widely used and provides a standard skeletal representation as well as a fully rigged surface mesh. The method works for arbitrary marker sets, while recovering soft-tissue dynamics and realistic hand motion. We evaluate MoSh++ and tune its hyperparameters using a new dataset of 4D body scans that are jointly recorded with markerbased mocap. The consistent representation of AMASS makes it readily useful for animation, visualization, and generating training data for deep learning. Our dataset is significantly richer than previous human motion collections, having more than 40 hours of motion data, spanning over 300 subjects, more than 11000 motions, and will be publicly available to the research community."}

These solutions require 2D images, depth maps or 3D point clouds of person bodies as input. In this paper, we take one step forward to show that fine-grained person perception is possible even with 1D sensors: WiFi antennas. Specifically, we used two sets of WiFi antennas to acquire signals, i.e., one transmitter set and one receiver set. Each set contains three antennas horizontally lined-up as a regular household WiFi router. The WiFi signal generated by a transmitter antenna, penetrates through and reflects on human bodies, furniture, and walls, and then superposes at a receiver antenna as 1D signal samples. We developed a deep learning approach that uses annotations on 2D images, takes the received 1D WiFi signals as input, and performs body segmentation and pose estimation in an end-to-end manner. To our knowledge, our solution is the first work based on off-the-shelf WiFi antennas and standard IEEE 802.11n WiFi signals. Demonstrating comparable results to image-based solutions, our WiFi-based person perception solution is cheaper and more ubiquitous than radars and LiDARs, while invariant to illumination and has little privacy concern comparing to cameras."}

However, these algorithms are neither accurate nor stable in motion-blurred videos. The missing of structure information makes it difficult for state-of-the-art facial landmark detection algorithms to yield good results. In this paper, we propose a framework named FAB that takes advantage of structure consistency in the temporal dimension for facial landmark detection in motion-blurred videos. A structure predictor is proposed to predict the missing face structural information temporally, which serves as a geometry prior. This allows our framework to work as a virtuous circle. On one hand, the geometry prior helps our structure-aware deblurring network generates high quality deblurred images which lead to better landmark detection results. On the other hand, better landmark detection results help structure predictor generate better geometry prior for the next frame. Moreover, it is a flexible video-based framework that can incorporate any static image-based methods to provide a performance boost on video datasets.

Previous methods aim to localize action starts by learning feature representations that can directly separate the start point from its preceding background. It is challenging due to the subtle appearance difference near the action starts and the lack of training data. Instead, StartNet decomposes ODAS into two stages: action classification (using ClsNet) and start point localization (using LocNet). ClsNet focuses on per-frame labeling and predicts action score distributions online. Based on the predicted action scores of the past and current frames, LocNet conducts class-agnostic start detection by optimizing long-term localization rewards using policy gradient methods. The proposed framework is validated on two large-scale datasets, THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet. The experimental results show that StartNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by 15%-30% p-mAP under the offset tolerance of 1-10 seconds on THUMOS'14, and achieves comparable performance on ActivityNet with 10 times smaller time offset."}

In contrast to current state-of-the-art methods which first learn a model to predict future video features and then perform action anticipation using these features, the proposed framework jointly learns to perform the two tasks, future visual and temporal representation synthesis, and early action anticipation. The joint learning framework ensures that the predicted future embeddings are informative to the action anticipation task. Furthermore, through extensive experimental evaluations we demonstrate the utility of using both visual and temporal semantics of the scene, and illustrate how this representation synthesis could be achieved through a recurrent Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework.

Despite this, the most widely adopted perceptual metrics today, such as SSIM and FSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to consider many factors of human perception. Recently, the facial modeling community has observed that the inclusion of both structure and texture has a significant positive benefit for face sketch synthesis (FSS). But how perceptual are these so-called \"perceptual features\"? Which elements are critical for their success? In this paper, we design a perceptual metric, called Structure Co-Occurrence Texture (Scoot), which simultaneously considers the block-level spatial structure and co-occurrence texture statistics. To test the quality of metrics, we propose three novel meta-measures based on various reliable properties. Extensive experiments verify that our Scoot metric exceeds the performance of prior work. Besides, we built the first largest scale (152k judgments) human-perception-based sketch database that can evaluate how well a metric consistent with human perception. Our results suggest that \"spatial structure\" and \"co-occurrence texture\" are two generally applicable perceptual features in face sketch synthesis."}

By interpreting the de-raining encoder-decoder network as a conditional generator, within which the decoder acts as a generator conditioned on the embedding learned by the encoder, the unsatisfactory output can be attributed to the low-quality embedding learned by the encoder. In this paper, we hypothesize that there exists an inherent mapping between the low-quality embedding to a latent optimal one, with which the generator (decoder) can produce much better results. To improve the de-raining results significantly over existing models, we propose to learn this mapping by formulating a residual learning branch, that is capable of adaptively adding residuals to the original low-quality embedding in a representation entanglement manner. Using an embedding learned this way, the decoder is able to generate much more satisfactory de-raining results with better detail recovery and rain artefacts removal, providing new state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets with considerable improvement (i.e., on the challenging Rain100H data, an improvement of 4.19dB on PSNR and 5% on SSIM is obtained). The entanglement can be easily adopted into any encoder-decoder based image restoration networks. Besides, we propose a series of evaluation metrics to investigate the specific contribution of the proposed entangled representation learning mechanism. Codes are available at ."}

Aspiring to have one unified structure that hosts diverse types of semantics, we follow the Scene Graph paradigm in 3D, generating a 3D Scene Graph. Given a 3D mesh and registered panoramic images, we construct a graph that spans the entire building and includes semantics on objects (e.g., class, material, shape and other attributes), rooms (e.g., function, illumination type, etc.) and cameras (e.g., location, etc.), as well as the relationships among these entities. However, this process is prohibitively labor heavy if done manually. To alleviate this we devise a semi-automatic framework that employs existing detection methods and enhances them using two main constraints: I. framing of query images sampled on panoramas to maximize the performance of 2D detectors, and II. multi-view consistency enforcement across 2D detections that originate in different camera locations."}

Using floorplan priors, our method jointly predicts a room layout and estimates the transformations from a set of partial 3D data. Unlike the existing methods relying on feature descriptors to establish correspondences, we exploit the 3D \"box\" structure of a typical room layout that meets the Manhattan World property. We first estimate a local layout for each partial scan separately and then combine these local layouts to form a globally aligned layout with loop closure. Without the requirement of feature matching, the proposed method enables some novel applications ranging from large or featureless scene reconstruction and modeling from sparse input. We validate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on real and synthetic scenes of various sizes and complexities. The evaluations and comparisons show superior effectiveness and accuracy of our method."}

GANs allow us to generate a manifold of natural-looking images with fine-grained differences in their visual attributes. By navigating this manifold in directions that increase memorability, we can visualize what it looks like for a particular generated image to become more memorable. The resulting \"visual definitions\" surface image properties (like \"object size\") that may underlie memorability.

Most previous approaches independently embed images and sentences into a joint embedding space and compare their similarities. However, previous approaches rarely explore the interactions between images and sentences before calculating similarities in the joint space. Intuitively, when matching between images and sentences, human beings would alternatively attend to regions in images and words in sentences, and select the most salient information considering the interaction between both modalities. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal Adaptive Message Passing (CAMP), which adaptively controls the information flow for message passing across modalities. Our approach not only takes comprehensive and fine-grained cross-modal interactions into account, but also properly handles negative pairs and irrelevant information with an adaptive gating scheme. Moreover, instead of conventional joint embedding approaches for text-image matching, we infer the matching score based on the fused features, and propose a hardest negative binary cross-entropy loss for training. Results on COCO and Flickr30k significantly surpass state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach."}

In this work, we study this challenging scenario as few-shot image and sentence matching, and accordingly propose an Aligned Cross-Modal Memory (ACMM) model to memorize the rarely appeared content. Given a pair of image and sentence, the model first includes an aligned memory controller network to produce two sets of semantically-comparable interface vectors through cross-modal alignment. Then the interface vectors are used by modality-specific read and update operations to alternatively interact with shared memory items. The memory items persistently memorize cross-modal shared semantic representations, which can be addressed out to better enhance the representation of few-shot content. We apply the proposed model to both conventional and few-shot image and sentence matching tasks, and demonstrate its effectiveness by achieving the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets."}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to dynamic SLAM with dense object-level representations. We represent rigid objects in local volumetric signed distance function (SDF) maps, and formulate multi-object tracking as direct alignment of RGB-D images with the SDF representations. Our main novelty is a probabilistic formulation which naturally leads to strategies for data association and occlusion handling.

While recent factor graph based state optimization algorithms have shown their ability to robustly solve SLAM problems by treating dynamic objects as outliers, the dynamic motions are rarely considered. In this paper, we exploit the consensus of 3D motions among the landmarks extracted from the same rigid body for clustering and estimating static and dynamic objects in a unified manner. Specifically, our algorithm builds a noise-aware motion affinity matrix upon landmarks, and uses agglomerative clustering for distinguishing those rigid bodies. Accompanied by a decoupled factor graph optimization for revising their shape and trajectory, we obtain an iterative scheme to update both cluster assignments and motion estimation reciprocally. Evaluations on both synthetic scenes and KITTI demonstrate the capability of our approach, and further experiments considering online efficiency also show the effectiveness of our method for simultaneous tracking of ego-motion and multiple objects."}

The existing task-specific methods mainly use 2D keypoints (pose) to estimate the human body structure. However, they only expresses the position information with no abilities to characterize the personalized shape of the individual person and model the limbs rotations. In this paper, we propose to use a 3D body mesh recovery module to disentangle the pose and shape, which can not only model the joint location and rotation but also characterize the personalized body shape. To preserve the source information, such as texture, style, color, and face identity, we propose a Liquid Warping GAN with Liquid Warping Block (LWB) that propagates the source information in both image and feature spaces, and synthesizes an image with respect to the reference. Specifically, the source features are extracted by a denoising convolutional auto-encoder for characterizing the source identity well. Furthermore, our proposed method is able to support a more flexible warping from multiple sources. In addition, we build a new dataset, namely Impersonator (iPER) dataset, for the evaluation of human motion imitation, appearance transfer, and novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in several aspects, such as robustness in occlusion case and preserving face identity, shape consistency and clothes details.

Previous methods take an image and some target attributes as inputs and generate an output image with the desired attributes. However, such methods have two limitations. First, these methods assume binary-valued attributes and thus cannot yield satisfactory results for fine-grained control. Second, these methods require specifying the entire set of target attributes, even if most of the attributes would not be changed. To address these limitations, we propose RelGAN, a new method for multi-domain image-to-image translation. The key idea is to use relative attributes, which describes the desired change on selected attributes. Our method is capable of modifying images by changing particular attributes of interest in a continuous manner while preserving the other attributes. Experimental results demonstrate both the quantitative and qualitative effectiveness of our method on the tasks of facial attribute transfer and interpolation."}

Deep neural network architectures in image classification tasks struggle to disambiguate visually similar objects. Likewise, in human pose estimation symmetric body parts often confuse the network with assigning indiscriminative scores to them. This is due to the output prediction, in which only the highest confidence label is selected without taking into consideration a measure of uncertainty. In this work, we define the prediction difficulty as a relative property coming from the confidence score gap between positive and negative labels. More precisely, the proposed loss function penalizes the network to avoid the score of a false prediction being significant. To demonstrate the efficacy of our loss function, we evaluate it on two different domains: image classification and human pose estimation. We find improvements in both applications by achieving higher accuracy compared to the baseline methods."}

We propose the Projection and Rejection Product (PR Product) to make the direction gradient of w independent of the angle and consistently larger than the one in standard inner product while keeping the forward propagation identical. As a reliable substitute for standard inner product, the PR Product can be applied into many existing deep learning modules, so we develop the PR Product version of fully connected layer, convolutional layer and LSTM layer. In static image classification, the experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets demonstrate that the PR Product can robustly enhance the ability of various state-of-the-art classification networks.

They have proved to be effective for guiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts of objects (e.g. leg as opposed to head of a person), thereby letting the network generalize better and have better object localization capabilities. On the other hand, current methods for regional dropout removes informative pixels on training images by overlaying a patch of either black pixels or random noise. Such removal is not desirable because it suffers from information loss causing inefficiency in training. We therefore propose the CutMix augmentation strategy: patches are cut and pasted among training images where the ground truth labels are also mixed proportionally to the area of the patches. By making efficient use of training pixels and retaining the regularization effect of regional dropout, CutMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art augmentation strategies on CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, as well as on ImageNet weakly-supervised localization task. Moreover, unlike previous augmentation methods, our CutMix-trained ImageNet classifier, when used as a pretrained model, results in consistent performance gain in Pascal detection and MS-COCO image captioning benchmarks. We also show that CutMix can improve the model robustness against input corruptions and its out-of distribution detection performance."}

In this work, we explore how to harness the similar natural characteristics existing in the samples from the target domain for learning to conduct person re-ID in an unsupervised manner. Concretely, we propose a Self-similarity Grouping (SSG) approach, which exploits the potential similarity (from the global body to local parts) of unlabeled samples to build multiple clusters from different views automatically. These independent clusters are then assigned with labels, which serve as the pseudo identities to supervise the training process. We repeatedly and alternatively conduct such a grouping and training process until the model is stable.

Applying densely an action recognition system to every temporal clip within such videos is prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, as we show in our experiments, this results in suboptimal recognition accuracy as informative predictions from relevant clips are outnumbered by meaningless classification outputs over long uninformative sections of the video. In this paper we introduce a lightweight \"clip-sampling\" model that can efficiently identify the most salient temporal clips within a long video. We demonstrate that the computational cost of action recognition on untrimmed videos can be dramatically reduced by invoking recognition only on these most salient clips. Furthermore, we show that this yields significant gains in recognition accuracy compared to analysis of all clips or randomly selected clips. On Sports1M, our clip sampling scheme elevates the accuracy of an already state-of-the-art action classifier by 7% and reduces by more than 15 times its computational cost."}

Existing methods typically utilize a two-stage approach including extraction of local spatio-temporal features followed by temporal modeling to capture long-term dependencies. While most recent papers have focused on the latter (long-temporal modeling), here, we focus on producing features capable of modeling fine-grained motion more efficiently. We propose a novel locally-consistent deformable convolution, which utilizes the change in receptive fields and enforces a local coherency constraint to capture motion information effectively. Our model jointly learns spatio-temporal features (instead of using independent spatial and temporal streams). The temporal component is learned from the feature space instead of pixel space, e.g. optical flow. The produced features can be flexibly used in conjunction with other long-temporal modeling networks, e.g. ST-CNN, DilatedTCN, and ED-TCN.

By contrast, our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach is trained to calculate video-to-video similarity from refined frame-to-frame similarity matrices, so as to consider both intra- and inter-frame relations. In the proposed method, pairwise frame similarity is estimated by applying Tensor Dot (TD) followed by Chamfer Similarity (CS) on regional CNN frame features - this avoids feature aggregation before the similarity calculation between frames. Subsequently, the similarity matrix between all video frames is fed to a four-layer CNN, and then summarized using Chamfer Similarity (CS) into a video-to-video similarity score -- this avoids feature aggregation before the similarity calculation between videos and captures the temporal similarity patterns between matching frame sequences. We train the proposed network using a triplet loss scheme and evaluate it on five public benchmark datasets on four different video retrieval problems where we demonstrate large improvements in comparison to the state of the art.

We present a simple meta-learning framework for learning a metric on embeddings that is capable of predicting which feature extractors will perform well on which task. Selecting a feature extractor with task embedding yields performance close to the best available feature extractor, with substantially less computational effort than exhaustively training and evaluating all available models."}

It can be cast as an optimization problem with triplet constraints. Due to the vast number of triplet constraints, a sampling strategy is essential for DML. With the tremendous success of deep learning in classifications, it has been applied for DML. When learning embeddings with deep neural networks (DNNs), only a mini-batch of data is available at each iteration. The set of triplet constraints has to be sampled within the mini-batch. Since a mini-batch cannot capture the neighbors in the original set well, it makes the learned embeddings sub-optimal. On the contrary, optimizing SoftMax loss, which is a classification loss, with DNN shows a superior performance in certain DML tasks. It inspires us to investigate the formulation of SoftMax. Our analysis shows that SoftMax loss is equivalent to a smoothed triplet loss where each class has a single center. In real-world data, one class can contain several local clusters rather than a single one, e.g., birds of different poses. Therefore, we propose the SoftTriple loss to extend the SoftMax loss with multiple centers for each class. Compared with conventional deep metric learning algorithms, optimizing SoftTriple loss can learn the embeddings without the sampling phase by mildly increasing the size of the last fully connected layer. Experiments on the benchmark fine-grained data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function."}

It is able to select nodes that are significant for graph representation adaptively, and generate hierarchical features via aggregating the attention-weighted information in nodes. Additionally, we devise a hierarchical prediction architecture to sufficiently leverage the hierarchical representation and facilitate the model learning. The AttPool module together with the entire training structure can be integrated into existing GCNs, and is trained in an end-to-end fashion conveniently. The experimental results on several graph-classification benchmark datasets with various scales demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}

Although the metric learning part is well addressed, this metric is usually computed over the average of the extracted deep features. This representation is then trained to be discriminative. However, these deep features tend to be scattered across the feature space. Consequently, the representations are not robust to outliers, object occlusions, background variations, etc. In this paper, we tackle this scattering problem with a distribution-aware regularization named HORDE. This regularizer enforces visually-close images to have deep features with the same distribution which are well localized in the feature space. We provide a theoretical analysis supporting this regularization effect. We also show the effectiveness of our approach by obtaining state-of-the-art results on 4 well-known datasets (Cub-200-2011, Cars-196, Stanford Online Products and Inshop Clothes Retrieval)."}

This paper presents an efficient solution that explores the visual patterns within individual cropped regions with minimal costs. We build our framework upon a representative one-stage keypoint-based detector named CornerNet. Our approach, named CenterNet, detects each object as a triplet, rather than a pair, of keypoints, which improves both precision and recall. Accordingly, we design two customized modules, cascade corner pooling, and center pooling, that enrich information collected by both the top-left and bottom-right corners and provide more recognizable information from the central regions. On the MS-COCO dataset, CenterNet achieves an AP of 47.0 %, outperforming all existing one-stage detectors by at least 4.9%. Furthermore, with a faster inference speed than the top-ranked two-stage detectors, CenterNet demonstrates a comparable performance to these detectors.

Optimizing image classification tends to activate object parts and ignore the full object extent, while expanding object parts into full object extent could deteriorate the performance of image classification. In this paper, we propose a divergent activation (DA) approach, and target at learning complementary and discriminative visual patterns for image classification and weakly supervised object localization from the perspective of discrepancy. To this end, we design hierarchical divergent activation (HDA), which leverages the semantic discrepancy to spread feature activation, implicitly. We also propose discrepant divergent activation (DDA), which pursues object extent by learning mutually exclusive visual patterns, explicitly. Deep networks implemented with HDA and DDA, referred to as DANets, diverge and fuse discrepant yet discriminative features for image classification and object localization in an end-to-end manner. Experiments validate that DANets advance the performance of object localization while maintaining high performance of image classification on CUB-200 and ILSVRC datasets"}

From the analyses of the state-of-the-art defense method, i.e., the multi-step adversarial training [??], we hypothesize that the gradient magnitude links to the model robustness. Motivated by this, we propose to perturb both the image and the label during training, which we call Bilateral Adversarial Training (BAT). To generate the adversarial label, we derive an closed-form heuristic solution. To generate the adversarial image, we use one-step targeted attack with the target label being the most confusing class. In the experiment, we first show that random start and the most confusing target attack effectively prevent the label leaking and gradient masking problem. Then coupled with the adversarial label part, our model significantly improves the state-of-the-art results. For example, against PGD100 white-box attack with cross-entropy loss, on CIFAR10, we achieve 63.7% versus 47.2%; on SVHN, we achieve 59.1% versus 42.1%. At last, the experiment on the very (computationally) challenging ImageNet dataset further demonstrates the effectiveness of our fast method."}

In this paper, we study NAS for object detection, a core computer vision task that classifies and localizes object instances in an image. Existing works focus on transferring the searched architecture from classification task (ImageNet) to the detector backbone, while the rest of the architecture of the detector remains unchanged. However, this pipeline is not task-specific or data-oriented network search which cannot guarantee optimal adaptation to any dataset. Therefore, we propose an architecture search framework named Auto-FPN specifically designed for detection beyond simply searching a classification backbone. Specifically, we propose two auto search modules for detection: Auto-fusion to search a better fusion of the multi-level features; Auto-head to search a better structure for classification and bounding-box(bbox) regression. Instead of searching for one repeatable cell structure, we relax the constraint and allow different cells. The search space of both modules covers many popular designs of detectors and allows efficient gradient-based architecture search with resource constraint (2 days for COCO on 8 GPU cards). Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, BDD, VisualGenome and ADE demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, e.g. achieving around 5% improvement than FPN in terms of mAP while requiring around 50% fewer parameters on the searched modules."}

This paper proposes a position-aware relation network (PARN) to learn a more flexible and robust metric ability for few-shot learning. Relation networks (RNs), a kind of architectures for relational reasoning, can acquire a deep metric ability for images by just being designed as a simple convolutional neural network (CNN)[23]. However, due to the inherent local connectivity of CNN, the CNN-based relation network (RN) can be sensitive to the spatial position relationship of semantic objects in two compared images. To address this problem, we introduce a deformable feature extractor (DFE) to extract more efficient features, and design a dual correlation attention mechanism (DCA) to deal with its inherent local connectivity. Successfully, our proposed approach extents the potential of RN to be position-aware of semantic objects by introducing only a small number of parameters. We evaluate our approach on two major benchmark datasets, i.e., Omniglot and Mini-Imagenet, and on both of the datasets our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. It's worth noting that our 5-way 1-shot result on Omniglot even outperforms the previous 5-way 5-shot results."}

The proposed defence mechanism is inspired by the recent works mitigating the adversarial disturbances by the means of image reconstruction and denoising. However, unlike the previous works, we apply the reconstruction only for small and carefully selected image areas that are most influential to the current classification outcome. The selection process is guided by the class activation map responses obtained for multiple top-ranking class labels. The same regions are also the most prominent for the adversarial perturbations and hence most important to purify. The resulting inpainting task is substantially more tractable than the full image reconstruction, while still being able to prevent the adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we combine the selective image inpainting with wavelet based image denoising to produce a non differentiable layer that prevents attacker from using gradient backpropagation. Moreover, the proposed nonlinearity cannot be easily approximated with simple differentiable alternative as demonstrated in the experiments with Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation (BPDA) attack. Finally, we experimentally show that the proposed Class-specific Image Inpainting Defence (CIIDefence) is able to withstand several powerful adversarial attacks including the BPDA. The obtained results are consistently better compared to the other recent defence approaches."}

In the backbone part, we analyze the drawbacks in previous lightweight backbones and present a lightweight backbone designed for object detection. In the detection part, we exploit an extremely efficient RPN and detection head design. To generate more discriminative feature representation, we design two efficient architecture blocks, Context Enhancement Module and Spatial Attention Module. At last, we investigate the balance between the input resolution, the backbone, and the detection head. Benefit from the highly efficient backbone and detection part design, ThunderNet surpasses previous lightweight one-stage detectors with only 40% of the computational cost on PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Without bells and whistles, ThunderNet runs at 24.1 fps on an ARM-based device with 19.2 AP on COCO. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-time detector reported on ARM platforms.

These methods always involve two roles, an explicit or implicit teacher model and a student model, and penalize predictions under different perturbations by a consistency constraint. However, the weights of these two roles are tightly coupled since the teacher is essentially an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student. In this work, we show that the coupled EMA teacher causes a performance bottleneck. To address this problem, we introduce Dual Student, which replaces the teacher with another student. We also define a novel concept, stable sample, following which a stabilization constraint is designed for our structure to be trainable. Further, we discuss two variants of our method, which produce even higher performance. Extensive experiments show that our method improves the classification performance significantly on several main SSL benchmarks. Specifically, it reduces the error rate of the 13-layer CNN from 16.84% to 12.39% on CIFAR-10 with 1k labels and from 34.10% to 31.56% on CIFAR-100 with 10k labels.

Pedestrians across cameras with significant appearance variations are easily confused, which could bias the learned metric and slow down the convergence rate. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted complete bipartite graph based maximum-value perfect (MVP) matching for mining the hard samples from a batch of samples. It can emphasize the hard positive and negative sample pairs respectively, and thus relieve adverse optimization and sample imbalance problems. We then develop a new batch-wise MVP matching based loss objective and combine it in an end-to-end deep metric learning manner. It leads to significant improvements in both convergence rate and recognition performance. Extensive empirical results on five person re-ID benchmark datasets, i.e., Market-1501, CUHK03-Detected, CUHK03-Labeled, Duke-MTMC, and MSMT17, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Our approach draws on an insight connecting two existing works: curriculum domain adaptation and self-training. Inspired by the former, PyCDA constructs a pyramid curriculum which contains various properties about the target domain. Those properties are mainly about the desired label distributions over the target domain images, image regions, and pixels. By enforcing the segmentation neural network to observe those properties, we can improve the network's generalization capability to the target domain. Motivated by the self-training, we infer this pyramid of properties by resorting to the semantic segmentation network itself. Unlike prior work, we do not need to maintain any additional models (e.g., logistic regression or discriminator networks) or to solve minmax problems which are often difficult to optimize. We report state-of-the-art results for the adaptation from both GTAV and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, two popular settings in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation."}

To achieve that, we design a densely connected network with learnable connections, named Fully Dense Network, which contains a large set of possible final connectivity structures. We then employ gradient descent to search the optimal connectivity from the dense connections. The search process is guided by a novel loss function, which pushes the weight of each connection to be binary and the connections to be sparse. The discovered connectivity achieves competitive results on two segmentation datasets, while runs more than three times faster and requires less than half parameters compared to the state-of-the-art methods. An extensive experiment shows that the discovered connectivity is compatible with various backbones and generalizes well to other dense image prediction tasks."}

Face Alignment is an active computer vision domain, that consists in localizing a number of facial landmarks that vary across datasets. State-of-the-art face alignment methods either consist in end-to-end regression, or in refining the shape in a cascaded manner, starting from an initial guess.

DeCaFA uses fully-convolutional stages to keep full spatial resolution throughout the cascade. Between each cascade stage, DeCaFA uses multiple chained transfer layers with spatial softmax to produce landmark-wise attention maps for each of several landmark alignment tasks. Weighted intermediate supervision, as well as efficient feature fusion between the stages allow to learn to progressively refine the attention maps in an end-to-end manner. We show experimentally that DeCaFA significantly outperforms existing approaches on 300W, CelebA and WFLW databases.

Inspired by the point cloud autoencoder presented in self-organizing network (SO-Net), our proposed SO-HandNet aims at making use of the unannotated data to obtain accurate 3D hand pose estimation in a semi-supervised manner. We exploit hand feature encoder (HFE) to extract multi-level features from hand point cloud and then fuse them to regress 3D hand pose by a hand pose estimator (HPE). We design a hand feature decoder (HFD) to recover the input point cloud from the encoded feature. Since the HFE and the HFD can be trained without 3D hand pose annotation, the proposed method is able to make the best of unannotated data during the training phase.

The GridDehazeNet consists of three modules: pre-processing, backbone, and post-processing. The trainable pre-processing module can generate learned inputs with better diversity and more pertinent features as compared to those derived inputs produced by hand-selected pre-processing methods. The backbone module implements a novel attention-based multi-scale estimation on a grid network, which can effectively alleviate the bottleneck issue often encountered in the conventional multi-scale approach. The post-processing module helps to reduce the artifacts in the final output. Experimental results indicate that the GridDehazeNet outperforms the state-of-the-arts on both synthetic and real-world images. The proposed hazing method does not rely on the atmosphere scattering model, and we provide an explanation as to why it is not necessarily beneficial to take advantage of the dimension reduction offered by the atmosphere scattering model for image dehazing, even if only the dehazing results on synthetic images are concerned."}

Yet humans understand a scene not in terms of pixels, but by decomposing it into perceptual groups and structures that are the basic building blocks of recognition. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end pixel-wise metric learning approach that mimics this process. In our approach, the optimal visual representation determines the right segmentation within individual images and associates segments with the same semantic classes across images. The core visual learning problem is therefore to maximize the similarity within segments and minimize the similarity between segments. Given a model trained this way, inference is performed consistently by extracting pixel-wise embeddings and clustering, with the semantic label determined by the majority vote of its nearest neighbors from an annotated set. As a result, we present the SegSort, as a first attempt using deep learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation, achieving 76% performance of its supervised counterpart. When supervision is available, SegSort shows consistent improvements over conventional approaches based on pixel-wise softmax training. Additionally, our approach produces more precise boundaries and consistent region predictions. The proposed SegSort further produces an interpretable result, as each choice of label can be easily understood from the retrieved nearest segments."}

Supervised deep learning methods have made great progress in solving scene parsing problems, however, come at the cost of laborious manual pixel-level annotation. Synthetic data as well as weak supervision have been investigated to alleviate this effort. Nonetheless, synthetically generated data still suffers from severe domain shift while weak labels often lack precision. Moreover, most existing works for weakly supervised scene parsing are limited to salient foreground objects. The aim of this work is hence twofold: Exploit synthetic data where feasible and integrate weak supervision where necessary. More concretely, we address this goal by utilizing depth as transfer domain because its synthetic-to-real discrepancy is much lower than for color. At the same time, we perform weak localization from easily obtainable image level labels and integrate both using a novel contour-based scheme. Our approach is implemented as a teacher-student learning framework to solve the transfer learning problem by generating a pseudo ground truth. Using only depth-based adaptation, this approach already outperforms previous transfer learning approaches on the popular indoor scene parsing SUN RGB-D dataset. Our proposed two-stage integration more than halves the gap towards fully supervised methods when compared to previous state-of-the-art in transfer learning."}

The network adapts to the input point with a help of AdaIN layers [??], thus producing different masks for different objects on the same image. AdaptIS generates pixel-accurate object masks, therefore it accurately segments objects of complex shape or severely occluded ones. AdaptIS can be easily combined with standard semantic segmentation pipeline to perform panoptic segmentation. To illustrate the idea, we perform experiments on a challenging toy problem with difficult occlusions. Then we extensively evaluate the method on panoptic segmentation benchmarks.

For semantic segmentation in particular, it helps deploy on real \"target domain\" data models that are trained on annotated images from a different \"source domain\", notably a virtual environment. To this end, most previous works consider semantic segmentation as the only mode of supervision for source domain data, while ignoring other, possibly available, information like depth. In this work, we aim at exploiting at best such a privileged information while training the UDA model. We propose a unified depth-aware UDA framework that leverages in several complementary ways the knowledge of dense depth in the source domain. As a result, the performance of the trained semantic segmentation model on the target domain is boosted. Our novel approach indeed achieves state-of-the-art performance on different challenging synthetic-2-real benchmarks."}

Given an input, potentially incomplete, 3D scene and a query location, our method predicts a probability distribution over object types that fit well in that location. Our distribution is predicted though passing learned messages in a dense graph whose nodes represent objects in the input scene and edges represent spatial and structural relationships. By weighting messages through an attention mechanism, our method learns to focus on the most relevant surrounding scene context to predict new scene objects. We found that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of correctly predicting objects missing in a scene based on our experiments in the SUNCG dataset. We also demonstrate other applications of our method, including context-based 3D object recognition and iterative scene generation."}

Two words co-occur visually if both words apply to the same image or image region. Specifically, we extract four types of visual co-occurrences between object and attribute words from large-scale, textually-annotated visual databases like VisualGenome and ImageNet. We then train a multi-task log-bilinear model that compactly encodes word \"meanings\" represented by each co-occurrence type into a single visual word-vector. Through unsupervised clustering, supervised partitioning, and a zero-shot-like generalization analysis we show that our word embeddings complement text-only embeddings like GloVe by better representing similarities and differences between visual concepts that are difficult to obtain from text corpora alone. We further evaluate our embeddings on five downstream applications, four of which are vision-language tasks. Augmenting GloVe with our embeddings yields gains on all tasks. We also find that random embeddings perform comparably to learned embeddings on all supervised vision-language tasks, contrary to conventional wisdom."}

We present a conceptually simple, flexible and general framework using sequence to sequence (seq-to-seq) learning for this task. The framework, called Seq-SG2SL, derives sequence proxies for the two modality and a Transformer-based seq-to-seq model learns to transduce one into the other. A scene graph is decomposed into a sequence of semantic fragments (SF), one for each relationship. A semantic layout is represented as the consequence from a series of brick-action code segments (BACS), dictating the position and scale of each object bounding box in the layout. Viewing the two building blocks, SF and BACS, as corresponding terms in two different vocabularies, a seq-to-seq model is fittingly used to translate. A new metric, semantic layout evaluation understudy (SLEU), is devised to evaluate the task of semantic layout prediction inspired by BLEU. SLEU defines relationships within a layout as unigrams and looks at the spatial distribution for n-grams. Unlike the binary precision of BLEU, SLEU allows for some tolerances spatially through thresholding the Jaccard Index and is consequently more adapted to the task. Experimental results on the challenging Visual Genome dataset show improvement over a non-sequential approach based on graph convolution."}

These have two-fold benefits: a) improvement in obtaining the certainty estimates that correlate better with misclassified samples and b) improved attention maps that provide state-of-the-art results in terms of correlation with human attention regions. The improved attention maps result in consistent improvement for various methods for visual question answering. Therefore, the proposed technique can be thought of as a recipe for obtaining improved certainty estimates and explanation for deep learning models. We provide detailed empirical analysis for the visual question answering task on all standard benchmarks and comparison with state of the art methods."}

We use VideoBERT in numerous tasks, including action classification and video captioning. We show that it can be applied directly to open-vocabulary classification, and confirm that large amounts of training data and cross-modal information are critical to performance. Furthermore, we outperform the state-of-the-art on video captioning, and quantitative results verify that the model learns high-level semantic features."}

Many VL approaches treat the language component as an afterthought, using simple language models that are either built upon fixed word embeddings trained on text-only data or are learned from scratch. We conclude that language features deserve more attention, which has been informed by experiments which compare different word embeddings, language models, and embedding augmentation steps on five common VL tasks: image-sentence retrieval, image captioning, visual question answering, phrase grounding, and text-to-clip retrieval. Our experiments provide some striking results; an average embedding language model outperforms a LSTM on retrieval-style tasks; state-of-the-art representations such as BERT perform relatively poorly on vision-language tasks. From this comprehensive set of experiments we can propose a set of best practices for incorporating the language component of vision-language tasks. To further elevate language features, we also show that knowledge in vision-language problems can be transferred across tasks to gain performance with multi-task training. This multi-task training is applied to a new Graph Oriented Vision-Language Embedding (GrOVLE), which we adapt from Word2Vec using WordNet and an original visual-language graph built from Visual Genome, providing a ready-to-use vision-language embedding: http://ai.bu.edu/grovle."}

In this paper, we present an approach which can learn from a small annotated dataset containing a limited range of viewpoints and generalize to detect semantic parts for a much larger range of viewpoints. The approach is based on our matching algorithm, which is used for finding accurate spatial correspondence between two images and transplanting semantic parts annotated on one image to the other. Images in the training set are matched to synthetic images rendered from a 3D CAD model, following which a clustering algorithm is used to automatically annotate semantic parts of the CAD model. During the testing period, this CAD model can synthesize annotated images under every viewpoint. These synthesized images are matched to images in the testing set to detect semantic parts in novel viewpoints. Our algorithm is simple, intuitive, and contains very few parameters. Experiments show our method outperforms standard deep learning approaches and, in particular, performs much better on novel viewpoints.

Most generative models rely on 2D kernels to generate images and make few assumptions about the 3D world. These models therefore tend to create blurry images or artefacts in tasks that require a strong 3D understanding, such as novel-view synthesis. HoloGAN instead learns a 3D representation of the world, and to render this representation in a realistic manner. Unlike other GANs, HoloGAN provides explicit control over the pose of generated objects through rigid-body transformations of the learnt 3D features. Our experiments show that using explicit 3D features enables HoloGAN to disentangle 3D pose and identity, which is further decomposed into shape and appearance, while still being able to generate images with similar or higher visual quality than other generative models. HoloGAN can be trained end-to-end from unlabelled 2D images only. Particularly, we do not require pose labels, 3D shapes, or multiple views of the same objects. This shows that HoloGAN is the first generative model that learns 3D representations from natural images in an entirely unsupervised manner."}

We observe that each pixel in an image corresponds to a surface in the underlying 3D geometry, where a canonical frame can be identified as represented by three orthogonal axes, one along its normal direction and two in its tangent plane. We propose an algorithm to predict these axes from RGB. Our first insight is that canonical frames computed automatically with recently introduced direction field synthesis methods can provide training data for the task. Our second insight is that networks designed for surface normal prediction provide better results when trained jointly to predict canonical frames, and even better when trained to also predict 2D projections of canonical frames. We conjecture this is because projections of canonical tangent directions often align with local gradients in images, and because those directions are tightly linked to 3Dcanonical frames through projective geometry and orthogonality constraints. In our experiments, we find that our method predicts 3D canonical frames that can be used in applications ranging from surface normal estimation, feature matching, and augmented reality."}

In this paper, we present a novel SC-GAN network with end-to-end adversarial training for depth estimation from monocular videos without estimating the camera pose and pose change over time. To exploit cross-frame relations, SC-GAN includes a spatial correspondence module which uses Smolyak sparse grids to efficiently match the features across adjacent frames, and an attention mechanism to learn the importance of features in different directions. Furthermore, the generator in SC-GAN learns to estimate depth from the input frames, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between the ground-truth and estimated depth map for the reference frame.

We consider RIO a particularly important task in 3D vision since it enables a wide range of practical applications, including AI-assistants or robots that are asked to find a specific object in a 3D scene. To address this problem, we first introduce 3RScan, a novel dataset and benchmark, which features 1482 RGB-D scans of 478 environments across multiple time steps. Each scene includes several objects whose positions change over time, together with ground truth annotations of object instances and their respective 6DoF mappings among re-scans. Automatically finding 6DoF object poses leads to a particular challenging feature matching task due to varying partial observations and changes in the surrounding context. To this end, we introduce a new data-driven approach that efficiently finds matching features using a fully-convolutional 3D correspondence network operating on multiple spatial scales.

By inverting such renderer, one can think of a learning approach to infer 3D information from 2D images. However, standard graphics renderers involve a fundamental discretization step called rasterization, which prevents the rendering process to be differentiable, hence able to be learned. Unlike the state-of-the-art differentiable renderers, which only approximate the rendering gradient in the back propagation, we propose a truly differentiable rendering framework that is able to (1) directly render colorized mesh using differentiable functions and (2) back-propagate efficient supervision signals to mesh vertices and their attributes from various forms of image representations, including silhouette, shading and color images. The key to our framework is a novel formulation that views rendering as an aggregation function that fuses the probabilistic contributions of all mesh triangles with respect to the rendered pixels. Such formulation enables our framework to flow gradients to the occluded and far-range vertices, which cannot be achieved by the previous state-of-the-arts. We show that by using the proposed renderer, one can achieve significant improvement in 3D unsupervised single-view reconstruction both qualitatively and quantitatively.

In this paper, we propose a progressive approach that explicitly accounts for the distinct DOFs among the body parts. We model parts with higher DOFs like the elbows, as dependent components of the corresponding parts with lower DOFs like the torso, of which the 3D locations can be more reliably estimated. Meanwhile, the high-DOF parts may, in turn, impose a constraint on where the low-DOF ones lie. As a result, parts with different DOFs supervise one another, yielding physically constrained and plausible pose-estimation results. To further facilitate the prediction of the high-DOF parts, we introduce a pose-attribution estimation, where the relative location of a limb joint with respect to the torso, which has the least DOF of a human body, is explicitly estimated and further fed to the joint-estimation module. The proposed approach achieves very promising results, outperforming the state of the art on several benchmarks."}

In this work, we propose a Global-Local Spherical Harmonics (GLoSH) lighting model to improve the lighting component, and jointly predict reflectance and surface normals. The global SH models the holistic lighting while local SH account for the spatial variation of lighting. Also, a novel non-negative lighting constraint is proposed to encourage the estimated SH to be physically meaningful. To seamlessly reflect the GLoSH model, we design a coarse-to-fine network structure. The coarse network predicts global SH, reflectance and normals, and the fine network predicts their local residuals. Lacking labels for reflectance and lighting, we apply synthetic data for model pre-training and fine-tune the model with real data in a self-supervised way. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods only targeting normals or reflectance and shading, our method recovers all components and achieves consistently better results on three real datasets, IIW, SAW and NYUv2."}

While previous works already show that the features of a trained CNN are suitable descriptors, we show here how to extract the feature locations from the network to build a detector. This information is computed from the gradient of the feature map with respect to the input image. This provides a saliency map with local maxima on relevant keypoint locations. Contrary to recent CNN-based detectors, this method requires neither supervised training nor finetuning. We evaluate how repeatable and how 'matchable' the detected keypoints are with the repeatability and matching scores. Matchability is measured with a simple descriptor introduced for the sake of the evaluation. This novel detector reaches similar performances on the standard evaluation HPatches dataset, as well as comparable robustness against illumination and viewpoint changes on Webcam and photo-tourism images. These results show that a CNN trained on a standard task embeds feature location information that is as relevant as when the CNN is specifically trained for feature detection."}

The embedding quality is usually evaluated by the performance in image search tasks. Since very few users bother to open the second page search results, top-k precision mostly dominates the user experience and thus is one of the crucial evaluation metrics for the embedding quality. Despite being extensively studied, existing algorithms are usually based on heuristic observation without theoretical guarantee. Consequently, gradient descent direction on the training loss is mostly inconsistent with the direction of optimizing the concerned evaluation metric. This inconsistency certainly misleads the training direction and degrades the performance. In contrast to existing works, in this paper, we propose a novel deep image embedding algorithm with end-to-end optimization to top-k precision, the evaluation metric that is closely related to user experience. Specially, our loss function is constructed with wisely selected \"misplaced\" images along the top k nearest neighbor decision boundary, so that the gradient descent update directly promotes the concerned metric, top-k precision. Further more, our theoretical analysis on the upper bounding and consistency properties of the proposed loss supports that minimizing our proposed loss is equivalent to maximizing top-k precision. Experiments show that our proposed algorithm outperforms all compared state-of-the-art deep image embedding algorithms on three benchmark datasets."}

There exist unknown target samples out of the knowledge of source domain. Compared to the close set setting, how to separate the unknown (unshared) class from the known (shared) ones plays the key role. Whereas, previous methods did not emphasize the semantic structure of the open set data, which may introduce bias into the domain alignment and confuse the classifier around the decision boundary. In this paper, we exploit the semantic structure of open set data from two aspects: 1) Semantic Categorical Alignment, which aims to achieve good separability of target known classes by categorically aligning the centroid of target with the source. 2) Semantic Contrastive Mapping, which aims to push the unknown class away from the decision boundary. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method performs favourably against the state-of-the-art methods on representative benchmarks, e.g. Digits and Office-31 datasets."}

However, variability in images is not just due to different depicted object classes, but also depends on other latent characteristics such as viewpoint or illumination. In addition to these structured properties, random noise further obstructs the visual relations of interest. The common approach to metric learning is to enforce a representation that is invariant under all factors but the ones of interest. In contrast, we propose to explicitly learn the latent characteristics that are shared by and go across object classes. We can then directly explain away structured visual variability, rather than assuming it to be unknown random noise. We propose a novel surrogate task to learn visual characteristics shared across classes with a separate encoder. This encoder is trained jointly with the encoder for class information by reducing their mutual information. On five standard image retrieval benchmarks the approach significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art.

This is obtained by adaptively dividing the videos into small segments and comparing two consecutive segments. This allows using pre-trained models on still images for video classification while successfully capturing the spatiotemporal variations in the videos. The adaptive segment selection enables effective encoding of the essential discriminative information of untrimmed videos. Based on Gaussian Scale Mixture, we compute the weights by extracting the mutual information between two consecutive segments. Unlike pooling-based methods, our AWSD gives more importance to the frames that characterize actions or events thanks to its adaptive segment length selection. We conducted extensive experimental analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method and compared our results against those of recent state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datatsets, including UCF101, HMDB51, ActivityNet v1.3, and Maryland. The obtained results on these benchmark datatsets showed that our method significantly outperforms earlier works and sets the new state-of-the-art performance in video classification.

Adversarial sample generation methods range from simple to complex optimization techniques. Majority of these methods generate adversaries through optimization objectives that are tied to the pre-softmax or softmax output of the network. In this work we, (i) show the drawbacks of such attacks, (ii) propose two new evaluation metrics: Old Label New Rank (OLNR) and New Label Old Rank (NLOR) in order to quantify the extent of damage made by an attack, and (iii) propose a new attack FDA: Feature Disruptive attack, to address the drawbacks of existing attacks. FDA works by generating image perturbation that disrupts features at each layer of the network and causes deep-features to be highly corrupt. This allows FDA adversaries to severely reduce the performance of deep networks. We experimentally validate that FDA generates stronger adversaries than other state-of-the-art methods for Image classification, even in the presence of various defense measures. More importantly, we show that FDA disrupts feature-representation based tasks even without access to the task-specific network or methodology."}

A shared common ground among systems which successfully achieve this feat is the integration of previously encountered observations into the current state being estimated. This necessitates the use of a memory module for incorporating previously visited states whilst simultaneously offering an internal representation of the observed environment. In this work we develop a memory module which contains rigidly aligned point-embeddings that represent a coherent scene structure acquired from an RGB-D sequence of observations. The point-embeddings are extracted using modern convolutional neural network architectures, and alignment is performed by computing a dense correspondence matrix between a new observation and the current embeddings residing in the memory module. The whole framework is end-to-end trainable, resulting in a recurrent joint optimisation of the point-embeddings contained in the memory. This process amplifies the shared information across states, providing increased robustness and accuracy. We show significant improvement of our method across a set of experiments performed on the synthetic VIZDoom environment and a real world Active Vision Dataset."}

[??], has been considered as a principle to reveal visual structures under various transformations. It contains the celebrated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a special case that only equivary to the translations. In contrast, we seek to train TERs for a generic class of transformations and train them in an   unsupervised  fashion. To this end, we present a novel principled method by Autoencoding Variational Transformations (AVT), compared with the conventional approach to autoencoding data. Formally, given transformed images, the AVT seeks to train the networks by maximizing the mutual information between the transformations and representations. This ensures the resultant TERs of individual images contain the   intrinsic  information about their visual structures that would equivary   extricably  under various transformations in a generalized   nonlinear  case. Technically, we show that the resultant optimization problem can be efficiently solved by maximizing a variational lower-bound of the mutual information. This variational approach introduces a transformation decoder to approximate the intractable posterior of transformations, resulting in an autoencoding architecture with a pair of the representation encoder and the transformation decoder. Experiments demonstrate the proposed AVT model sets a new record for the performances on unsupervised tasks, greatly closing the performance gap to the supervised models."}

Though multi-mode prior or multi-generator models have been proposed to alleviate this problem, such approaches may fail depending on the empirically chosen initial mode components. In contrast to such bottom-up approaches, we present GAN-Tree, which follows a hierarchical divisive strategy to address such discontinuous multi-modal data. Devoid of any assumption on the number of modes, GAN-Tree utilizes a novel mode-splitting algorithm to effectively split the parent mode to semantically cohesive children modes, facilitating unsupervised clustering. Further, it also enables incremental addition of new data modes to an already trained GAN-Tree, by updating only a single branch of the tree structure. As compared to prior approaches, the proposed framework offers a higher degree of flexibility in choosing a large variety of mutually exclusive and exhaustive tree nodes called GAN-Set. Extensive experiments on synthetic and natural image datasets including ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of GAN-Tree against the prior state-of-the-art."}

In this paper, we propose a novel objective for one-class learning. Our key idea is to use a pair of orthonormal frames -- as subspaces -- to \"sandwich\" the labeled data via optimizing for two objectives jointly: i) minimize the distance between the origins of the two subspaces, and ii) to maximize the margin between the hyperplanes and the data, either subspace demanding the data to be in its positive and negative orthant respectively. Our proposed objective however leads to a non-convex optimization problem, to which we resort to Riemannian optimization schemes and derive an efficient conjugate gradient scheme on the Stiefel manifold. To study the effectiveness of our scheme, we propose a new dataset Dash-Cam-Pose, consisting of clips with skeleton poses of humans seated in a car, the task being to classify the clips as normal or abnormal; the latter is when any human pose is out-of-position with regard to say an airbag deployment. Our experiments on the proposed Dash-Cam-Pose dataset, as well as several other standard anomaly/novelty detection benchmarks demonstrate the benefits of our scheme, achieving state-of-the-art one-class accuracy."}

Though considerable progress has been made, there still exist challenges for objects with small size, arbitrary direction, and dense distribution. Apart from natural images, such issues are especially pronounced for aerial images of great importance. This paper presents a novel multi-category rotation detector for small, cluttered and rotated objects, namely SCRDet. Specifically, a sampling fusion network is devised which fuses multi-layer feature with effective anchor sampling, to improve the sensitivity to small objects. Meanwhile, the supervised pixel attention network and the channel attention network are jointly explored for small and cluttered object detection by suppressing the noise and highlighting the objects feature. For more accurate rotation estimation, the IoU constant factor is added to the smooth L1 loss to address the boundary problem for the rotating bounding box. Extensive experiments on two remote sensing public datasets DOTA, NWPU VHR-10 as well as natural image datasets COCO, VOC2007 and scene text data ICDAR2015 show the state-of-the-art performance of our detector.

Predominant works integrate region proposal mechanisms with convolutional neural networks (CNN). Although CNN is proficient in extracting discriminative local features, grand challenges still exist to measure the likelihood of a bounding box containing a complete object (i.e., \"objectness\"). In this paper, we propose a novel WSOD framework with Objectness Distillation (i.e., WSOD2) by designing a tailored training mechanism for weakly-supervised object detection. Multiple regression targets are specifically determined by jointly considering bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) objectness from low-level measurement and CNN confidences with an adaptive linear combination. As bounding box regression can facilitate a region proposal learning to approach its regression target with high objectness during training, deep objectness representation learned from bottom-up evidences can be gradually distilled into CNN by optimization. We explore different adaptive training curves for BU/TD objectness, and show that the proposed WSOD2 can achieve state-of-the-art results."}

Inspired by great progress of deep learning, deep re-ID models began to be popular and gained state-of-the-art performance. However, recent works found that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing potential threats to DNNs based applications. This phenomenon throws a serious question about whether deep re-ID based systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we take the first attempt to implement robust physical-world attacks against deep re-ID. We propose a novel attack algorithm, called advPattern, for generating adversarial patterns on clothes, which learns the variations of image pairs across cameras to pull closer the image features from the same camera, while pushing features from different cameras farther. By wearing our crafted \"invisible cloak\", an adversary can evade person search, or impersonate a target person to fool deep re-ID models in physical world. We evaluate the effectiveness of our transformable patterns on adversaries' clothes with Market1501 and our established PRCS dataset. The experimental results show that the rank-1 accuracy of re-ID models for matching the adversary decreases from 87.9% to 27.1% under Evading Attack. Furthermore, the adversary can impersonate a target person with 47.1% rank-1 accuracy and 67.9% mAP under Impersonation Attack. The results demonstrate that deep re-ID systems are vulnerable to our physical attacks."}

We advocate the complementary powers of attention and diversity for Re-ID, by proposing an Attentive but Diverse Network (ABD-Net). ABD-Net seamlessly integrates attention modules and diversity regularizations throughout the entire network to learn features that are representative, robust, and more discriminative. Specifically, we introduce a pair of complementary attention modules, focusing on channel aggregation and position awareness, respectively. Then, we plug in a novel orthogonality constraint that efficiently enforces diversity on both hidden activations and weights. Through an extensive set of ablation study, we verify that the attentive and diverse terms each contributes to the performance boosts of ABD-Net. It consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on there popular person Re-ID benchmarks."}

However, the collected images and labeled count values are limited in reality, which means only a small closed set is observed. Existing methods typically model this task in a regression manner, while they are likely to suffer from an unseen scene with counts out of the scope of the closed set. In fact, counting is decomposable. A dense region can always be divided until the count values of sub-regions are within the previously observed closed set. Inspired by this idea, we propose a simple but effective approach, Spatial Divide-and-Conquer Network (S-DCNet). S-DCNet learns to classify closed-set counts and can generalize to open-set counts via S-DC. S-DCNet is also efficient. To avoid repeatedly computing sub-region convolutional features, S-DC is executed on the feature map instead of on the input image. S-DCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three crowd counting datasets (ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50 and UCF-QNRF), a vehicle counting dataset (TRANCOS) and a plant counting dataset (MTC).

However, directly calculating the distances between the query image and support image in existing methods may cause ambiguity because dominant objects can locate anywhere on images. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Semantic Alignment Metric Learning (SAML) method for few-shot learning that aligns the semantically relevant dominant objects through a \"collect-and-select\" strategy. Specifically, we first calculate a relation matrix (RM) to \"collect\" the distances of each local region pairs of the 3D tensor extracted from a query image and the mean tensor of the support images. Then, the attention technique is adapted to \"select\" the semantically relevant pairs and put more weights on them. Afterwards, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is utilized to map the reweighted RMs to their corresponding similarity scores. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the generalization ability of SAML and gives a theoretical guarantee. Empirical results demonstrate that semantic alignment is achieved. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the strengths of the proposed approach and demonstrate that SAML significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

Current video object segmentation methods are frame-based and often require optical flow to capture temporal consistency across frames which can be difficult to compute. To this end, we propose a video based capsule network, CapsuleVOS, which can segment several frames at once conditioned on a reference frame and segmentation mask. This conditioning is performed through a novel routing algorithm for attention-based efficient capsule selection. We address two challenging issues in video object segmentation: 1) segmentation of small objects and 2) occlusion of objects across time. The issue of segmenting small objects is addressed with a zooming module which allows the network to process small spatial regions of the video. Apart from this, the framework utilizes a novel memory module based on recurrent networks which helps in tracking objects when they move out of frame or are occluded. The network is trained end-to-end and we demonstrate its effectiveness on two benchmark video object segmentation datasets; it outperforms current offline approaches on the Youtube-VOS dataset while having a run-time that is almost twice as fast as competing methods.

The unsupervised BAE-NET is trained with a collection of un-segmented shapes, using a shape reconstruction loss, without any ground-truth labels. Specifically, the network takes an input shape and encodes it using a convolutional neural network, whereas the decoder concatenates the resulting feature code with a point coordinate and outputs a value indicating whether the point is inside/outside the shape. Importantly, the decoder is branched: each branch learns a compact representation for one commonly recurring part of the shape collection, e.g., airplane wings. By complementing the shape reconstruction loss with a label loss, BAE-NET is easily tuned for one-shot learning. We show unsupervised, weakly supervised, and one-shot learning results by BAE-NET, demonstrating that using only a couple of exemplars, our network can generally outperform state-of-the-art supervised methods trained on hundreds of segmented shapes.

In order to handle sparse distributions of points, we further employ radial basis functions (RBF) to compute a local, continuous representation within each voxel. Our approach results in a good volumetric representation that effectively tackles noisy point cloud datasets and is more robust for learning. Moreover, we further introduce group equivariant CNN to 3D, by defining the convolution operator on a symmetry group acting on  Z ^3 and its isomorphic sets. This improves the expressive capacity without increasing parameters, leading to more robust segmentation results.We highlight the performance on standard benchmarks and show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms on the ShapeNet and S3DIS datasets."}

This usually needs \"opposite\" strategies to suppress the two terms, and has not been well resolved in the literature. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial learning framework to improve this situation. Departing from the tradition of jointly reducing MD and FA via a single objective, we decompose this difficult task into two sub-tasks handled by two models trained adversarially, with each focusing on reducing either MD or FA. Such a new design brings forth at least three advantages. First, as each model focuses on a relatively simpler sub-task, the overall difficulty of ISOS is somehow decreased. Second, the adversarial training of the two models naturally produces a delicate balance of MD and FA, and low rates for both MD and FA could be achieved at Nash equilibrium. Third, this MD-FA detachment gives us more flexibility to develop specific models dedicated to each sub-task. To realize the above design, we propose a conditional Generative Adversarial Network comprising of two generators and one discriminator. Each generator strives for one sub-task, while the discriminator differentiates the three segmentation results from the two generators and the ground truth. Moreover, in order to better serve the sub-tasks, the two generators, based on context aggregation networks, utilzse different size of receptive fields, providing both local and global views of objects for segmentation. As verified on multiple infrared image data sets, our method consistently achieves better segmentation than many state-of-the-art ISOS methods."}

We also analyse attention deployment mechanisms in the top-down soft attention approach that is argued to mimic human attention in captioning tasks, and investigate whether visual saliency can help image caption- ing. Our study reveals that (1) human attention behaviour differs in free-viewing and image description tasks. Hu- mans tend to fixate on a greater variety of regions under the latter task, (2) there is a strong relationship between de- scribed objects and attended objects (97% of the described objects are being attended), (3) a convolutional neural net- work as feature encoder accounts for human-attended re- gions during image captioning to a great extent (around 78%), (4) soft-attention mechanism differs from human at- tention, both spatially and temporally, and there is low correlation between caption scores and attention consis- tency scores. These indicate a large gap between humans and machines in regards to top-down attention, and (5) by integrating the soft attention model with image saliency, we can significantly improve the model's performance on Flickr30k and MSCOCO benchmarks.

SPLINE-Net contains a lighting interpolation network to generate dense lighting observations given a sparse set of lights as inputs followed by a normal estimation network to estimate surface normals. Both networks are jointly constrained by the proposed symmetric and asymmetric loss functions to enforce isotropic constrain and perform outlier rejection of global illumination effects.

To this end we introduce a novel neural architecture, called OperatorNet, which takes as input a set of linear operators representing a shape and produces its 3D embedding. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms previous purely geometric methods for the same problem. Furthermore, we introduce a novel functional operator, which encodes the extrinsic or pose-dependent shape information, and thus complements purely intrinsic pose-oblivious operators, such as the classical Laplacian. Coupled with this novel operator, our reconstruction network achieves very high reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of incomplete information about a shape, given a soft or functional map expressed in a reduced basis. Finally, we demonstrate that the multiplicative functional algebra enjoyed by these operators can be used to synthesize entirely new unseen shapes, in the context of shape interpolation and shape analogy applications."}

To transfer information between the geometric and semantic branches of the network, we introduce paths between them concatenating features at corresponding network layers. Motivated by the limited amount of training samples from real scenes, an interesting attribute of our architecture is the capacity to supplement the existing dataset by generating a new training dataset with high quality, realistic scenes that even includes occlusion and real noise. We build the new dataset by sampling the features directly from latent space which generates a pair of partial volumetric surface and completed volumetric semantic surface. Moreover, we utilize multiple discriminators to increase the accuracy and realism of the reconstructions. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on standard benchmarks for the two most common completion tasks: semantic 3D scene completion and 3D object completion."}

However, there still exist great challenges when directly applying this technology in indoor environments, e.g., large areas of non-texture regions like white wall, more complex ego-motion of handheld camera, transparent glasses and shiny objects. To overcome these problems, we propose a new optical-flow based training paradigm which reduces the difficulty of unsupervised learning by providing a clearer training target and handles the non-texture regions. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the result of our method is comparable to fully supervised methods on the NYU Depth V2 benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative result of purely unsupervised learning method reported on indoor datasets."}

The intuition behind is to leverage the coupled nature of these two tasks to improve the granularity and performance of scene understanding. We propose to exploit two critical and essential connections between these two tasks: (i) human-object interaction (HOI) to model the fine-grained relations between agents and objects in the scene, and (ii) physical commonsense to model the physical plausibility of the reconstructed scene. The optimal configuration of the 3D scene, represented by a parse graph, is inferred using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which efficiently traverses through the non-differentiable joint solution space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the performance of the two tasks on three datasets, showing an improved generalization ability."}

However, a standard large-scale dataset does not exist, in which different types of modalities across vision and sensors are integrated. To address the disadvantage of vision-based modalities and push towards multi/cross modal action understanding, this paper introduces a new large-scale dataset recorded from 20 distinct subjects with seven different types of modalities: RGB videos, keypoints, acceleration, gyroscope, orientation, Wi-Fi and pressure signal. The dataset consists of more than 36k video clips for 37 action classes covering a wide range of daily life activities such as desktop-related and check-in-based ones in four different distinct scenarios. On the basis of our dataset, we propose a novel multi modality distillation model with attention mechanism to realize an adaptive knowledge transfer from sensor-based modalities to vision-based modalities. The proposed model significantly improves performance of action recognition compared to models trained with only RGB information. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our model on cross-subject, -view, -scene and -session evaluation criteria. We believe that this new large-scale multimodal dataset will contribute the community of multimodal based action understanding."}

We refer to it as HACS (Human Action Clips and Segments). We leverage consensus and disagreement among visual classifiers to automatically mine candidate short clips from unlabeled videos, which are subsequently validated by human annotators. The resulting dataset is dubbed HACS Clips. Through a separate process we also collect annotations defining action segment boundaries. This resulting dataset is called HACS Segments. Overall, HACS Clips consists of 1.5M annotated clips sampled from 504K untrimmed videos, and HACS Segments contains 139K action segments densely annotated in 50K untrimmed videos spanning 200 action categories. HACS Clips contains more labeled examples than any existing video benchmark. This renders our dataset both a large-scale action recognition benchmark and an excellent source for spatiotemporal feature learning. In our transfer learning experiments on three target datasets, HACS Clips outperforms Kinetics-600, Moments-In-Time and Sports1M as a pretraining source. On HACS Segments, we evaluate state-of-the-art methods of action proposal generation and action localization, and highlight the new challenges posed by our dense temporal annotations."}

Most existing methods require laborious frame-level supervision to train action localization models. In this work, we propose a framework, called 3C-Net, which only requires video-level supervision (weak supervision) in the form of action category labels and the corresponding count. We introduce a novel formulation to learn discriminative action features with enhanced localization capabilities. Our joint formulation has three terms: a classification term to ensure the separability of learned action features, an adapted multi-label center loss term to enhance the action feature discriminability and a counting loss term to delineate adjacent action sequences, leading to improved localization. Comprehensive experiments are performed on two challenging benchmarks: THUMOS14 and ActivityNet 1.2. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art for weakly-supervised temporal action localization on both datasets. On the THUMOS14 dataset, the proposed method achieves an absolute gain of 4.6% in terms of mean average precision (mAP), compared to the state-of-the-art.

By contrast, inference in a deep network, requiring a single forward pass, is much faster. Taking advantage of this, we propose a novel architecture to fit a 3D garment template to a 3D body. Specifically, we build upon the recent progress in 3D point cloud processing with deep networks to extract garment features at varying levels of detail, including point-wise, patch-wise and global features. We fuse these features with those extracted in parallel from the 3D body, so as to model the cloth-body interactions. The resulting two-stream architecture, which we call as GarNet, is trained using a loss function inspired by physics-based modeling, and delivers visually plausible garment shapes whose 3D points are, on average, less than 1 cm away from those of a PBS method, while running 100 times faster. Moreover, the proposed method can model various garment types with different cutting patterns when parameters of those patterns are given as input to the network."}

A reoccurring challenge is how to enable a model to generate a rich variety of samples from the entire target distribution, rather than only from a distribution confined to the training data. In other words, we would like the generative model to go beyond the observed samples and learn to generate \"unseen\", yet still plausible, data. In our work, we present CompoNet, a generative neural network for 2D or 3D shapes that is based on a part-based prior, where the key idea is for the network to synthesize shapes by varying both the shape parts and their compositions. Treating a shape not as an unstructured whole, but as a (re-)composable set of deformable parts, adds a combinatorial dimension to the generative process to enrich the diversity of the output, encouraging the generator to venture more into the \"unseen\". We show that our part-based model generates richer variety of plausible shapes compared with baseline generative models. To this end, we introduce two quantitative metrics to evaluate the diversity of a generative model and assess how well the generated data covers both the training data and unseen data from the same target distribution."}

The DDSL is a differentiable layer compatible with deep neural networks for bridging simplex mesh-based geometry representations (point clouds, line mesh, triangular mesh, tetrahedral mesh) with raster images (e.g., 2D/3D grids). The DDSL uses Non-Uniform Fourier Transform (NUFT) to perform differentiable, efficient, anti- aliased rasterization of simplex-based signals. We present a complete theoretical framework for the process as well as an efficient backpropagation algorithm. Compared to previous differentiable renderers and rasterizers, the DDSL generalizes to arbitrary simplex degrees and dimensions. In particular, we explore its applications to 2D shapes and illustrate two applications of this method: (1) mesh editing and optimization guided by neural network outputs, and (2) using DDSL for a differentiable rasterization loss to facilitate end-to-end training of polygon generators. We are able to validate the effectiveness of gradient-based shape optimization with the example of airfoil optimization, and using the differentiable rasterization loss to facilitate end-to-end training, we surpass state of the art for polygonal image segmentation given ground-truth bounding boxes."}

However, most existing FCNs-based methods still suffer from coarse object boundaries. In this paper, to solve this problem, we focus on the complementarity between salient edge information and salient object information. Accordingly, we present an edge guidance network (EGNet) for salient object detection with three steps to simultaneously model these two kinds of complementary information in a single network. In the first step, we extract the salient object features by a progressive fusion way. In the second step, we integrate the local edge information and global location information to obtain the salient edge features. Finally, to sufficiently leverage these complementary features, we couple the same salient edge features with salient object features at various resolutions. Benefiting from the rich edge information and location information in salient edge features, the fused features can help locate salient objects, especially their boundaries more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on six widely used datasets without any pre-processing and post-processing.

We have used Free-Viewing and Visual Search task instructions and 7 feature contrasts for each feature category. Our study reveals that state-of-the-art Deep Learning saliency models do not perform well with synthetic pattern images, instead, models with Spectral/Fourier inspiration outperform others in saliency metrics and are more consistent with human psychophysical experimentation. This study proposes a new way to evaluate saliency models in the forthcoming literature, accounting for synthetic images with uniquely low-level feature contexts, distinct from previous eye tracking image datasets."}

DeblurGAN-V2 is based on a relativistic conditional GAN with a double-scale discriminator. For the first time, we introduce the Feature Pyramid Network into deblurring, as a core building block in the generator of DeblurGAN-V2. It can flexibly work with a wide range of backbones, to navigate the balance between performance and efficiency. The plug-in of sophisticated backbones (e.g. Inception ResNet v2) can lead to solid state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, with light-weight backbones (e.g. MobileNet and its variants), DeblurGAN-V2 becomes 10-100 times faster than the nearest competitors, while maintaining close to state-of-the-art results, implying the option of real-time video deblurring. We demonstrate that DeblurGAN-V2 has very competitive performance on several popular benchmarks, in terms of deblurring quality (both objective and subjective), as well as efficiency.

However, much of the research has been limited to approaches that either do not take audio corresponding to video into account at all, or those that model the audio-visual correlations in service of sound or sound source localization. In this paper, we present the evidence, that audio signals can carry surprising amount of information when it comes to high-level visual-lingual tasks. Specifically, we focus on the problem of weakly-supervised dense event captioning in videos and show that audio on its own can nearly rival performance of a state-of-the-art visual model and, combined with video, can improve on the state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions dataset show that our proposed multi-modal approach outperforms state-of-the-art unimodal methods, as well as validate specific feature representation and architecture design choices."}

We first build a large scale, carefully controlled dataset of human utterances each of which refers to a 2D rendering of a 3D CAD model so as to distinguish it from a set of shape-wise similar alternatives. Using this dataset, we develop neural language understanding (listening) and production (speaking) models that vary in their grounding (pure 3D forms via point-clouds vs. rendered 2D images), the degree of pragmatic reasoning captured (e.g. speakers that reason about a listener or not), and the neural architecture (e.g. with or without attention). We find models that perform well with both synthetic and human partners, and with held out utterances and objects. We also find that these models are capable of zero-shot transfer learning to novel object classes (e.g. transfer from training on chairs to testing on lamps), as well as to real-world images drawn from furniture catalogs. Lesion studies indicate that the neural listeners depend heavily on part-related words and associate these words correctly with visual parts of objects (without any explicit supervision on such parts), and that transfer to novel classes is most successful when known part-related words are available. This work illustrates a practical approach to language grounding, and provides a novel case study in the relationship between object shape and linguistic structure when it comes to object differentiation."}

To encourage the development of image captioning models that can learn visual concepts from alternative data sources, such as object detection datasets, we present the first large-scale benchmark for this task. Dubbed 'nocaps', for novel object captioning at scale, our benchmark consists of 166,100 human-generated captions describing 15,100 images from the Open Images validation and test sets. The associated training data consists of COCO image-caption pairs, plus Open Images image-level labels and object bounding boxes. Since Open Images contains many more classes than COCO, nearly 400 object classes seen in test images have no or very few associated training captions (hence, nocaps). We extend existing novel object captioning models to establish strong baselines for this benchmark and provide analysis to guide future work."}

Similarly to prior work, our method learns by applying differentiable warping to frames and comparing the result to adjacent ones, but it provides several improvements: We address occlusions geometrically and differentiably, directly using the depth maps as predicted during training. We introduce randomized layer normalization, a novel powerful regularizer, and we account for object motion relative to the scene. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to learn the camera intrinsic parameters, including lens distortion, from video in an unsupervised manner, thereby allowing us to extract accurate depth and motion from arbitrary videos of unknown origin at scale. We evaluate our results on the Cityscapes, KITTI and EuRoC datasets, establishing new state of the art on depth prediction and odometry, and demonstrate qualitatively that depth prediction can be learned from a collection of YouTube videos.

To recognize Chinese text in the wild while keeping large-scale datasets labeling cost-effective, we propose to annotate one part of the C-SVT dataset (30,000 images) in locations and text labels as full annotations and add 400,000 more images, where only the corresponding text-of-interest in the regions is given as weak annotations. To exploit the rich information from the weakly annotated data, we design a text reading network in a partially supervised learning framework, which enables to localize and recognize text, learn from fully and weakly annotated data simultaneously. To localize the best matched text proposals from weakly labeled images, we propose an online proposal matching module incorporated in the whole model, spotting the keyword regions by sharing parameters for end-to-end training. Compared with fully supervised training algorithms, this model can improve the end-to-end recognition performance remarkably by 4.03% in F-score at the same labeling cost.

Moreover, we obtain this result after training on only one GPU. We accomplish this by breaking instance segmentation into two parallel subtasks: (1) generating a set of prototype masks and (2) predicting per-instance mask coefficients. Then we produce instance masks by linearly combining the prototypes with the mask coefficients. We find that because this process doesn't depend on repooling, this approach produces very high-quality masks and exhibits temporal stability for free. Furthermore, we analyze the emergent behavior of our prototypes and show they learn to localize instances on their own in a translation variant manner, despite being fully-convolutional. Finally, we also propose Fast NMS, a drop-in 12 ms faster replacement for standard NMS that only has a marginal performance penalty."}

Few-shot segmentation has thus been developed to learn to perform segmentation from only a few annotated examples. In this paper, we tackle the challenging few-shot segmentation problem from a metric learning perspective and present PANet, a novel prototype alignment network to better utilize the information of the support set. Our PANet learns class-specific prototype representations from a few support images within an embedding space and then performs segmentation over the query images through matching each pixel to the learned prototypes. With non-parametric metric learning, PANet offers high-quality prototypes that are representative for each semantic class and meanwhile discriminative for different classes. Moreover, PANet introduces a prototype alignment regularization between support and query. With this, PANet fully exploits knowledge from the support and provides better generalization on few-shot segmentation.

Most existing methods rely on precise mask annotations of every category. However, it is difficult and costly to segment objects in novel categories because a large number of mask annotations is required. We introduce ShapeMask, which learns the intermediate concept of object shape to address the problem of generalization in instance segmentation to novel categories. ShapeMask starts with a bounding box detection and gradually refines it by first estimating the shape of the detected object through a collection of shape priors. Next, ShapeMask refines the coarse shape into an instance level mask by learning instance embeddings. The shape priors provide a strong cue for object-like prediction, and the instance embeddings model the instance specific appearance information. ShapeMask significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by 6.4 and 3.8 AP when learning across categories, and obtains competitive performance in the fully supervised setting. It is also robust to inaccurate detections, decreased model capacity, and small training data. Moreover, it runs efficiently with 150ms inference time on a GPU and trains within 11 hours on TPUs. With a larger backbone model, ShapeMask increases the gap with state-of-the-art to 9.4 and 6.2 AP across categories.

We propose two ways to construct spatiotemporal neighborhoods for each point in the point cloud sequence. Information from these neighborhoods is aggregated to learn features per point. We benchmark our network on a variety of 3D recognition tasks including action recognition, semantic segmentation and scene flow estimation. MeteorNet shows stronger performance than previous grid-based methods while achieving state-of-the-art performance on Synthia. MeteorNet also outperforms previous baseline methods that are able to process at most two consecutive point clouds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on deep learning for dynamic raw point cloud sequences."}

Their success benefited from a massive boost when very deep CNN models were able to be reliably trained. Despite their merits, CNNs fail to properly address problems with non-Euclidean data. To overcome this challenge, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) build graphs to represent non-Euclidean data, borrow concepts from CNNs, and apply them in training. GCNs show promising results, but they are usually limited to very shallow models due to the vanishing gradient problem. As a result, most state-of-the-art GCN models are no deeper than 3 or 4 layers. In this work, we present new ways to successfully train very deep GCNs. We do this by borrowing concepts from CNNs, specifically residual/dense connections and dilated convolutions, and adapting them to GCN architectures. Extensive experiments show the positive effect of these deep GCN frameworks. Finally, we use these new concepts to build a very deep 56-layer GCN, and show how it significantly boosts performance (+3.7% mIoU over state-of-the-art) in the task of point cloud semantic segmentation. We believe that the community can greatly benefit from this work, as it opens up many opportunities for advancing GCN-based research."}

Generally, the combination of expensive LiDAR sensors and stereo RGB imaging has been paramount for successful 3D object detection algorithms, whereas monocular image-only methods experience drastically reduced performance. We propose to reduce the gap by reformulating the monocular 3D detection problem as a standalone 3D region proposal network. We leverage the geometric relationship of 2D and 3D perspectives, allowing 3D boxes to utilize well-known and powerful convolutional features generated in the image-space. To help address the strenuous 3D parameter estimations, we further design depth-aware convolutional layers which enable location specific feature development and in consequence improved 3D scene understanding. Compared to prior work in monocular 3D detection, our method consists of only the proposed 3D region proposal network rather than relying on external networks, data, or multiple stages. M3D-RPN is able to significantly improve the performance of both monocular 3D Object Detection and Bird's Eye View tasks within the KITTI urban autonomous driving dataset, while efficiently using a shared multi-class model."}

In particular, self-driving cars need a fine-grained understanding of the surfaces and objects in their vicinity. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) provides precise geometric information about the environment and is thus a part of the sensor suites of almost all self-driving cars. Despite the relevance of semantic scene understanding for this application, there is a lack of a large dataset for this task which is based on an automotive LiDAR. In this paper, we introduce a large dataset to propel research on laser-based semantic segmentation. We annotated all sequences of the KITTI Vision Odometry Benchmark and provide dense point-wise annotations for the complete 360-degree field-of-view of the employed automotive LiDAR. We propose three benchmark tasks based on this dataset: (i) semantic segmentation of point clouds using a single scan, (ii) semantic segmentation using multiple past scans, and (iii) semantic scene completion, which requires to anticipate the semantic scene in the future. We provide baseline experiments and show that there is a need for more sophisticated models to efficiently tackle these tasks. Our dataset opens the door for the development of more advanced methods, but also provides plentiful data to investigate new research directions."}

While a variety of CNN architectures and loss functions have been devised recently, we still have a limited understanding of how to train the CNN models with the label noise inherent in existing face recognition datasets. To address this issue, this paper develops a novel co-mining strategy to effectively train on the datasets with noisy labels. Specifically, we simultaneously use the loss values as the cue to detect noisy labels, exchange the high-confidence clean faces to alleviate the errors accumulated issue caused by the sample-selection bias, and re-weight the predicted clean faces to make them dominate the discriminative model training in a mini-batch fashion. Extensive experiments by training on three popular datasets (i.e., CASIA-WebFace, MS-Celeb-1M and VggFace2) and testing on several benchmarks, including LFW, AgeDB, CFP, CALFW, CPLFW, RFW, and MegaFace, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our new approach over the state-of-the-art alternatives."}

However, the aging process of each individual is more dominated by his/her personalized factors, including the invariant factors such as identity and mole, as well as the personalized aging patterns, e.g., one may age by graying hair while another may age by receding hairline. Following this biological principle, in this work, we propose an effective and efficient method to simulate natural aging. Specifically, a personalized aging basis is established for each individual to depict his/her own aging factors. Then different ages share this basis, being derived through age-specific transforms. The age-specific transforms represent the aging trends which are shared among all individuals. The proposed method can achieve continuous face aging with favorable aging accuracy, identity preservation, and fidelity. Furthermore, befitted from the effective design, a unique model is capable of all ages and the prediction time is significantly saved."}

As an example, we train our model to manipulate the expression of a human face using nonphotorealistic 3D renders of a face with varied expression. Our model manages to preserve all other visual attributes of a real face, such as head orientation, even though this and other attributes are not labeled in either real or synthetic domain. Since our model learns to manipulate a specific property in isolation using only \"synthetic demonstrations\" of such manipulations without explicitly provided labels, it can be applied to shape, texture, lighting, and other properties that are difficult to measure or represent as real-valued vectors. We measure the degree to which our model preserves other attributes of a real image when a single specific attribute is manipulated. We use digit datasets to analyze how discrepancy in attribute distributions affects the performance of our model, and demonstrate results in a far more difficult setting: learning to manipulate real human faces using nonphotorealistic 3D renders."}

However, how to efficiently represent both of them in images is still an open question. In this paper, we propose the Triplet Representation for Body (TRB) --- a compact 2D human body representation, with skeleton keypoints capturing human pose information and contour keypoints containing human shape information. TRB not only preserves the flexibility of skeleton keypoint representation, but also contains rich pose and human shape information. Therefore, it promises broader application areas, such as human shape editing and conditional image generation. We further introduce the challenging problem of TRB estimation, where joint learning of human pose and shape is required. We construct several large-scale TRB estimation datasets, based on the popular 2D pose datasets LSP, MPII and COCO. To effectively solve TRB estimation, we propose a two-branch network (TRB-net) with three novel techniques, namely X-structure (Xs), Directional Convolution (DC) and Pairwise mapping (PM), to enforce multi-level message passing for joint feature learning. We evaluate our proposed TRB-net and several leading approaches on our proposed TRB datasets, and demonstrate the superiority of our method through extensive evaluations."}

To reduce the dependence on expensive bounding box annotations, we propose a new semi-supervised object detection formulation, in which a few seed box level annotations and a large scale of image level annotations are used to train the detector. We adopt a training-mining framework, which is widely used in weakly supervised object detection tasks. However, the mining process inherently introduces various kinds of labelling noises: false negatives, false positives and inaccurate boundaries, which can be harmful for training the standard object detectors (e.g. Faster RCNN). We propose a novel NOise Tolerant Ensemble RCNN (NOTE-RCNN) object detector to handle such noisy labels. Comparing to standard Faster RCNN, it contains three highlights: an ensemble of two classification heads and a distillation head to avoid overfitting on noisy labels and improve the mining precision, masking the negative sample loss in box predictor to avoid the harm of false negative labels, and training box regression head only on seed annotations to eliminate the harm from inaccurate boundaries of mined bounding boxes. We evaluate the methods on ILSVRC 2013 and MSCOCO 2017 dataset; we observe that the detection accuracy consistently improves as we iterate between mining and training steps, and state-of-the-art performance is achieved."}

We observe that if backgrounds in the training and testing datasets are very different, it dramatically introduces difficulties to extract robust pedestrian features, and thus compromises the cross-domain person re-ID performance. In this paper, we formulate such problems as a background shift problem. A Suppression of Background Shift Generative Adversarial Network (SBSGAN) is proposed to generate images with suppressed backgrounds. Unlike simply removing backgrounds using binary masks, SBSGAN allows the generator to decide whether pixels should be preserved or suppressed to reduce segmentation errors caused by noisy foreground masks. Additionally, we take ID-related cues, such as vehicles and companions into consideration. With high-quality generated images, a Densely Associated 2-Stream (DA-2S) network is introduced with Inter Stream Densely Connection (ISDC) modules to strengthen the complementarity of the generated data and ID-related cues. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance on three re-ID datasets, i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and CUHK03, under the cross-domain person re-ID scenario."}

In this work, we present a flexible and general methodology to achieve these tasks. Our work extends Faster /Mask R-CNN by proposing meta-learning over RoI (Region-of-Interest) features instead of a full image feature. This simple spirit disentangles multi-object information merged with the background, without bells and whistles, enabling Faster /Mask R-CNN turn into a meta-learner to achieve the tasks.

PRN receives images containing low-shot objects with their bounding boxes or masks to infer their class attentive vectors. The vectors take channel-wise soft-attention on RoI features, remodeling those R-CNN predictor heads to detect or segment the objects consistent with the classes these vectors represent.

In this paper, we propose a practical object detection with scale-sensitive network.Our method first predicts a global continuous scale ,which shared by all position, for each convolution filter of each network stage. To effectively learn the scale, we average the spatial features and distill the scale from channels. For fast-deployment, we propose a scale decomposition method that transfers the robust fractional scale into combinations of fixed integral scales for each convolution filter, which exploit the dilated convolution. We demonstrate it on one-stage and two-stage algorithm under almost different configure.

Almost all state-of-the-art object detectors such as RetinaNet, SSD, YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN rely on pre-defined anchor boxes. In contrast, our proposed detector FCOS is anchor box free, as well as proposal free. By eliminating the pre-defined set of anchor boxes, FCOS completely avoids the complicated computation related to anchor boxes such as calculating overlapping during training. More importantly, we also avoid all hyper-parameters related to anchor boxes, which are often very sensitive to the final detection performance. With the only post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS), FCOS with ResNeXt-64x4d-101 achieves 44.7% in AP with single-model and single-scale testing, surpassing previous one-stage detectors with the advantage of being much simpler.

Firstly, We extract the local semantic features by introducing a novel high-speed video segmentation framework. Then by the guide of extracted semantic features, a bottom-up visual attention mechanism is proposed for the Visual Question Answering (VQA) sub-task.

However, straightforward approaches to using such data for WSOD wastefully discard captions that do not exactly match object names. Instead, we show how to squeeze the most information out of these captions by training a text-only classifier that generalizes beyond dataset boundaries. Our discovery provides an opportunity for learning detection models from noisy but more abundant and freely-available caption data.

One way to alleviate this issue is to enhance the features of small RoIs using a super-resolution (SR) technique. We investigate how to improve feature-level super-resolution especially for small object detection, and discover its performance can be significantly improved by (i) utilizing proper high-resolution target features as supervision signals for training of a SR model and (ii) matching the relative receptive fields of training pairs of input low-resolution features and target high-resolution features. We propose a novel feature-level super-resolution approach that not only correctly addresses these two desiderata but also is integrable with any proposal-based detectors with feature pooling. In our experiments, our approach significantly improves the performance of Faster R-CNN on three benchmarks of Tsinghua-Tencent 100K, PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. The improvement for small objects is remarkably large, and encouragingly, those for medium and large objects are nontrivial too.

Instead of processing an entire image pyramid, AutoFocus adopts a coarse to fine approach and only processes regions which are likely to contain small objects at finer scales. This is achieved by predicting category agnostic segmentation maps for small objects at coarser scales, called FocusPixels. FocusPixels can be predicted with high recall, and in many cases, they only cover a small fraction of the entire image. To make efficient use of FocusPixels, an algorithm is proposed which generates compact rectangular FocusChips which enclose FocusPixels. The detector is only applied inside FocusChips, which reduces computation while processing finer scales. Different types of error can arise when detections from FocusChips of multiple scales are combined, hence techniques to correct them are proposed. AutoFocus obtains an mAP of 47.9% (68.3% at 50% overlap) on the COCO test-dev set while processing 6.4 images per second on a Titan X (Pascal) GPU. This is 2.5X faster than our multi-scale baseline detector and matches its mAP. The number of pixels processed in the pyramid can be reduced by 5X with a 1% drop in mAP. AutoFocus obtains more than 10% mAP gain compared to RetinaNet but runs at the same speed with the same ResNet-101 backbone."}

State-of-the-art methods such as Faster-RCNN, FPN and R-FCN have achieved high accuracy in challenging benchmark datasets. However, these methods require fully annotated object bounding boxes for training, which are incredibly hard to scale up due to the high annotation cost. Weakly-supervised methods, on the other hand, only require image-level labels for training, but the performance is far below their fully-supervised counterparts. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised large scale fine-grained detection method, which only needs bounding box annotations of a smaller number of coarse-grained classes and image-level labels of large scale fine-grained classes, and can detect all classes at nearly fully-supervised accuracy. We achieve this by utilizing the correlations between coarse-grained and fine-grained classes with shared backbone, soft-attention based proposal re-ranking, and a dual-level memory module. Experiment results show that our methods can achieve close accuracy on object detection to state-of-the-art fully-supervised methods on two large scale datasets, ImageNet and OpenImages, with only a small fraction of fully annotated classes."}

This network can be trained end-to-end, and can be supervised with both ground truth camera poses and intermediate representations of surface geometry.

The key idea is to train a deep neural network to generate 3D shapes which, when rendered to images, are indistinguishable from ground truth images (for a discriminator) under various camera poses. Discriminating 2D images instead of 3D shapes allows tapping into unstructured 2D photo collections instead of relying on curated (e.g., aligned, annotated, etc.) 3D data sets. To establish constraints between 2D image observation and their 3D interpretation, we suggest a family of rendering layers that are effectively differentiable. This family includes visual hull, absorption-only (akin to x-ray), and emission-absorption. We can successfully reconstruct 3D shapes from unstructured 2D images and extensively evaluate PlatonicGAN on a range of synthetic and real data sets achieving consistent improvements over baseline methods.

In this context, the design of descriptors that efficiently and uniquely identifies keypoints, to be matched, is of central importance. Numerous descriptors have been developed for dealing with affine/perspective warps, but few can also handle non-rigid deformations. In this paper, we introduce a novel binary RGB-D descriptor invariant to isometric deformations. Our method uses geodesic isocurves on smooth textured manifolds. It combines appearance and geometric information from RGB-D images to tackle non-rigid transformations. We used our descriptor to track multiple textured depth maps and demonstrate that it produces reliable feature descriptors even in the presence of strong non-rigid deformations and depth noise. The experiments show that our descriptor outperforms different state-of-the-art descriptors in both precision-recall and recognition rate metrics. We also provide to the community a new dataset composed of annotated RGB-D images of different objects (shirts, cloths, paintings, bags), subjected to strong non-rigid deformations, to evaluate point correspondence algorithms."}

CDTB is recorded by several passive and active RGB-D setups and contains indoor as well as outdoor sequences acquired in direct sunlight. The CDTB dataset is the largest and most diverse dataset in RGB-D tracking, with an order of magnitude larger number of frames than related datasets. The sequences have been carefully recorded to contain significant object pose change, clutter, occlusion, and periods of long-term target absence to enable tracker evaluation under realistic conditions. Sequences are per-frame annotated with 13 visual attributes for detailed analysis. Experiments with RGB and RGB-D trackers show that CDTB is more challenging than previous datasets. State-of-the-art RGB trackers outperform the recent RGB-D trackers, indicating a large gap between the two fields, which has not been previously detected by the prior benchmarks. Based on the results of the analysis we point out opportunities for future research in RGB-D tracker design."}

In this work, we propose Additive Focal Variational Auto-encoder (AF-VAE), a novel approach that can arbitrarily manipulate high-resolution face images using a simple yet effective model and only weak supervision of reconstruction and KL divergence losses. First, a novel additive Gaussian Mixture assumption is introduced with an unsupervised clustering mechanism in the structural latent space, which endows better disentanglement and boosts multi-modal representation with external memory. Second, to improve the perceptual quality of synthesized results, two simple strategies in architecture design are further tailored and discussed on the behavior of Human Visual System (HVS) for the first time, allowing for fine control over the model complexity and sample quality. Human opinion studies and new state-of-the-art Inception Score (IS) / Frechet Inception Distance (FID) demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing algorithms, advancing both the fidelity and extremity of face manipulation task."}

These jointly occurred angle variations make face recognition challenging. Current public face databases mainly consider the case of yaw variations. In this paper, a new large-scale Multi-yaw Multi-pitch high-quality database is proposed for Facial Pose Analysis (M2FPA), including face frontalization, face rotation, facial pose estimation and pose-invariant face recognition. It contains 397,544 images of 229 subjects with yaw, pitch, attribute, illumination and accessory. M2FPA is the most comprehensive multi-view face database for facial pose analysis. Further, we provide an effective benchmark for face frontalization and pose-invariant face recognition on M2FPA with several state-of-the-art methods, including DR-GAN, TP-GAN and CAPG-GAN. We believe that the new database and benchmark can significantly push forward the advance of facial pose analysis in real-world applications. Moreover, a simple yet effective parsing guided discriminator is introduced to capture the local consistency during GAN optimization. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results on M2FPA and Multi-PIE demonstrate the superiority of our face frontalization method. Baseline results for both face synthesis and face recognition from state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the challenge offered by this new database."}

These methods incorporate a fixed additive margin to all the classes, ignoring the class imbalance problem. However, imbalanced problem widely exists in various real-world face datasets, in which samples from some classes are in a higher number than others. We argue that the number of a class would influence its demand for the additive margin. In this paper, we introduce a new margin-aware reinforcement learning based loss function, namely fair loss, in which each class will learn an appropriate adaptive margin by Deep Q-learning. Specifically, we train an agent to learn a margin adaptive strategy for each class, and make the additive margins for different classes more reasonable. Our method has better performance than present large-margin loss functions on three benchmarks, Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW), Youtube Faces (YTF) and MegaFace, which demonstrates that our method could learn better face representation on imbalanced face datasets."}

The generator consists of multiple progressive steps. At each step a shadow attention detector is firstly exploited to generate an attention map which specifies shadow regions in the input image. Given the attention map, a negative residual by a shadow remover encoder will recover a shadow-lighter or even a shadow-free image. The discriminator is designed to classify whether the output image in the last progressive step is real or fake. Moreover, ARGAN is suitable to be trained with a semi-supervised strategy to make full use of sufficient unsupervised data. The experiments on four public datasets have demonstrated that our ARGAN is robust to detect both simple and complex shadows and to produce more realistic shadow removal results. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially in detail of recovering shadow areas."}

We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm has an ability to escape poor local minima that is on par with the best performing algorithms with a faster decrease of the target objective."}

In order to robustly handle ambiguities, noise and repetitive patterns in challenging real-world settings, it is essential to take geometric consistency between points into account. Computationally, the multi-matching problem is difficult. It can be phrased as simultaneously solving multiple (NP-hard) quadratic assignment problems (QAPs) that are coupled via cycle-consistency constraints. The main limitations of existing multi-matching methods are that they either ignore geometric consistency and thus have limited robustness, or they are restricted to small-scale problems due to their (relatively) high computational cost. We address these shortcomings by introducing a Higher-order Projected Power Iteration method, which is (i) efficient and scales to tens of thousands of points, (ii) straightforward to implement, (iii) able to incorporate geometric consistency, (iv) guarantees cycle-consistent multi-matchings, and (iv) comes with theoretical convergence guarantees. Experimentally we show that our approach is superior to existing methods."}

Existing research has primarily focused on generating a single image from available conditioning information in one step. One practical extension beyond one-step generation is a system that generates an image iteratively, conditioned on ongoing linguistic input or feedback. This is significantly more challenging than one-step generation tasks, as such a system must understand the contents of its generated images with respect to the feedback history, the current feedback, as well as the interactions among concepts present in the feedback history. In this work, we present a recurrent image generation model which takes into account both the generated output up to the current step as well as all past instructions for generation. We show that our model is able to generate the background, add new objects, and apply simple transformations to existing objects.

Suffering from the high predictability with non-visual information, relationship models tend to fit the statistical bias rather than \"learning\" to infer the relationships from images. To encourage further development in visual relationships, we propose a novel method to mine more valuable relationships by automatically pruning visually-irrelevant relationships. We construct a new scene graph dataset named Visually-Relevant Relationships Dataset (VrR-VG) based on Visual Genome. Compared with existing datasets, the performance gap between learnable and statistical method is more significant in VrR-VG, and frequency-based analysis does not work anymore. Moreover, we propose to learn a relationship-aware representation by jointly considering instances, attributes and relationships. By applying the representation-aware feature learned on VrR-VG, the performances of image captioning and visual question answering are systematically improved, which demonstrates the effectiveness of both our dataset and features embedding schema. Both our VrR-VG dataset and representation-aware features will be made publicly available soon."}

This approach relies on photo-consistency to evaluate the goodness of a depth estimate. It generally produces very accurate results; however, the reconstructed model often lacks completeness, especially in correspondence of broad untextured areas where the photo-consistency metrics are unreliable. Assuming the untextured areas piecewise planar, in this paper we generate novel PatchMatch hypotheses so to expand reliable depth estimates in neighboring untextured regions. At the same time, we modify the photo-consistency measure such to favor standard or novel PatchMatch depth hypotheses depending on the textureness of the considered area. We also propose a depth refinement step to filter wrong estimates and to fill the gaps on both the depth maps and normal maps while preserving the discontinuities. The effectiveness of our new methods has been tested against several state of the art algorithms in the publicly available ETH3D dataset containing a wide variety of high and low-resolution images."}

We further leverage recent advances in 3D pose estimation to constrain the joint semantic instance segmentation and 4D temporally coherent reconstruction. This enables per person semantic instance segmentation of multiple interacting people in complex dynamic scenes. Extensive evaluation of the joint visual scene understanding framework against state-of-the-art methods on challenging indoor and outdoor sequences demonstrates a significant (approx 40%) improvement in semantic segmentation, reconstruction and scene flow accuracy."}

Recent deep learning based methods depend on learning global geometry from self-reconstruction. However, these methods are still suffering from ineffective learning of local geometry, which significantly limits the discriminability of learned features. To resolve this issue, we propose MAP-VAE to enable the learning of global and local geometry by jointly leveraging global and local self-supervision. To enable effective local self-supervision, we introduce multi-angle analysis for point clouds. In a multi-angle scenario, we first split a point cloud into a front half and a back half from each angle, and then, train MAP-VAE to learn to predict a back half sequence from the corresponding front half sequence. MAP-VAE performs this half-to-half prediction using RNN to simultaneously learn each local geometry and the spatial relationship among them. In addition, MAP-VAE also learns global geometry via self-reconstruction, where we employ a variational constraint to facilitate novel shape generation. The outperforming results in four shape analysis tasks show that MAP-VAE can learn more discriminative global or local features than the state-of-the-art methods."}

Among them the approaches that generate cost volumes based on the plane-sweeping algorithm and then use them for feature matching have shown to be very prominent recently. The plane-sweep volumes are essentially anisotropic in depth and spatial directions, but they are often approximated by isotropic cost volumes in those methods, which could be detrimental. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end deep learning network of P-MVSNet for multi-view stereo based on isotropic and anisotropic 3D convolutions. Our P-MVSNet consists of two core modules: a patch-wise aggregation module learns to aggregate the pixel-wise correspondence information of extracted features to generate a matching confidence volume, from which a hybrid 3D U-Net then infers a depth probability distribution and predicts the depth maps. We perform extensive experiments on the DTU and Tanks & Temples benchmark datasets, and the results show that the proposed P-MVSNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance over many existing methods on multi-view stereo."}

Learning-based prediction methods with explicit motion models often suffer from having to estimate large numbers of motion parameters with artificial regularization. Inspired by the success of sparse motion-based prediction for video compression, we propose a parametric video prediction on a sparse motion field composed of few critical pixels and their motion vectors. The prediction is achieved by gradually refining the estimate of a future frame in iterative, discrete steps. Along the way, the identification of critical pixels and their motion estimation are addressed by two neural networks trained under a reinforcement learning setting. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CaltchPed, UCF101 and CIF datasets in one-step and multi-step prediction tests.

By estimating a dense flow between source and target clothing regions, ClothFlow effectively models the geometric changes and naturally transfers the appearance to synthesize novel images as shown in Figure 1. We achieve this with a three-stage framework: 1) Conditioned on a target pose, we first estimate a person semantic layout to provide richer guidance to the generation process. 2) Built on two feature pyramid networks, a cascaded flow estimation network then accurately estimates the appearance matching between corresponding clothing regions. The resulting dense flow warps the source image to flexibly account for deformations. 3) Finally, a generative network takes the warped clothing regions as inputs and renders the target view. We conduct extensive experiments on the DeepFashion dataset for pose-guided person image generation and on the VITON dataset for the virtual try-on task. Strong qualitative and quantitative results validate the effectiveness of our method."}

Central to our method are multiple and overlapping local adversarial discriminators in a content-style disentangling network for achieving local detail transfer between facial images, with the use of asymmetric loss functions for dramatic makeup styles with high-frequency details. Existing techniques do not demonstrate or fail to transfer high-frequency details in a global adversarial setting, or train a single local discriminator only to ensure image structure consistency and thus work only for relatively simple styles. Unlike others, our proposed local adversarial discriminators can distinguish whether the generated local image details are consistent with the corresponding regions in the given reference image in cross-image style transfer in an unsupervised setting. Incorporating these technical contributions, we achieve not only state-of-the-art results on conventional styles but also novel results involving complex and dramatic styles with high-frequency details covering large areas across multiple facial features.

Here we present a new virtual try-on network, called VTNFP, to synthesize photo-realistic images given the images of a clothed person and a target clothing item. In order to better preserve clothing and body features, VTNFP follows a three-stage design strategy. First, it transforms the target clothing into a warped form compatible with the pose of the given person. Next, it predicts a body segmentation map of the person wearing the target clothing, delineating body parts as well as clothing regions. Finally, the warped clothing, body segmentation map and given person image are fused together for fine-scale image synthesis. A key innovation of VTNFP is the body segmentation map prediction module, which provides critical information to guide image synthesis in regions where body parts and clothing intersects, and is very beneficial for preventing blurry pictures and preserving clothing and body part details. Experiments on a fashion dataset demonstrate that VTNFP generates substantially better results than state-of-the-art methods."}

In contrast to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), PET is costly and involves injecting a radioactive substance into the patient. Motivated by developments in modality transfer in vision, we study the generation of certain types of PET images from MRI data. We derive new flow-based generative models which we show perform well in this small sample size regime (much smaller than dataset sizes available in standard vision tasks). Our formulation, DUAL-GLOW, is based on two invertible networks and a relation network that maps the latent spaces to each other. We discuss how given the prior distribution, learning the conditional distribution of PET given the MRI image reduces to obtaining the conditional distribution between the two latent codes w.r.t. the two image types. We also extend our framework to leverage \"side\" information (or attributes) when available. By controlling the PET generation through \"conditioning\" on age, our model is also able to capture brain FDG-PET (hypometabolism) changes, as a function of age.

Using multiple instance learning (MIL)-based label enrichment, CAMEL splits the image into latticed instances and automatically generates instance-level labels. After label enrichment, the instance-level labels are further assigned to the corresponding pixels, producing the approximate pixel-level labels and making fully supervised training of segmentation models possible. CAMEL achieves comparable performance with the fully supervised approaches in both instance-level classification and pixel-level segmentation on CAMELYON16 and a colorectal adenoma dataset. Moreover, the generality of the automatic labeling methodology may benefit future weakly supervised learning studies for histopathology image analysis."}

Longitudinal image acquisitions are common in various scientific and biomedical studies where often each image sequence sample may also come together with various secondary (fixed or temporally dependent) measurements. The key goal is not only to estimate the parameters of a deep generative model for the given longitudinal data, but also to enable evaluation of how the temporal course of the generated longitudinal samples are influenced as a function of induced changes in the (secondary) temporal measurements (or events). Our proposed formulation incorporates recurrent subnetworks and temporal context gating, which provides a smooth transition in a temporal sequence of generated data that can be easily informed or modulated by secondary temporal conditioning variables. We show that the formulation works well despite the smaller sample sizes common in these applications. Our model is validated on two video datasets and a longitudinal Alzheimer's disease (AD) dataset for both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated samples.

Recently, there are some works trying to speed up the skeleton modeling by designing light-weight modules. However, in addition to the model size, the amount of the data involved in the calculation is also an important factor for the running speed, especially for the skeleton data where most of the joints are redundant or non-informative to identify a specific skeleton.Besides, previous works usually employ one fix-sized model for all the samples regardless of the difficulty of recognition, which wastes computations for easy samples.To address these limitations, a novel approach, called AdaSGN, is proposed in this paper, which can reduce the computational cost of the inference process by adaptively controlling the input number of the joints of the skeleton on-the-fly. Moreover, it can also adaptively select the optimal model size for each sample to achieve a better trade-off between the accuracy and the efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging datasets, namely, NTU-60, NTU-120 and SHREC, to verify the superiority of the proposed approach, where AdaSGN achieves comparable or even higher performance with much lower GFLOPs compared with the baseline method."}

While recent generative noise modeling methods aim to simulate the unknown distribution of real-world noise, several limitations still exist. In a practical scenario, a noise generator should learn to simulate the general and complex noise distribution without using paired noisy and clean images. However, since existing methods are constructed on the unrealistic assumption of real-world noise, they tend to generate implausible patterns and cannot express complicated noise maps. Therefore, we introduce a Clean-to-Noisy image generation framework, namely C2N, to imitate complex real-world noise without using any paired examples. We construct the noise generator in C2N accordingly with each component of real-world noise characteristics to express a wide range of noise accurately. Combined with our C2N, conventional denoising CNNs can be trained to outperform existing unsupervised methods on challenging real-world benchmarks by a large margin."}

Image downsampling is a commonly adopted technique to ensure the latency constraint is met. However, this naive approach greatly restricts an object detector's capability to identify small objects. In this paper, we propose an attentional approach that elastically magnifies certain regions while maintaining a small input canvas. The magnified regions are those that are believed to have a high probability of containing an object, whose signal can come from a dataset-wide prior or frame-level prior computed from recent object predictions. The magnification is implemented by a KDE-based mapping to transform the bounding boxes into warping parameters, which are then fed into an image sampler with anti-cropping regularization. The detector is then fed with the warped image and we apply a differentiable backward mapping to get bounding box outputs in the original space. Our regional magnification allows algorithms to make better use of high-resolution input without incurring the cost of high-resolution processing. On the autonomous driving datasets Argoverse-HD and BDD100K, we show our proposed method boosts the detection AP over standard Faster R-CNN, with and without finetuning. Additionally, building on top of the previous state-of-the-art in streaming detection, our method sets a new record for streaming AP on Argoverse-HD (from 17.8 to 23.0 on a GTX 1080 Ti GPU), suggesting that it has achieved a superior accuracy-latency tradeoff."}

Inspired by the well-known transformer architecture, we propose a relation-aware visual grounding method on 3D point clouds, named as 3DVG-Transformer, to fully utilize the contextual clues for relationenhanced proposal generation and cross-modal proposal disambiguation, which are enabled by a newly designed coordinate-guided contextual aggregation (CCA) module in the object proposal generation stage, and a multiplex attention (MA) module in the cross-modal feature fusion stage. We validate that our 3DVG-Transformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, on two point cloud-based visual grounding datasets, ScanRefer and Nr3D/Sr3D from ReferIt3D, especially for complex scenarios containing multiple objects of the same category."}

When it comes to video sequences, harnessing this force is even more beneficial due to the temporal redundancy. In the context of image and video denoising, many classically-oriented algorithms employ self-similarity, splitting the data into overlapping patches, gathering groups of similar ones and processing these together somehow. With the emergence of convolutional neural networks (CNN), the patch-based framework has been abandoned. Most CNN denoisers operate on the whole image, leveraging non-local relations only implicitly by using a large receptive field. This work proposes a novel approach for leveraging self-similarity in the context of video denoising, while still relying on a regular convolutional architecture. We introduce a concept of patch-craft frames - artificial frames that are similar to the real ones, built by tiling matched patches. Our algorithm augments video sequences with patch-craft frames and feeds them to a CNN. We demonstrate the substantial boost in denoising performance obtained with the proposed approach."}

Current popular researches mainly focus on fully supervised learning which demands expensive and tedious manual point-wise annotation. Weakly supervised learning is an alternative way to avoid this exhausting annotation. However, for large-scale point clouds with few labeled points, the network is difficult to extract discriminative features for unlabeled points, as well as the regularization of topology between labeled and unlabeled points is usually ignored, resulting in incorrect segmentation results. To address this problem, we propose a perturbed self-distillation (PSD) framework. Specifically, inspired by self-supervised learning, we construct the perturbed branch and enforce the predictive consistency among the perturbed branch and original branch. In this way, the graph topology of the whole point cloud can be effectively established by the introduced auxiliary supervision, such that the information propagation between the labeled and unlabeled points will be realized. Besides point-level supervision, we present a well-integrated context-aware module to explicitly regularize the affinity correlation of labeled points. Therefore, the graph topology of the point cloud can be further refined. The experimental results evaluated on three large-scale datasets show the large gain (3.0% on average) against recent weakly supervised methods and comparable results to some fully supervised methods."}

Our method combines a neural network encoder with a tensor train decomposition to learn a low-rank latent encoding, coupled with cross-approximation (CA) to learn the representation through a subset of the original samples. CA is an adaptive sampling algorithm that is native to tensor decompositions and avoids working with the full high-resolution data explicitly. Instead, it actively selects local representative samples that we fetch out-of-core and on demand. The required number of samples grows only logarithmically with the size of the input. Our implicit representation of the tensor in the network enables processing large grids that could not be otherwise tractable in their uncompressed form. The proposed approach is particularly useful for large-scale multidimensional grid data (e.g., 3D tomography), and for tasks that require context over a large receptive field (e.g., predicting the medical condition of entire organs).

However, the performance of existing methods suffers in real life since the user is likely to provide an incomplete description of an image, which often leads to results filled with false positives that fit the incomplete description. In this work, we introduce the partial-query problem and extensively analyze its influence on text-based image retrieval. Previous interactive methods tackle the problem by passively receiving users' feedback to supplement the incomplete query iteratively, which is time-consuming and requires heavy user effort. Instead, we propose a novel retrieval framework that conducts the interactive process in an Ask-and-Confirm fashion, where AI actively searches for discriminative details missing in the current query, and users only need to confirm AI's proposal. Specifically, we propose an object-based interaction to make the interactive retrieval more user-friendly and present a reinforcement-learning-based policy to search for discriminative objects. Furthermore, since fully-supervised training is often infeasible due to the difficulty of obtaining human-machine dialog data, we present a weakly-supervised training strategy that needs no human-annotated dialogs other than a text-image dataset. Experiments show that our framework significantly improves the performance of text-based image retrieval. Code is available at https://github.com/CuthbertCai/Ask-Confirm."}

In this work, we address it for the first time using a single event camera, i.e., an asynchronous vision sensor reacting on brightness changes. Our EventHands approach has characteristics previously not demonstrated with a single RGB or depth camera such as high temporal resolution at low data throughputs and real-time performance at 1000 Hz. Due to the different data modality of event cameras compared to classical cameras, existing methods cannot be directly applied to and re-trained for event streams. We thus design a new neural approach which accepts a new event stream representation suitable for learning, which is trained on newly-generated synthetic event streams and can generalise to real data. Experiments show that EventHands outperforms recent monocular methods using a colour (or depth) camera in terms of accuracy and its ability to capture hand motions of unprecedented speed.

Unlike existing approaches that attempt to learn useful features by maximizing similarity between augmented versions of each input image or by speculatively picking negative samples, we instead also make use of the natural variation that occurs in image collections that are captured using static monitoring cameras. To achieve this, we exploit readily available context data that encodes information such as the spatial and temporal relationships between the input images. We are able to learn representations that are surprisingly effective for downstream supervised classification, by first identifying high probability positive pairs at training time, i.e. those images that are likely to depict the same visual concept. For the critical task of global biodiversity monitoring, this results in image features that can be adapted to challenging visual species classification tasks with limited human supervision. We present results on four different camera trap image collections, across three different families of self-supervised learning methods, and show that careful image selection at training time results in superior performance compared to existing baselines such as conventional self-supervised training and transfer learning."}

Unlike the recently-proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) that was designed for image classification specifically, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT), which overcomes the difficulties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction tasks. PVT has several merits compared to current state of the arts. (1) Different from ViT that typically yields low-resolution outputs and incurs high computational and memory costs, PVT not only can be trained on dense partitions of an image to achieve high output resolution, which is important for dense prediction, but also uses a progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce the computations of large feature maps. (2) PVT inherits the advantages of both CNN and Transformer, making it a unified backbone for various vision tasks without convolutions, where it can be used as a direct replacement for CNN backbones. (3) We validate PVT through extensive experiments, showing that it boosts the performance of many downstream tasks, including object detection, instance and semantic segmentation. For example, with a comparable number of parameters, PVT+RetinaNet achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO dataset, surpassing ResNet50+RetinNet (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute AP. We hope that PVT could serve as an alternative and useful backbone for pixel-level predictions and facilitate future research."}

A common image retrieval practice is to firstly retrieve candidate images via similarity search using global image features and then re-rank the candidates by leveraging their local features. Previous learning-based studies mainly focus on either global or local image representation learning to tackle the retrieval task. In this paper, we abandon the two-stage paradigm and seek to design an effective single-stage solution by integrating local and global information inside images into compact image representations. Specifically, we propose a Deep Orthogonal Local and Global (DOLG) information fusion framework for end-to-end image retrieval. It attentively extracts representative local information with multi-atrous convolutions and self-attention at first. Components orthogonal to the global image representation are then extracted from the local information. At last, the orthogonal components are concatenated with the global representation as a complementary, and then aggregation is performed to generate the final representation. The whole framework is end-to-end differentiable and can be trained with image-level labels. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our solution and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art image retrieval performances on Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets."}

Prevalent methods typically assign a router for each convolutional block and sequentially make block-by-block executing decisions, without considering the relations during the dynamic inference. In this paper, we model the relations for dynamic inference from two aspects: the routers and the samples. We design a novel type of router called the relational router to model the relations among routers for a given sample. In principle, the current relational router aggregates the contextual features of preceding routers by graph convolution and propagates its router features to subsequent ones, making the executing decision for the current block in a long-range manner. Furthermore, we model the relation between samples by introducing a Sample Relation Module (SRM), encouraging correlated samples to go along correlated executing paths. As a whole, we call our method the Relational Dynamic Inference Network (RDI-Net).

However, the ranking correlation between the architectures' predicted accuracy and their actual capability is incorrect, which causes the existing NAS methods' dilemma. We attribute this ranking correlation problem to the supernet training consistency shift, including feature shift and parameter shift. Feature shift is identified as dynamic input distributions of a hidden layer due to random path sampling. The input distribution dynamic affects the loss descent and finally affects architecture ranking. Parameter shift is identified as contradictory parameter updates for a shared layer lay in different paths in different training steps. The rapidly-changing parameter could not preserve architecture ranking. We address these two shifts simultaneously using a nontrivial supernet-\\Pi model, called \\Pi-NAS. Specifically, we employ a supernet-\\Pi model that contains cross-path learning to reduce the feature consistency shift between different paths. Meanwhile, we adopt a novel nontrivial mean teacher containing negative samples to overcome parameter shift and model collision. Furthermore, our \\Pi-NAS runs in an unsupervised manner, which can search for more transferable architectures. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and a wide range of downstream tasks (e.g., COCO 2017, ADE20K, and Cityscapes) demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our \\Pi-NAS compared to supervised NAS.

Most SGGs silently exploit datasets' bias on relationships' context, i.e. its subject and object, to improve recall and neglect spatial and visual evidence, e.g. having seen a glut of data for person wearing shirt, they are overconfident that every person is wearing every shirt. Such imprecise predictions are mainly ascribed to the lack of negative examples for most relationships, fact that obstructs models from meaningfully learning predicates, even those which have ample positive examples. We first present an in-depth investigation of the context bias issue to showcase that all examined state-of-the-art SGGs share the above vulnerabilities. In response, we propose a semi-supervised scheme that forces predicted triplets to be grounded consistently back to the image, in a closed-loop manner. The developed spatial common sense can be then distilled to a student SGG and substantially enhance its spatial reasoning ability. This Grounding Consistency Distillation (GCD) approach is model-agnostic and profits from the superfluous unlabeled samples to retain the valuable context information and avert memorization of annotations. Furthermore, we ascertain that current metrics disregard unlabeled samples, rendering themselves incapable of reflecting context bias, then we mine and incorporate during evaluation hard-negatives to reformulate precision as a reliable metric. Extensive experimental comparisons exhibit large quantitative - up to 70% relative precision boost on VG200 dataset - and qualitative improvements to prove the significance of our GCD method and our metrics towards refocusing graph generation as a core aspect of scene understanding.

Existing models focus on single-frame segmentation, which cannot achieve satisfactory segmentation accuracy and offer unstably flicker among frames. In this paper, we propose a light-weight semantic segmentation framework for large-scale point cloud series, called TempNet, which can improve both the accuracy and the stability of existing semantic segmentation models by combining a novel frame aggregation scheme. To be computational cost efficient, feature extraction and aggregation are only conducted on a small portion of key frames via a temporal feature aggregation (TFA) network using an attentional pooling mechanism, and such enhanced features are propagated to the intermediate non-key frames. To avoid information loss from non-key frames, a partial feature update (PFU) network is designed to partially update the propagated features with the local features extracted on a non-key frame if a large disparity between the two is quickly assessed. As a result, consistent and information-rich features can be obtained for each frame. We implement TempNet on five state-of-the-art (SOTA) point cloud segmentation models and conduct extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset. Results demonstrate that TempNet outperforms SOTA competitors by wide margins with little extra computational cost."}

Inspired by the neurobiology research about the independence of remembering and forgetting, we propose to re-parameterize a CNN into the remembering parts and forgetting parts, where the former learn to maintain the performance and the latter learn to prune. Via training with regular SGD on the former but a novel update rule with penalty gradients on the latter, we realize structured sparsity. Then we equivalently merge the remembering and forgetting parts into the original architecture with narrower layers. In this sense, ResRep can be viewed as a successful application of Structural Re-parameterization. Such a methodology distinguishes ResRep from the traditional learning-based pruning paradigm that applies a penalty on parameters to produce sparsity, which may suppress the parameters essential for the remembering. ResRep slims down a standard ResNet-50 with 76.15% accuracy on ImageNet to a narrower one with only 45% FLOPs and no accuracy drop, which is the first to achieve lossless pruning with such a high compression ratio.

Towards the latter, we utilize the multi-head framework to extract reliable target pseudo-labels for self-training.

Its performance however degrades notably in indoor environments because of the lack of textures. Without rich textures, the photometric consistency is too weak to train a good depth network. Inspired by the early works on indoor modeling, we leverage the structural regularities exhibited in indoor scenes, to train a better depth network. Specifically, we adopt two extra supervisory signals for self-supervised training: 1) the Manhattan normal constraint and 2) the co-planar constraint. The Manhattan normal constraint enforces the major surfaces (the floor, ceiling, and walls) to be aligned with dominant directions. The co-planar constraint states that the 3D points be well fitted by a plane if they are located within the same planar region. To generate the supervisory signals, we adopt two components to classify the major surface normal into dominant directions and detect the planar regions on the fly during training. As the predicted depth becomes more accurate after more training epochs, the supervisory signals also improve and in turn feedback to obtain a better depth model. Through extensive experiments on indoor benchmark datasets, the results show that our network outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

However, unlike point-to-plane variants of iterative closest point (ICP) which incorporate local surface geometric information such as surface normals, most probabilistic methods (e.g., coherent point drift (CPD)) ignore such information and build Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) with isotropic Gaussian covariances. This results in sphere-like GMM components which only penalize the point-to-point distance between the two point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel method called CPD with Local Surface Geometry (LSG-CPD) for rigid point cloud registration. Our method adaptively adds different levels of point-to-plane penalization on top of the point-to-point penalization based on the flatness of the local surface. This results in GMM components with anisotropic covariances. We formulate point cloud registration as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and solve it with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E step, we demonstrate that the computation can be recast into simple matrix manipulations and efficiently computed on a GPU. In the M step, we perform an unconstrained optimization on a matrix Lie group to efficiently update the rigid transformation of the registration. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness on various datasets captured with range scanners, RGBD cameras, and LiDARs.

Most existing methods take the words in the instructions and the discrete views of each panorama as the minimal unit of encoding. However, this requires a model to match different nouns (e.g., TV, table) against the same input view feature.

Our sequential BERT also enables the visual-textual clues to be interpreted in light of the temporal context, which is crucial to multi-round VLN tasks. Additionally, we enable the model to identify the relative direction (e.g., left/right/front/back) of each navigable location and the room type (e.g., bedroom, kitchen) of its current and final navigation goal, as such information is widely mentioned in instructions implying the desired next and final locations.

Our novel transformer-based prediction pipeline can focus on image regions relevant to the task, supports self-supervised regimes, and ensures that solutions are consistent with human anthropometry. We show state-of-the-art results on Human3.6M and 3DPW, for both the fully-supervised and the self-supervised models, for the task of inferring 3d human shape, joint positions, and global translation. Moreover, we observe very solid 3d reconstruction performance for difficult human poses collected in the wild."}

However, RNN suffers from non-parallelism and gradient vanishing, hence it is hard to be optimized. In this paper, we propose a new encoder-decoder framework based on Transformers, named OadTR, to tackle these problems. The encoder attached with a task token aims to capture the relationships and global interactions between historical observations. The decoder extracts auxiliary information by aggregating anticipated future clip representations. Therefore, OadTR can recognize current actions by encoding historical information and predicting future context simultaneously. We extensively evaluate the proposed OadTR on three challenging datasets: HDD, TVSeries, and THUMOS14. The experimental results show that OadTR achieves higher training and inference speeds than current RNN based approaches, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both mAP and mcAP.

To achieve complex tasks in volatile situations, the human can deeply understand the environment, quickly perceive events happening around, and continuously track objects' state changes, which are still challenging for current AI systems. To equip AI system with the ability to understand dynamic ENVironments, we build a video Question Answering dataset named Env-QA. Env-QA contains 23K egocentric videos, where each video is composed of a series of events about exploring and interacting in the environment. It also provides 85K questions to evaluate the ability of understanding the composition, layout, and state changes of the environment presented by the events in videos. Moreover, we propose a video QA model, Temporal Segmentation and Event Attention network (TSEA), which introduces event-level video representation and corresponding attention mechanisms to better extract environment information and answer questions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and show the formidable challenges of Env-QA in terms of long-term state tracking, multi-event temporal reasoning and event counting, etc."}

In this paper, we propose a new computationally efficient LiDAR based panoptic segmentation framework, called GP-S3Net. GP-S3Net is a proposal-free approach in which no object proposals are needed to identify the objects in contrast to conventional two-stage panoptic systems, where a detection network is incorporated for capturing instance information.  Our new design consists of a novel instance-level network to process the semantic results by constructing a graph convolutional network to identify objects (foreground), which later on are fused with the background classes. Through the fine-grained clusters of the foreground objects from the semantic segmentation backbone, over-segmentation priors are generated and subsequently processed by 3D sparse convolution to embed each cluster. Each cluster is treated as a node in the graph and its corresponding embedding is used as its node feature. Then a GCNN predicts whether edges exist between each cluster pair. We utilize the instance label to generate ground truth edge labels for each constructed graph in order to supervise the learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GP-S3Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches, by a significant margin across available datasets such as, nuScenes and SemanticPOSS, ranking first on the competitive public SemanticKITTI leaderboard upon publication."}

What are the effects on other parts of an object if you could locally push it? There will be distinctive movement, despite evident variations caused by the stochastic nature of our world. These outcomes are governed by the characteristic kinematics of objects that dictate their overall motion caused by a local interaction. Conversely, the movement of an object provides crucial information about its underlying distinctive kinematics and the interdependencies between its parts. This two-way relation motivates learning a bijective mapping between object kinematics and plausible future image sequences. Therefore, we propose iPOKE -- invertible Prediction of Object Kinematics -- that, conditioned on an initial frame and a local poke, allows to sample object kinematics and establishes a one-to-one correspondence to the corresponding plausible videos, thereby providing a controlled stochastic video synthesis. In contrast to previous works, we do not generate arbitrary realistic videos, but provide efficient control of movements, while still capturing the stochastic nature of our environment and the diversity of plausible outcomes it entails. Moreover, our approach can transfer kinematics onto novel object instances and is not confined to particular object classes. Our project page is available at https://bit.ly/3dJN4Lf."}

The conventional feature imitation paradigm introduces imitation masks to focus on informative foreground areas while excluding the background noises. However, we find that those methods fail to fully utilize the semantic information in all feature pyramid levels, which leads to inefficiency for knowledge distillation between FPN-based detectors. To this end, we propose a novel semantic-guided feature imitation technique, which automatically performs soft matching between feature pairs across all pyramid levels to provide the optimal guidance to the student. To push the envelop even further, we introduce contrastive distillation to effectively capture the information encoded in the relationship between different feature regions. Finally, we propose a generalized detection KD pipeline, which is capable of distilling both homogeneous and heterogeneous detector pairs. Our method consistently outperforms the existing detection KD techniques, and works when (1) components in the framework are used separately and in conjunction; (2) for both homogeneous and heterogenous student-teacher pairs and (3) on multiple detection benchmarks. With a powerful X101-FasterRCNN-Instaboost detector as the teacher, R50-FasterRCNN reaches 44.0% AP, R50-RetinaNet reaches 43.3% AP and R50-FCOS reaches 43.1% AP on COCO dataset."}

While being able to bring reliable robustness, adversarial training (AT) methods in general favor high capacity models, i.e., the larger the model the better the robustness. This tends to limit their effectiveness on small models, which are more preferable in scenarios where storage or computing resources are very limited (e.g., mobile devices). In this paper, we leverage the concept of knowledge distillation to improve the robustness of small models by distilling from adversarially trained large models. We first revisit several state-of-the-art AT methods from a distillation perspective and identify one common technique that can lead to improved robustness: the use of robust soft labels -- predictions of a robust model. Following this observation, we propose a novel adversarial robustness distillation method called Robust Soft Label Adversarial Distillation (RSLAD) to train robust small student models. RSLAD fully exploits the robust soft labels produced by a robust (adversarially-trained) large teacher model to guide the student's learning on both natural and adversarial examples in all loss terms. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our RSLAD approach over existing adversarial training and distillation methods in improving the robustness of small models against state-of-the-art attacks including the AutoAttack. We also provide a set of understandings on our RSLAD and the importance of robust soft labels for adversarial robustness distillation. Code: https://github.com/zibojia/RSLAD."}

We show that current 3D HPE methods suffer a lack of viewpoint equivariance, namely they tend to fail or perform poorly when dealing with viewpoints unseen at training time. Deep learning methods often rely on either scale-invariant, translation-invariant, or rotation-invariant operations, such as max-pooling. However, the adoption of such procedures does not necessarily improve viewpoint generalization, rather leading to more data-dependent methods. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel capsule autoencoder network with fast Variational Bayes capsule routing, named DECA. By modeling each joint as a capsule entity, combined with the routing algorithm, our approach can preserve the joints' hierarchical and geometrical structure in the feature space, independently from the viewpoint. By achieving viewpoint equivariance, we drastically reduce the network data dependency at training time, resulting in an improved ability to generalize for unseen viewpoints. In the experimental validation, we outperform other methods on depth images from both seen and unseen viewpoints, both top-view, and front-view. In the RGB domain, the same network gives state-of-the-art results on the challenging viewpoint transfer task, also establishing a new framework for top-view HPE."}

Some of the most efficient algorithms for finding global minimum cuts are randomized algorithms based on Karger's groundbreaking contraction algorithm. Here, we study whether Karger's algorithm can be successfully generalized to other cut problems. We first prove that a wide class of natural generalizations of Karger's algorithm cannot efficiently solve the s-t-mincut or the normalized cut problem to optimality. However, we then present a simple new algorithm for seeded segmentation / graph-based semi-supervised learning that is closely based on Karger's original algorithm, showing that for these problems, extensions of Karger's algorithm can be useful. The new algorithm has linear asymptotic runtime and yields a potential that can be interpreted as the posterior probability of a sample belonging to a given seed / class. We clarify its relation to the random walker algorithm / harmonic energy minimization in terms of distributions over spanning forests. On classical problems from seeded image segmentation and graph-based semi-supervised learning on image data, the method performs at least as well as the random walker / harmonic energy minimization / Gaussian processes."}

Being bound to local convolutions, CNNs need explicit 3D biases to model geometric transformations. In contrast, we demonstrate that a transformer-based model can synthesize entirely novel views without any hand-engineered 3D biases. This is achieved by (i) a global attention mechanism for implicitly learning long-range 3D correspondences between source and target views, and (ii) a probabilistic formulation necessary to capture the ambiguity inherent in predicting novel views from a single image, thereby overcoming the limitations of previous approaches that are restricted to relatively small viewpoint changes. We evaluate various ways to integrate 3D priors into a transformer architecture. However, our experiments show that no such geometric priors are required and that the transformer is capable of implicitly learning 3D relationships between images. Furthermore, this approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of visual quality while covering the full distribution of possible realizations."}

Existing approaches to audio-driven facial animation exhibit uncanny or static upper face animation, fail to produce accurate and plausible co-articulation or rely on person-specific models that limit their scalability. To improve upon existing models, we propose a generic audio-driven facial animation approach that achieves highly realistic motion synthesis results for the entire face. At the core of our approach is a categorical latent space for facial animation that disentangles audio-correlated and audio-uncorrelated information based on a novel cross-modality loss. Our approach ensures highly accurate lip motion, while also synthesizing plausible animation of the parts of the face that are uncorrelated to the audio signal, such as eye blinks and eye brow motion. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms several baselines and obtains state-of-the-art quality both qualitatively and quantitatively.

While reinforcement learning (RL) based agents can generate a stroke sequence step by step for this task, it is not easy to train a stable RL agent. On the other hand, stroke optimization methods search for a set of stroke parameters iteratively in a large search space; such low efficiency significantly limits their prevalence and practicality. Different from previous methods, in this paper, we formulate the task as a set prediction problem and propose a novel Transformer-based framework, dubbed Paint Transformer, to predict the parameters of a stroke set with a feed forward network. This way, our model can generate a set of strokes in parallel and obtain the final painting of size 512x512 in near real time. More importantly, since there is no dataset available for training the Paint Transformer, we devise a self-training pipeline such that it can be trained without any off-the-shelf dataset while still achieving excellent generalization capability. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better painting performance than previous ones with cheaper training and inference costs. Codes and models will be available."}

Unsupervised pre-training methods have been recently designed for object detection, but they are usually deficient in image classification, or the opposite. Unlike them, DetCo transfers well on downstream instance-level dense prediction tasks, while maintaining competitive image-level classification accuracy. The advantages are derived from (1) multi-level supervision to intermediate representations, (2) contrastive learning between global image and local patches. These two designs facilitate discriminative and consistent global and local representation at each level of feature pyramid, improving detection and classification, simultaneously. Extensive experiments on VOC, COCO, Cityscapes, and ImageNet demonstrate that DetCo not only outperforms recent methods on a series of 2D and 3D instance-level detection tasks, but also competitive on image classification. For example, on ImageNet classification, DetCo is 6.9% and 5.0% top-1 accuracy better than InsLoc and DenseCL, which are two contemporary works designed for object detection. Moreover, on COCO detection, DetCo is 6.9 AP better than SwAV with Mask R-CNN C4.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first embodied reference dataset that allows us to study referring expressions in daily physical scenes to understand referential behavior, human communication, and human-robot interaction. We further devise two benchmarks for image-based and video-based embodied reference understanding. Comprehensive baselines and extensive experiments provide the very first result of machine perception on how the referring expressions and gestures affect the embodied reference understanding.

Research has primarily focused on the incremental classification setting, where new tasks/classes are added at discrete time intervals. Such an \"offline\" setting does not evaluate the ability of agents to learn effectively and efficiently, since an agent can perform multiple learning epochs without any time limitation when a task is added. We argue that \"online\" continual learning, where data is a single continuous stream without task boundaries, enables evaluating both information retention and online learning efficacy. In online continual learning, each incoming small batch of data is first used for testing and then added to the training set, making the problem truly online. Trained models are later evaluated on historical data to assess information retention. We introduce a new benchmark for online continual visual learning that exhibits large scale and natural distribution shifts. Through a large-scale analysis, we identify critical and previously unobserved phenomena of gradient-based optimization in continual learning, and propose effective strategies for improving gradient-based online continual learning with real data.

We also propose Social Fabric: an encoding that represents a pair of object tubelets as a composition of interaction primitives. These primitives are learned over all relations, resulting in a compact representation able to localize and classify relations from the pool of co-occurring object tubelets across all timespans in a video. The encoding enables our two-stage network. In the first stage, we train Social Fabric to suggest proposals that are likely interacting. We use the Social Fabric in the second stage to simultaneously fine-tune and predict predicate labels for the tubelets.

However, more extensive applications of such IoT systems are still limited by two challenges. First, some applications, especially medicine- and wearable-related ones, impose stringent requirements on the camera form factor. Second, powerful CNNs often require considerable storage and energy cost, whereas IoT devices often suffer from limited resources. PhlatCam, with its form factor potentially reduced by orders of magnitude, has emerged as a promising solution to the first aforementioned challenge, while the second one remains a bottleneck. Existing compression techniques, which can potentially tackle the second challenge, are far from realizing the full potential in storage and energy reduction, because they mostly focus on the CNN algorithm itself. To this end, this work proposes SACoD, a Sensor Algorithm Co-Design framework to develop more efficient CNN-powered PhlatCam. In particular, the mask coded in the PhlatCam sensor and the backend CNN model are jointly optimized in terms of both model parameters and architectures via differential neural architecture search. Extensive experiments including both simulation and physical measurement on manufactured masks show that the proposed SACoD framework achieves aggressive model compression and energy savings while maintaining or even boosting the task accuracy, when benchmarking over two state-of-the-art (SOTA) designs with six datasets across four different vision tasks including classification, segmentation, image translation, and face recognition.

Conventional CNNs/RNNs assume one-to-one mapping, and thus tend to predict the average of all possible target motions, resulting in plain/boring motions during inference. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) that explicitly models one-to-many audio-to-motion mapping by splitting the cross-modal latent code into shared code and motion-specific code. The shared code mainly models the strong correlation between audio and motion (such as the synchronized audio and motion beats), while the motion-specific code captures diverse motion information independent of the audio. However, splitting the latent code into two parts poses training difficulties for the VAE model. A mapping network facilitating random sampling along with other techniques including relaxed motion loss, bicycle constraint, and diversity loss are designed to better train the VAE. Experiments on both 3D and 2D motion datasets verify that our method generates more realistic and diverse motions than state-of-the-art methods, quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can be readily used to generate motion sequences with user-specified motion clips on the timeline.

However, previous methods usually suffered from discrete nature of point cloud and unstructured prediction of points in local regions, which makes it hard to reveal fine local geometric details on the complete shape. To resolve this issue, we propose SnowflakeNet with Snowflake Point Deconvolution (SPD) to generate the complete point clouds. The SnowflakeNet models the generation of complete point clouds as the snowflake-like growth of points in 3D space, where the child points are progressively generated by splitting their parent points after each SPD. Our insight of revealing detailed geometry is to introduce skip-transformer in SPD to learn point splitting patterns which can fit local regions the best. Skip-transformer leverages attention mechanism to summarize the splitting patterns used in the previous SPD layer to produce the splitting in the current SPD layer. The locally compact and structured point cloud generated by SPD is able to precisely capture the structure characteristic of 3D shape in local patches, which enables the network to predict highly detailed geometries, such as smooth regions, sharp edges and corners.

In practice, a one-shot supernet is trained to serve as an evaluator. A faithful ranking certainly leads to more accurate searching results. However, current methods are prone to making misjudgments. In this paper, we prove that their biased evaluation is due to inherent unfairness in the supernet training. In view of this, we propose two levels of constraints: expectation fairness and strict fairness. Particularly, strict fairness ensures equal optimization opportunities for all choice blocks throughout the training, which neither overestimates nor underestimates their capacity. We demonstrate that this is crucial for improving the confidence of models' ranking. Incorporating the one-shot supernet trained under the proposed fairness constraints with a multi-objective evolutionary search algorithm, we obtain various state-of-the-art models, e.g., FairNAS-A attains 77.5% top-1 validation accuracy on ImageNet."}

We efficiently train the policy network jointly with the recognition model using standard back-propagation.

However, for sign languages, this implies breaking motion into its constituent motion primitives. Avatar based Sign Language Production (SLP) has traditionally done just this, building up animation from sequences of hand motions, shapes and facial expressions. However, more recent deep learning based solutions to SLP have tackled the problem using a single network that estimates the full skeletal structure.  We propose splitting the SLP task into two distinct jointly-trained sub-tasks. The first translation sub-task translates from spoken language to a latent sign language representation, with gloss supervision. Subsequently, the animation sub-task aims to produce expressive sign language sequences that closely resemble the learnt spatio-temporal representation. Using a progressive transformer for the translation sub-task, we propose a novel Mixture of Motion Primitives (MoMP) architecture for sign language animation. A set of distinct motion primitives are learnt during training, that can be temporally combined at inference to animate continuous sign language sequences. We evaluate on the challenging RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T(PHOENIX14T) dataset, presenting extensive ablation studies and showing that MoMP outperforms baselines in user evaluations. We achieve state-of-the-art back translation performance with an 11% improvement over competing results. Importantly, and for the first time, we showcase stronger performance for a full translation pipeline going from spoken language to sign, than from gloss to sign."}

These directions enable controllable image generation and support a wide range of semantic editing operations, such as zoom or rotation. The discovery of such directions is often done in a supervised or semi-supervised manner and requires manual annotations which limits their use in practice. In comparison, unsupervised discovery allows finding subtle directions that are difficult to detect a priori. In this work, we propose a contrastive learning-based approach to discover semantic directions in the latent space of pre-trained GANs in a self-supervised manner. Our approach finds semantically meaningful dimensions compatible with state-of-the-art methods."}

Existing learning-based methods often require vast computation cost to achieve excellent performance, which limits their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel Recurrent Forward Network (RFNet), which is composed of three modules: Recurrent Feature Extraction (RFE), Forward Dense Completion (FDC) and Raw Shape Protection (RSP). The RFE extracts multiple global features from the incomplete point clouds for different recurrent levels, and the FDC generates point clouds in a coarse-to-fine pipeline. The RSP introduces details from the original incomplete models to refine the completion results. Besides, we propose a Sampling Chamfer Distance to better capture the shapes of models and a new Balanced Expansion Constraint to restrict the expansion distances from coarse to fine. According to the experiments on ShapeNet and KITTI, our network can achieve the state-of-the-art with lower memory cost and faster convergence."}

Current methods regard the user's history as holistic information to predict the user's preference but negating the inherent diversity of the user's interests, resulting in vague preference representation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient preference reasoning framework (PR-Net) to explicitly take the diverse interests into account for frame-level highlight prediction. Specifically, distinct user-specific preferences for each input query frame are produced, presented as the similarity weighted sum of history highlights to the corresponding query frame. Next, distinct comprehensive preferences are formed by the user-specific preferences and a learnable generic preference for more overall highlight measurement. Lastly, the degree of highlight and non-highlight for each query frame is calculated as semantic similarity to its comprehensive and non-highlight preferences, respectively. Besides, to alleviate the ambiguity due to the incomplete annotation, a new bi-directional contrastive loss is proposed to ensure a compact and differentiable metric space. In this way, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a relative improvement of 12% in mean accuracy precision."}

Therefore, recovering the complete point clouds from partial ones becomes an indispensable task in many practical applications. In this paper, we present a new method that reformulates point cloud completion as a set-to-set translation problem and design a new model, called PoinTr that adopts a transformer encoder-decoder architecture for point cloud completion. By representing the point cloud as a set of unordered groups of points with position embeddings, we convert the point cloud to a sequence of point proxies and employ the transformers for point cloud generation. To facilitate transformers to better leverage the inductive bias about 3D geometric structures of point clouds, we further devise a geometry-aware block that models the local geometric relationships explicitly. The migration of transformers enables our model to better learn structural knowledge and preserve detailed information for point cloud completion. Furthermore, we propose two more challenging benchmarks with more diverse incomplete point clouds that can better reflect the real-world scenarios to promote future research. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on both the new benchmarks and the existing ones."}

At the same time, existing racing simulation frameworks struggle in capturing realism, with respect to visual rendering, vehicular dynamics, and task objectives, inhibiting the transfer of learning agents to real-world contexts. We introduce a new environment, where agents Learn-to-Race (L2R) in simulated competition-style racing, using multimodal information|from virtual cameras to a comprehensive array of inertial measurement sensors. Our environment, which includes a simulator and an interfacing training framework, accurately models vehicle dynamics and racing conditions. In this paper, we release the Arrival simulator for autonomous racing. Next, we propose the L2R task with challenging metrics, inspired by learning-to-drive challenges, Formula-style racing, and multimodal trajectory prediction for autonomous driving. Additionally, we provide the L2R framework suite, facilitating simulated racing on high-precision models of real-world tracks.

Current deep-learning-based sign language recognition (SLR) methods may suffer insufficient interpretability and overfitting due to limited sign data sources. In this paper, we introduce the first self-supervised pre-trainable SignBERT with incorporated hand prior for SLR. SignBERT views the hand pose as a visual token, which is derived from an off-the-shelf pose extractor. The visual tokens are then embedded with gesture state, temporal and hand chirality information. To take full advantage of available sign data sources, SignBERT first performs self-supervised pre-training by masking and reconstructing visual tokens. Jointly with several mask modeling strategies, we attempt to incorporate hand prior in a model-aware method to better model hierarchical context over the hand sequence. Then with the prediction head added, SignBERT is fine-tuned to perform the downstream SLR task. To validate the effectiveness of our method on SLR, we perform extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets, i.e., NMFs-CSL, SLR500, MSASL and WLASL. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of both self-supervised learning and imported hand prior. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks with a notable gain."}

Recent studies concentrate on deep neural architectures for depth estimation by using conventional depth fusion method or direct 3D reconstruction network by regressing Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF). In this paper, we advocate that replicating the traditional two stages framework with deep neural networks improves both the interpretability and the accuracy of the results. As mentioned, our network operates in two steps: 1) the local computation of the local depth maps with a deep MVS technique, and, 2) the depth maps and images' features fusion to build a single TSDF volume. In order to improve the matching performance between images acquired from very different viewpoints (e.g., large-baseline and rotations), we introduce a rotation-invariant 3D convolution kernel called PosedConv. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is underlined via a large series of experiments conducted on the ScanNet dataset where our approach compares favorably against both traditional and deep learning techniques."}

Given a colored point cloud and a 360 panorama image of a scene, our objective is to recover the camera pose at which the panorama image is taken. Our pipeline works in an off-the-shelf manner with a single image given as a query and does not require any training of neural networks or collecting ground-truth poses of images. Instead, we match each point cloud color to the holistic view of the panorama image with gradient-descent optimization to find the camera pose. Our loss function, called sampling loss, is point cloud-centric, evaluated at the projected location of every point in the point cloud. In contrast, conventional photometric loss is image-centric, comparing colors at each pixel location. With a simple change in the compared entities, sampling loss effectively overcomes the severe visual distortion of omnidirectional images, and enjoys the global context of the 360 view to handle challenging scenarios for visual localization. PICCOLO outperforms existing omnidirectional localization algorithms in both accuracy and stability when evaluated in various environments."}

There have been plenty of works concentrated on learning with in-distribution (IND) noisy labels in the last decade, i.e., some training samples are assigned incorrect labels that do not correspond to their true classes. Nonetheless, in real application scenarios, it is necessary to consider the influence of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, i.e., samples that do not belong to any known classes, which has not been sufficiently explored yet. To remedy this, we study a new problem setup, namely Learning with Open-world Noisy Data (LOND). The goal of LOND is to simultaneously learn a classifier and an OOD detector from datasets with mixed IND and OOD noise. In this paper, we propose a new graph-based framework, namely Noisy Graph Cleaning (NGC), which collects clean samples by leveraging geometric structure of data and model predictive confidence. Without any additional training effort, NGC can detect and reject the OOD samples based on the learned class prototypes directly in testing phase. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmarks with different types of noise and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our method against state of the arts."}

Such approaches face different challenges and can lead to biased embeddings in the former case, and (i) harder optimization (ii) slower training speed (iii) higher model complexity in the latter case. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that looks for optimal hard negatives (LoOp) in the embedding space, taking full advantage of each tuple by calculating the minimum distance between a pair of positives and a pair of negatives. Unlike mining-based methods, our approach considers the entire space between pairs of embeddings to calculate the optimal hard negatives. Extensive experiments combining our approach and representative metric learning losses reveal a significant boost in performance on three benchmark datasets."}

An effective attention-aware module is designed to obtain the fine-grained geometry details from multi-view images, where high-fidelity results can be generated. In addition to the spatial attention method, for video inputs, we further propose a novel temporal fusion method to alleviate the noise and temporal inconsistencies for moving character reconstruction.

The proposed AIST++ dataset contains 1.1M frames of 3D dance motion in 1408 sequences, covering 10 dance genres with multi-view videos with known camera poses---the largest dataset of this kind to our knowledge. We show that naively applying sequence models such as transformers to this dataset for the task of music conditioned 3D motion generation does not produce satisfactory 3D motion that is well correlated with the input music. We overcome these shortcomings by introducing key changes in its architecture design and supervision: FACT model involves a deep cross-modal transformer block with full-attention that is trained to predict N future motions. We empirically show that these changes are key factors in generating long sequences of realistic dance motion that are well-attuned to the input music.

Upsampling sparse, noisy and non-uniform point clouds for a denser and more regular approximation of target objects is a desirable but challenging task. Most existing methods duplicate point features for upsampling, constraining the upsampling scales at a fixed rate. In this work, the arbitrary point clouds upsampling rates are achieved via edge-vector based affine combinations, and a novel design of Edge-Vector based Approximation for Flexible-scale Point clouds Upsampling (PU-EVA) is proposed. The edge-vector based approximation encodes neighboring connectivity via affine combinations based on edge vectors, and restricts the approximation error within a second-order term of Taylor's Expansion. Moreover, the EVA upsampling decouples the upsampling scales with network architecture, achieving the arbitrary upsampling rates in one-time training. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PU-EVA outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of proximity-to-surface, distribution uniformity, and geometric details preservation."}

Our approach uses a differentiable spherical projection layer to capture and represent the explicit zero isosurface of an implicit 3D generator as functions defined on the unit sphere. By processing the spherical representation of 3D object surfaces with a spherical CNN in an adversarial setting, our generator can better learn the statistics of natural shape surfaces.

Although convolution neural network (CNN)-based methods have achieved great success, they only process one local neighborhood at a time and suffer from information loss on details caused by convolution and downsampling operators pooling and strided convolution).To overcome these limitations, we propose a pure transformer-based object ReID framework named TransReID. Specifically, we first encode an image as a sequence of patches and build a transformer-based strong baseline with a few critical improvements, which achieves competitive results on several ReID benchmarks with CNN-based methods. To further enhance the robust feature learning in the context of transformers, two novel modules are carefully designed. (i) The jigsaw patch module (JPM) is proposed to rearrange the patch embeddings via shift and patch shuffle operations which generates robust features with improved discrimination ability and more diversified coverage. (ii) The side information embeddings (SIE) is introduced to mitigate feature bias towards camera/view variations by plugging in learnable embeddings to incorporate these non-visual clues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt a pure transformer for ReID research.

BN is observed to increase the model accuracy while at the cost of adversarial robustness. There is an increasing interest in the ML community to understand the impact of BN on DNNs, especially related to the model robustness. This work attempts to understand the impact of BN on DNNs from a non-robust feature perspective. Straightforwardly, the improved accuracy can be attributed to the better utilization of useful features. It remains unclear whether BN mainly favors learning robust features (RFs) or non-robust features (NRFs). Our work presents empirical evidence that supports that BN shifts a model towards being more dependent on NRFs. To facilitate the analysis of such a feature robustness shift, we propose a framework for disentangling robust usefulness into robustness and usefulness. Extensive analysis under the proposed framework yields valuable insight on the DNN behavior regarding robustness, e.g. DNNs first mainly learn RFs and then NRFs. The insight that RFs transfer better than NRFs, further inspires simple techniques to strengthen transfer-based black-box attacks."}

The raw output of these systems are noisy and incomplete 3D points or short tracklets of points. To be useful, one must associate these points with corresponding markers on the captured subject; i.e. \"labelling\". Given these labels, one can then \"solve\" for the 3D skeleton or body surface mesh. Commercial auto-labeling tools require a specific calibration procedure at capture time, which is not possible for archival data. Here we train a novel neural network called SOMA, which takes raw mocap point clouds with varying numbers of points, labels them at scale without any calibration data, independent of the capture technology, and requiring only minimal human intervention. Our key insight is that, while labeling point clouds is highly ambiguous, the 3D body provides strong constraints on the solution that can be exploited by a learning-based method. To enable learning, we generate massive training sets of simulated noisy and ground truth mocap markers animated by 3D bodies from AMASS. SOMA exploits an architecture with stacked self-attention elements to learn the spatial structure of the 3D body and an optimal transport layer to constrain the assignment (labeling) problem while rejecting outliers. We extensively evaluate SOMA both quantitatively and qualitatively. SOMA is more accurate and robust than existing state of the art research methods and can be applied where commercial systems cannot. We automatically label over 8 hours of archival mocap data across 4 different datasets captured using various technologies and output SMPL-X body models.

Recently, transformers without CNN-based backbones are found to achieve impressive performance for image recognition. However, the transformer is designed for NLP tasks and thus could be sub-optimal when directly used for image recognition. In order to improve the visual representation ability for transformers, we propose a new search space and searching algorithm. Specifically, we introduce a locality module that models the local correlations in images explicitly with fewer computational cost. With the locality module, our search space is defined to let the search algorithm freely trade off between global and local information as well as optimizing the low-level design choice in each module. To tackle the problem caused by huge search space, a hierarchical neural architecture search method is proposed to search the optimal vision transformer from two levels separately with the evolutionary algorithm. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method can find more discriminative and efficient transformer variants than the ResNet family (e.g., ResNet101) and the baseline ViT for image classification."}

Recently, the principle has also been used to learn cross-modal embeddings for video and text, yet without exploiting its full potential. In particular, previous losses do not take the intra-modality similarities into account, which leads to inefficient embeddings, as the same content is mapped to multiple points in the embedding space. With CrossCLR, we present a contrastive loss that fixes this issue. Moreover, we define sets of highly related samples in terms of their input embeddings and exclude them from the negative samples to avoid issues with false negatives. We show that these principles consistently improve the quality of the learned embeddings. The joint embeddings learned with CrossCLR extend the state of the art in video-text retrieval on Youcook2 and LSMDC datasets and in video captioning on the Youcook2 dataset by a large margin.

The performance of compressive imaging systems based on CAs mostly depends on two factors: the properties of the mask's attenuation pattern, that we refer to as \"codification\", and the computational techniques used to recover the quantity of interest from the coded snapshot. In this work, we introduce the idea of using time-varying CAs synchronized with spatially varying pixel shutters. We divide the exposure of a sensor into sub-exposures at the beginning of which the CA mask changes and at which the sensor's pixels are simultaneously and individually switched \"on\" or \"off\". This is a practically appealing codification as it does not introduce additional optical components other than the already present CA but uses a change in the pixel shutter that can be easily realized electronically. We show that our proposed time-multiplexed coded aperture (TMCA) can be optimized end to end and induces better coded snapshots enabling superior reconstructions in two different applications: compressive light field imaging and hyperspectral imaging. We demonstrate both in simulation and with real captures (taken with prototypes we built) that this codification outperforms the state-of-the-art compressive imaging systems by a large margin in those applications."}

Cropping view recommendation addresses the problem of image recomposition conditioned on the composition quality and the ranking of views (cropped sub-regions). This task is challenging because the visual difference is subtle when a visual element is reserved or removed. Existing methods represent visual elements by extracting region-based convolutional features inside and outside the cropping view boundaries, without probing a fundamental question: why some visual elements are of interest or of discard? In this work, we observe that the relation between different visual elements significantly affects their relative positions to the desired cropping view, and such relation can be characterized by the attraction inside/outside the cropping view boundaries and the repulsion across the boundaries. By instantiating a transformer-based solution that represents visual elements as visual words and that models the dependencies between visual words, we report not only state of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, but also interesting visualizations that depict the attraction and repulsion between visual elements, which may shed light on what makes for effective cropping view recommendation."}

Compared to state of the art, our method improves generalization and is more robust to low-quality videos, that are usually spread over social networks. In particular, we obtain an average improvement of more than 15% in terms of accuracy for facial reenactment on high compressed videos."}

We are able to control the generated image by settings exact attributes such as age, pose, expression, etc. Most approaches for manipulating GAN-generated images achieve partial control by leveraging the latent space disentanglement properties, obtained implicitly after standard GAN training. Such methods are able to change the relative intensity of certain attributes, but not explicitly set their values. Recently proposed methods, designed for explicit control over human faces, harness morphable 3D face models (3DMM) to allow fine-grained control capabilities in GANs. Unlike these methods, our control is not constrained to 3DMM parameters and is extendable beyond the domain of human faces. Using contrastive learning, we obtain GANs with an explicitly disentangled latent space. This disentanglement is utilized to train control-encoders mapping human-interpretable inputs to suitable latent vectors, thus allowing explicit control. In the domain of human faces we demonstrate control over identity, age, pose, expression, hair color and illumination. We also demonstrate control capabilities of our framework in the domains of painted portraits and dog image generation. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

However, most videos on the web or mobile devices are compressed, and the compression can be severe when the bandwidth is limited. In this paper, we propose a new compression-informed video super-resolution model to restore high-resolution content without introducing artifacts caused by compression. The proposed model consists of three modules for video super-resolution: bi-directional recurrent warping, detail-preserving flow estimation, and Laplacian enhancement. All these three modules are used to deal with compression properties such as the location of the intra-frames in the input and smoothness in the output frames. For thorough performance evaluation, we conducted extensive experiments on standard datasets with a wide range of compression rates, covering many real video use cases. We showed that our method not only recovers high-resolution content on uncompressed frames from the widely-used benchmark datasets, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in super-resolving compressed videos based on numerous quantitative metrics. We also evaluated the proposed method by simulating streaming from YouTube to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.

A major limitation of existing work is that the bit-width for each layer must be predefined during training time. This allows little flexibility if the characteristics of the device on which the network is deployed change during runtime. In this work, we propose Bit-Mixer, the very first method to train a meta-quantized network where during test time any layer can change its bit-width without affecting at all the overall network's ability for highly accurate inference. To this end, we make 2 key contributions: (a) Transitional Batch-Norms, and (b) a 3-stage optimization process which is shown capable of training such a network. We show that our method can result in mixed precision networks that exhibit the desirable flexibility properties for on-device deployment without compromising accuracy. Code will be made available."}

The common practice is to first evenly divide the image into a pre-defined number of grids and then learn to associate each pixel with its surrounding grids. However, simply applying a series of convolution operations with limited receptive fields can only implicitly perceive the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids. Consequently, existing methods often fail to provide an effective context when inferring the association map. To remedy this issue, we propose a novel Association Implantation (AI) module to enable the network to explicitly capture the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids. The proposed AI module directly implants the features of grid cells to the surrounding of its corresponding central pixel, and conducts convolution on the padded window to adaptively transfer knowledge between them. With such an implantation operation, the network could explicitly harvest the pixel-grid level context, which is more in line with the target of superpixel segmentation comparing to the pixel-wise relation. Furthermore, to pursue better boundary precision, we design a boundary-perceiving loss to help the network discriminate the pixels around boundaries in hidden feature level, which could benefit the subsequent inferring modules to accurately identify more boundary pixels. Extensive experiments on BSDS500 and NYUv2 datasets show that our method could not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but maintain satisfactory inference efficiency.

However, existing 3D virtual try-on methods mainly rely on annotated 3D human shapes and garment templates, which hinders their applications in practical scenarios. 2D virtual try-on approaches provide a faster alternative to manipulate clothed humans, but lack the rich and realistic 3D representation. In this paper, we propose a novel Monocular-to-3D Virtual Try-On Network (M3D-VTON) that builds on the merits of both 2D and 3D approaches. By integrating 2D information efficiently and learning a mapping that lifts the 2D representation to 3D, we make the first attempt to reconstruct a 3D try-on mesh only taking the target clothing and a person image as inputs. The proposed M3D-VTON includes three modules: 1) The Monocular Prediction Module (MPM) that estimates an initial full-body depth map and accomplishes 2D clothes-person alignment through a novel two-stage warping procedure; 2) The Depth Refinement Module (DRM) that refines the initial body depth to produce more detailed pleat and face characteristics; 3) The Texture Fusion Module (TFM) that fuses the warped clothing with the non-target body part to refine the results. We also construct a high-quality synthesized Monocular-to-3D virtual try-on dataset, in which each person image is associated with a front and a back depth map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed M3D-VTON can manipulate and reconstruct the 3D human body wearing the given clothing with compelling details and is more efficient than other 3D approaches."}

The key is to ensure that the discriminator receives strong supervision to perceive the concepts and moderate regularization to avoid collapse. Omni-GAN is easily implemented and freely integrated with off-the-shelf encoding methods (e.g., implicit neural representation, INR). Experiments validate the superior performance of Omni-GAN and Omni-INR-GAN in a wide range of image generation and restoration tasks.

However, existing semantic segmentation datasets are either dominated by images captured under normal conditions or are small in scale. To address this, we introduce ACDC, the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences for training and testing semantic segmentation methods on adverse visual conditions. ACDC consists of a large set of 4006 images which are equally distributed between four common adverse conditions: fog, nighttime, rain, and snow. Each adverse-condition image comes with a high-quality fine pixel-level semantic annotation, a corresponding image of the same scene taken under normal conditions, and a binary mask that distinguishes between intra-image regions of clear and uncertain semantic content. Thus, ACDC supports both standard semantic segmentation and the newly introduced uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation. A detailed empirical study demonstrates the challenges that the adverse domains of ACDC pose to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised approaches and indicates the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field.

The significant intra-class variation is the bottleneck challenge in this task yet remains unsolved so far. In this paper, we take advantage of category prior to overcome this problem by innovating a structure-guided prior adaptation scheme to accurately estimate 6D pose for individual objects. Different from existing prior-based methods, given one object and its corresponding category prior, we propose to leverage their structure similarity to dynamically adapt the prior to the observed object. The prior adaptation intrinsically associates the adopted prior with different objects, from which we can accurately reconstruct the 3D canonical model of the specific object for pose estimation. To further enhance the structure characteristic of objects, we extract low-rank structure points from the dense object point cloud, therefore more efficiently incorporating sparse structural information during prior adaptation.

In this paper, we propose VariTex - to the best of our knowledge the first method that learns a variational latent feature space of neural face textures, which allows sampling of novel identities. We combine this generative model with a parametric face model and gain explicit control over head pose and facial expressions. To generate complete images of human heads, we propose an additive decoder that adds plausible details such as hair. A novel training scheme enforces a pose-independent latent space and in consequence, allows learning a one-to-many mapping between latent codes and pose-conditioned exterior regions. The resulting method can generate geometrically consistent images of novel identities under fine-grained control over head pose, face shape, and facial expressions. This facilitates a broad range of downstream tasks, like sampling novel identities, changing the head pose, expression transfer, and more."}

In this work we propose a new approach to remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) -- the measurement of blood volume changes from observations of a person's face or skin. Similar to current state-of-the-art methods for rPPG, we apply neural networks to learn deep representations with invariance to nuisance image variation. In contrast to such methods, we employ a fully self-supervised training approach, which has no reliance on expensive ground truth physiological training data. Our proposed method uses contrastive learning with a weak prior over the frequency and temporal smoothness of the target signal of interest. We evaluate our approach on four rPPG datasets, showing that comparable or better results can be achieved compared to recent supervised deep learning methods but without using any annotation. In addition, we incorporate a learned saliency resampling module into both our unsupervised approach and supervised baseline. We show that by allowing the model to learn where to sample the input image, we can reduce the need for hand-engineered features while providing some interpretability into the model's behavior and possible failure modes. We release code for our complete training and evaluation pipeline to encourage reproducible progress in this exciting new direction."}

To effectively capture this diverse motion pattern, this paper presents a new temporal adaptive module (TAM) to generate video-specific temporal kernels based on its own feature map. TAM proposes a unique two-level adaptive modeling scheme by decoupling the dynamic kernel into a location sensitive importance map and a location invariant aggregation weight. The importance map is learned in a local temporal window to capture short-term information, while the aggregation weight is generated from a global view with a focus on long-term structure. TAM is a modular block and could be integrated into 2D CNNs to yield a powerful video architecture (TANet) with a very small extra computational cost.

However, in tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), the multimodal prediction often requires visual information from macro- to micro-views. Therefore, how to dynamically schedule the global and local dependency modeling in Transformer has become an emerging issue. In this paper, we propose an example-dependent routing scheme called TRAnsformer Routing (TRAR) to address this issue. Specifically, in TRAR, each visual Transformer layer is equipped with a routing module with different attention spans. The model can dynamically select the corresponding attentions based on the output of the previous inference step, so as to formulate the optimal routing path for each example. Notably, with careful designs, TRAR can reduce the additional computation and memory overhead to almost negligible. To validate TRAR, we conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets of VQA and REC, and achieve superior performance gains than the standard Transformers and a bunch of state-of-the-art methods."}

Standard feed-forward neural networks combine linear or, if the bias parameter is included, affine layers and activation functions. Their geometric modeling is limited, which motivated the prior work introducing the multilayer hypersphere perceptron (MLHP). Its constituent part, i.e., the hypersphere neuron, is obtained by applying a conformal embedding of Euclidean space. By virtue of Clifford algebra, it can be implemented as the Cartesian dot product of inputs and weights. If the embedding is applied in a manner consistent with the dimensionality of the input space geometry, the decision surfaces of the model units become combinations of hyperspheres and make the decision-making process geometrically interpretable for humans. Our extension of the MLHP model, the multilayer geometric perceptron (MLGP), and its respective layer units, i.e., geometric neurons, are consistent with the 3D geometry and provide a geometric handle of the learned coefficients. In particular, the geometric neuron activations are isometric in 3D, which is necessary for rotation and translation equivariance. When classifying the 3D Tetris shapes, we quantitatively show that our model requires no activation function in the hidden layers other than the embedding to outperform the vanilla multilayer perceptron. In the presence of noise in the data, our model is also superior to the MLHP."}

Neural networks, including SNNs, however, are subject to various adversarial attacks and must be trained to remain resilient against such attacks for many applications. Nevertheless, due to prohibitively high training costs associated with SNNs, analysis, and optimization of deep SNNs under various adversarial attacks have been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first present a detailed analysis of the inherent robustness of low-latency SNNs against popular gradient-based attacks, namely fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and projected gradient descent (PGD). Motivated by this analysis, to harness the model robustness against these attacks we present an SNN training algorithm that uses crafted input noise and incurs no additional training time. To evaluate the merits of our algorithm, we conducted extensive experiments with variants of VGG and ResNet on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Compared to standard trained direct input SNNs, our trained models yield improved classification accuracy of up to 13.7% and 10.1% on FGSM and PGD attack-generated images, respectively, with negligible loss in clean image accuracy.

Specifically, we define the centripetal direction feature as a class of adjacent directions pointing to the nuclear center to represent the spatial relationship between pixels within the nucleus. These direction features are then used to construct a direction difference map to represent the similarity within instances and the differences between instances. Finally, we propose a direction-guided refinement module, which acts as a plug-and-play module to effectively integrate auxiliary tasks and aggregate the features of different branches.

Previous methods usually generate an initial image with sentence embedding and then refine it with fine-grained word embedding. Despite the significant progress, the 'aspect' information (e.g., red eyes) contained in the text, referring to several words rather than a word that depicts 'a particular part or feature of something', is often ignored, which is highly helpful for synthesizing image details. How to make better utilization of aspect information in text-to-image synthesis still remains an unresolved challenge. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Aspect-awarE GAN (DAE-GAN) that represents text information comprehensively from multiple granularities, including sentence-level, word-level, and aspect-level. Moreover, inspired by human learning behaviors, we develop a novel Aspect-aware Dynamic Re-drawer (ADR) for image refinement, in which an Attended Global Refinement (AGR) module and an Aspect-aware Local Refinement (ALR) module are alternately employed. AGR utilizes word-level embedding to globally enhance the previously generated image, while ALR dynamically employs aspect-level embedding to refine image details from a local perspective. Finally, a corresponding matching loss function is designed to ensure the text-image semantic consistency at different levels.

In this paper, we propose NAS with Batch Normalization (BN), which we refer to as BN-NAS, to accelerate both the evaluation and training process. For fast evaluation, we propose a novel BN-based indicator that predicts subnet performance at a very early training stage. We further improve the training efficiency by only training the BN parameters during the supernet training. This is based on our observation that training the whole supernet is not necessary while training only BN parameters accelerates network convergence for network architecture search. Extensive experiments show that our method can significantly shorten the time of training supernet by more than 10 times and evaluating subnets by more than 600,000 times without losing accuracy."}

The core idea is that the signal of interest is stronger in some pixels (\"foreground\"), and by selectively focusing computation on these pixels, networks can extract subtle information buried in noise and other sources of corruption. Our paper is based on one key observation: in many real-world applications, many sources of corruption, such as illumination and motion, are often shared between the \"foreground\" and the \"background\" pixels. Can we utilize this to our advantage? We propose the utility of inverse attention networks, which focus on extracting information about these shared sources of corruption. We show that this helps to effectively suppress shared covariates and amplify signal information, resulting in improved performance. We illustrate this on the task of camera-based physiological measurement where the signal of interest is weak and global illumination variations and motion act as significant shared sources of corruption. We perform experiments on three datasets and show that our approach of inverse attention produces state-of-the-art results, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio by up to 5.8 dB, reducing heart rate and breathing rate estimation errors by as much as 30 %, recovering subtle waveform dynamics, and generalizing from RGB to NIR videos without retraining."}

For example, for human faces, algorithms learn to model the local shape and shading of the face components, i.e., changes in the brows, eyes, nose, mouth, jaw line, etc. This is possible because all faces have two brows, two eyes, a nose and a mouth, approximately in the same location. The modeling of complex scenes is however much more challenging because the scene components and their location vary from image to image. For example, living rooms contain a varying number of products belonging to many possible categories and locations, e.g., a lamp may or may not be present in an endless number of possible locations. In the present work, we propose to add a \"broker\" module in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to solve this problem. The broker is tasked to mediate the use of multiple discriminators in the appropriate image locales. For example, if a lamp is detected or wanted in a specific area of the scene, the broker assigns a fine-grained lamp discriminator to that image patch. This allows the generator to learn the shape and shading models of the lamp. The resulting multi-fine-grained optimization problem is able to synthesize complex scenes with almost the same level of photo-realism as single object images. We demonstrate the generability of the proposed approach on several GAN algorithms (BigGAN, ProGAN, StyleGAN, StyleGAN2), image resolutions (256x256 to 1024x1024), and datasets. Our approach yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art GAN algorithms."}

To learn generalizable representation for correspondence in large-scale, a variety of self-supervised pretext tasks are proposed to explicitly perform object-level or patch-level similarity learning. Instead of following the previous literature, we propose to learn correspondence using Video Frame-level Similarity (VFS) learning, i.e, simply learning from comparing video frames. Our work is inspired by the recent success in image-level contrastive learning and similarity learning for visual recognition. Our hypothesis is that if the representation is good for recognition, it requires the convolutional features to find correspondence between similar objects or parts. Our experiments show surprising results that VFS surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches for both OTB visual object tracking and DAVIS video object segmentation. We perform detailed analysis on what matters in VFS and reveals new properties on image and frame level similarity learning."}

The embedding is jointly trained with an adversarial network as a primitive discriminator to decide whether points are from the same primitive instance in local neighborhoods. Such local supervision encourages the learned embedding and discriminator to describe local surface properties and robustly distinguish different instances. At inference time, network predictions are followed by a region growing method to finalize the segmentation. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-arts based on mean average precision by a significant margin (46.3%) on ABC dataset [??].

However, when used in video inpainting that requires fine-grained representation, existed method still suffers from yielding blurry edges in detail due to the hard patch splitting. Here we aim to tackle this problem by proposing FuseFormer, a Transformer model designed for video inpainting via fine-grained feature fusion based on novel Soft Split and Soft Composition operations. The soft split divides feature map into many patches with given overlapping interval. On the contrary, the soft composition operates by stitching different patches into a whole feature map where pixels in overlapping regions are summed up. These two modules are first used in tokenization before Transformer layers and de-tokenization after Transformer layers, for effective mapping between tokens and features. Therefore, sub-patch level information interaction is enabled for more effective feature propagation between neighboring patches, resulting in synthesizing vivid content for hole regions in videos. Moreover, in FuseFormer, we elaborately insert the soft composition and soft split into the feed-forward network, enabling the 1D linear layers to have the capability of modelling 2D structure.

We propose a simple yet effective method, Feature Augmentation and Sampling Adaptation (FASA), that addresses the data scarcity issue by augmenting the feature space especially for rare classes. Both the Feature Augmentation (FA) and feature sampling components are adaptive to the actual training status -- FA is informed by the feature mean and variance of observed real samples from past iterations, and we sample the generated virtual features in a loss-adapted manner to avoid over-fitting. FASA does not require any elaborate loss design, and removes the need for inter-class transfer learning that often involves large cost and manually-defined head/tail class groups. We show FASA is a fast, generic method that can be easily plugged into standard or long-tailed segmentation frameworks, with consistent performance gains and little added cost. FASA is also applicable to other tasks like long-tailed classification with state-of-the-art performance."}

However, the existing deep learning-based methods encounter a common issue of a large number of parameters, which leads to the deep learning models with high time complexity and low fusion efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel discrete Tchebichef moment-based Deep neural network, termed as DTMNet, for multi-focus image fusion. The proposed DTMNet is an end-to-end deep neural network with only one convolutional layer and three fully connected layers. The convolutional layer is fixed with DTM coefficients (DTMConv) to extract high/low-frequency information without learning parameters effectively. The three fully connected layers have learnable parameters for feature classification. Therefore, the proposed DTMNet for multi-focus image fusion has a small number of parameters (0.01M paras vs. 4.93M paras of regular CNN) and high computational efficiency (0.32s vs. 79.09s by regular CNN to fuse an image). In addition, a large-scale multi-focus image dataset is synthesized for training and verifying the deep learning model. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive with or even outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-focus image fusion methods in terms of subjective visual perception and objective evaluation metrics."}

In low-light conditions where longer exposure times are necessary, motion blur can appear even for relatively slow camera motions. In this paper we present a novel hybrid visual odometry pipeline with direct approach that explicitly models and estimates the camera's local trajectory within exposure time. This allows us to actively compensate for any motion blur that occurs due to the camera motion. In addition, we also contribute a novel benchmarking dataset for motion blur aware visual odometry. In experiments we show that by directly modeling the image formation process we are able to improve robustness of the visual odometry, while keeping comparable accuracy as that for images without motion blur."}

In this paper, we found that the similar holds in the continual learning context: contrastively learned representations are more robust against the catastrophic forgetting than ones trained with the cross-entropy objective. Based on this novel observation, we propose a rehearsal-based continual learning algorithm that focuses on continually learning and maintaining transferable representations. More specifically, the proposed scheme (1) learns representations using the contrastive learning objective, and (2) preserves learned representations using a self-supervised distillation step. We conduct extensive experimental validations under popular benchmark image classification datasets, where our method sets the new state-of-the-art performance.

However, these modules require intrinsic camera information that might not be obtained accurately. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Transformation Routing (STR) mechanism to model the spatial properties without applying any geometric prior. The STR mechanism treats the spatial transformation as the message passing process, and the relation between the view poses and the routing weights is modeled by an end-to-end trainable neural network. Besides, an Occupancy Concept Mapping (OCM) framework is proposed to provide explainable rationals for scene-fusion processes. We conducted experiments on several datasets and show that the proposed STR mechanism improves the performance of the Generative Query Network (GQN). The visualization results reveal that the routing process can pass the observed information from one location of some view to the associated location in the other view, which demonstrates the advantage of the proposed model in terms of spatial cognition."}

To address this, we introduce a soft attention mechanism, called the Part Attention REgressor (PARE), that learns to predict body-part-guided attention masks. We observe that state-of-the-art methods rely on global feature representations, making them sensitive to even small occlusions. In contrast, PARE's part-guided attention mechanism overcomes these issues by exploiting information about the visibility of individual body parts while leveraging information from neighboring body-parts to predict occluded parts. We show qualitatively that PARE learns sensible attention masks, and quantitative evaluation confirms that PARE achieves more accurate and robust reconstruction results than existing approaches on both occlusion-specific and standard benchmarks.

Prior methods perform refinement by feeding zoomed-in input and rendered RGB images into a CNN and directly regressing an update of a refined pose. Their runtime is slow due to the computational cost of CNN, which is especially prominent in multiple-object pose refinement. To overcome this problem, RePOSE leverages image rendering for fast feature extraction using a 3D model with a learnable texture. We call this deep texture rendering, which uses a shallow multi-layer perceptron to directly regress a view-invariant image representation of an object. Furthermore, we utilize differentiable Levenberg-Marquard (LM) optimization to refine a pose fast and accurately by minimizing the feature-metric error between the input and rendered image representations without the need of zooming in. These image representations are trained such that differentiable LM optimization converges within few iterations. Consequently, RePOSE runs at 92 FPS and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 51.6% on the Occlusion LineMOD dataset - a 4.1% absolute improvement over the prior art, and comparable result on the YCB-Video dataset with a much faster runtime.

We leverage a question generation transformer trained on text data and use it to generate question-answer pairs from transcribed video narrations. Given narrated videos, we then automatically generate the HowToVQA69M dataset with 69M video-question-answer triplets. To handle the open vocabulary of diverse answers in this dataset, we propose a training procedure based on a contrastive loss between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer transformer. We introduce the zero-shot VideoQA task and show excellent results, in particular for rare answers. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method to significantly outperform the state of the art on MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA and How2QA.

Despite its societal importance, though, research progress in the field remains rather poor. Crucially, existing methods that yield viable performance necessitate the availability of laborious to obtain gloss sequence groundtruth. In this paper, we attenuate this need, by introducing an end-to-end SLT model that does not entail explicit use of glosses; the model only needs text groundtruth. This is in stark contrast to existing end-to-end models that use gloss sequence groundtruth, either in the form of a modality that is recognized at an intermediate model stage, or in the form of a parallel output process, jointly trained with the SLT model. Our approach constitutes a Transformer network with a novel type of layers that combines: (i) local winner-takes-all (LWTA) layers with stochastic winner sampling, instead of conventional ReLU layers, (ii) stochastic weights with posterior distributions estimated via variational inference, and (iii) a weight compression technique at inference time that exploits estimated posterior variance to perform massive, almost lossless compression. We demonstrate that our approach can reach the currently best reported BLEU-4 score on the PHOENIX 2014T benchmark, but without making use of glosses for model training, and with a memory footprint reduced by more than 70%."}

To this end, a lightweight policy network determines important regions in an image, and operations are applied on selected regions only, using custom block-sparse convolutions. Features of non-selected regions are simply copied from the preceding frame, reducing the number of computations and latency. The execution policy is trained using reinforcement learning in an online fashion without requiring ground truth annotations. Our universal framework is demonstrated on dense prediction tasks such as pedestrian detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation, using both state of the art (Center and Scale Predictor, MGAN, SwiftNet) and standard baseline networks (Mask-RCNN, DeepLabV3+).

However, fine-grained image retrieval often requires the ability to also express where in the image the content they are looking for is. The text modality can only cumbersomely express such localization preferences, whereas pointing is a more natural fit. In this paper, we propose an image retrieval setup with a new form of multimodal queries, where the user simultaneously uses both spoken natural language (the what) and mouse traces over an empty canvas (the where) to express the characteristics of the desired target image. We then describe simple modifications to an existing image retrieval model, enabling it to operate in this setup. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our model effectively takes this spatial guidance into account, and provides significantly more accurate retrieval results compared to text-only equivalent systems."}

The main challenge of the problem is the catastrophic forgetting, and for the exemplar-memory based CIL methods, it is generally known that the forgetting is commonly caused by the classification score bias that is injected due to the data imbalance between the new classes and the old classes (in the exemplar-memory). While several methods have been proposed to correct such score bias by some additional post-processing, e.g., score re-scaling or balanced fine-tuning, no systematic analysis on the root cause of such bias has been done. To that end, we analyze that computing the softmax probabilities by combining the output scores for all old and new classes could be the main cause of the bias. Then, we propose a new CIL method, dubbed as Separated Softmax for Incremental Learning (SS-IL), that consists of separated softmax (SS) output layer combined with task-wise knowledge distillation (TKD) to resolve such bias. Throughout our extensive experimental results on several large-scale CIL benchmark datasets, we show our SS-IL achieves strong state-of-the-art accuracy through attaining much more balanced prediction scores across old and new classes, without any additional post-processing."}

Despite promising progress, existing representations learned with neural networks still struggle to generalize in closed-loop predictions (e.g., output colliding trajectories). This issue largely arises from the non-i.i.d. nature of sequential prediction in conjunction with ill-distributed training data. Intuitively, if the training data only comes from human behaviors in safe spaces, i.e., from \"positive\" examples, it is difficult for learning algorithms to capture the notion of \"negative\" examples like collisions. In this work, we aim to address this issue by explicitly modeling negative examples through self-supervision: (i) we introduce a social contrastive loss that regularizes the extracted motion representation by discerning the ground-truth positive events from synthetic negative ones; (ii) we construct informative negative samples based on our prior knowledge of rare but dangerous circumstances. Our method substantially reduces the collision rates of recent trajectory forecasting, behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning algorithms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.

To prevent the wastes from getting into the ocean, it is helpful to clean up the floating wastes in inland waters using the autonomous cleaning devices like unmanned surface vehicles.

However, the small size of the target, the strong light reflection over water surface, and the reflection of other objects on bank-side all bring challenges to the vision-based object detection system. To promote the practical application for autonomous floating wastes cleaning, we present FloW, the first dataset for floating waste detection in inland water areas. The dataset consists of an image sub-dataset FloW-Img and a multimodal sub-dataset FloW-RI which contains synchronized millimeter-wave radar data and images. Accurate annotations for images and radar data are provided, supporting floating waste detection strategies based on images, radar data, and the fusion of two sensors.

Moreover, instead of merely concatenating the descriptors, HPNet optimally combines hybrid representations by learning combination weights. This weighting module builds on the entropy of input features. The output primitive segmentation is obtained from a mean-shift clustering module. Experimental results on benchmark datasets ANSI and ABCParts show that HPNet leads to significant performance gains from baseline approaches."}

We find that using the nearest-neighbor as positive in contrastive losses improves performance significantly on ImageNet classification, from 71.7% to 75.6%, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. On semi-supervised learning benchmarks we improve performance significantly when only 1% ImageNet labels are available, from 53.8% to 56.5%.

NEAT is a continuous function which maps locations in Bird's Eye View (BEV) scene coordinates to waypoints and semantics, using intermediate attention maps to iteratively compress high-dimensional 2D image features into a compact representation. This allows our model to selectively attend to relevant regions in the input while ignoring information irrelevant to the driving task, effectively associating the images with the BEV representation.

The reinforcement learning (RL) based frameworks promote the accuracy of image captioning, yet seriously hurt the diversity. In contrast, other methods based on variational auto-encoder (VAE) or generative adversarial network (GAN) can produce diverse yet less accurate captions. In this work, we devote our attention to promote the diversity of RL-based image captioning. To be specific, we devise a partial off-policy learning scheme to balance accuracy and diversity. First, we keep the model exposed to varied candidate captions by sampling from the initial state before RL launched. Second, a novel criterion named max-CIDEr is proposed to serve as the reward for promoting diversity. We combine the above-mentioned off-policy strategy with the on-policy one to moderate the exploration effect, further balancing the diversity and accuracy for human-like image captioning. Experiments show that our method locates the closest to human performance in the diversity-accuracy space, and achieves the highest Pearson correlation as 0.337 with human performance."}

Partially supervised instance segmentation aims to improve mask prediction with limited mask labels by utilizing the more abundant weak box labels. In this work, we show that a class agnostic mask head, commonly used in partially supervised instance segmentation, has difficulties learning a general concept of foreground for the weakly annotated classes using box supervision only. To resolve this problem, we introduce an object mask prior (OMP) that provides the mask head with the general concept of foreground implicitly learned by the box classification head under the supervision of all classes. This helps the class agnostic mask head to focus on the primary object in a region of interest (RoI) and improves generalization to the weakly annotated classes. We test our approach on the COCO dataset using different splits of strongly and weakly supervised classes. Our approach significantly improves over the Mask R-CNN baseline and obtains competitive performance with the state-of-the-art, while offering a much simpler architecture."}

Inspired by these advances in geometric understanding, we aim to imbue image-based perception with representations learned under geometric constraints. We introduce an approach to learn view-invariant, geometry-aware representations for network pre-training, based on multi-view RGB-D data, that can then be effectively transferred to downstream 2D tasks. We propose to employ contrastive learning under both multi-view image constraints and image-geometry constraints to encode 3D priors into learned 2D representations. This results not only in improvement over 2D-only representation learning on the image-based tasks of semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection on real-world indoor datasets, but moreover, provides significant improvement in the low data regime. We show a significant improvement of 6.0% on semantic segmentation on full data as well as 11.9% on 20% data against our baselines on ScanNet."}

Given pair-wise relative camera poses, pose-graph optimization (PGO) involves solving for an optimized set of globally-consistent absolute camera poses. In this work, we propose a novel PGO scheme fueled by graph neural networks (GNN), namely PoGO-Net, to conduct the absolute camera pose regression leveraging multiple rotation averaging (MRA). Specifically, PoGO-Net takes a noisy view-graph as the input, where the nodes and edges are designed to encode the geometric constraints and local graph consistency. Besides, we address the outlier edge removal by exploiting an implicit edge-dropping scheme where the noisy or corrupted edges are effectively filtered out with parameterized networks. Furthermore, we introduce a joint loss function embedding MRA formulation such that the robust inference is capable of achieving real-time performances even for large-scale scenes. Our proposed network is trained end-to-end on public benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in extensive experiments that demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our proposed network."}

Existing deep homography methods concatenate the input images or features, neglecting the explicit formulation of correspondences between them, which leads to degraded accuracy in cross-resolution challenges. In this paper, we consider the cross-resolution homography estimation as a multimodal problem, and propose a local transformer network embedded within a multiscale structure to explicitly learn correspondences between the multimodal inputs, namely, input images with different resolutions. The proposed local transformer adopts a local attention map specifically for each position in the feature. By combining the local transformer with the multiscale structure, the network is able to capture long-short range correspondences efficiently and accurately. Experiments on both the MS-COCO dataset and real-captured cross-resolution dataset show that the proposed network outperforms existing state-of-the-art feature-based and deep-learning-based homography estimation methods, and is able to accurately align images under 10x resolution gap."}

Outdoor LiDAR point clouds are typically large-scale and complexly distributed, which makes the registration challenging. In this paper, we propose an efficient hierarchical network named HRegNet for large-scale outdoor LiDAR point cloud registration. Instead of using all points in the point clouds, HRegNet performs registration on hierarchically extracted keypoints and descriptors. The overall framework combines the reliable features in deeper layer and the precise position information in shallower layers to achieve robust and precise registration. We present a correspondence network to generate correct and accurate keypoints correspondences. Moreover, bilateral consensus and neighborhood consensus are introduced for keypoints matching and novel similarity features are designed to incorporate them into the correspondence network, which significantly improves the registration performance. Besides, the whole network is also highly efficient since only a small number of keypoints are used for registration. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale outdoor LiDAR point cloud datasets to demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed HRegNet.

In this paper, we address this problem with the aid of neural scene representation networks. Our method is completely different from existing methods that rely on intermediate representations like 2D landmarks or 3D face models to bridge the gap between audio input and video output. Specifically, the feature of input audio signal is directly fed into a conditional implicit function to generate a dynamic neural radiance field, from which a high-fidelity talking-head video corresponding to the audio signal is synthesized using volume rendering. Another advantage of our framework is that not only the head (with hair) region is synthesized as previous methods did, but also the upper body is generated via two individual neural radiance fields. Experimental results demonstrate that our novel framework can (1) produce high-fidelity and natural results, and (2) support free adjustment of audio signals, viewing directions, and background images.

This paper presents a new algorithm called Token-Aware Cascade contrastive learning (TACo) that improves contrastive learning using two novel techniques. The first is the token-aware contrastive loss which is computed by taking into account the syntactic classes of words. This is motivated by the observation that for a video-text pair, the content words in the text, such as nouns and verbs, are more likely to be aligned with the visual contents in the video than the function words. Second, a cascade sampling method is applied to generate a small set of hard negative examples for efficient loss estimation for multi-modal fusion layers. To validate the effectiveness of TACo, in our experiments we finetune pretrained models for a set of downstream tasks including text-video retrieval (YouCook2, MSR-VTT and ActivityNet), video action step localization (CrossTask), video action segmentation (COIN). Our results show that our models attain consistent improvements across different experimental settings over previous methods, setting new state-of-the-art on three public text-video retrieval benchmarks of YouCook2, MSR-VTT and ActivityNet."}

Previous correspondence matching based methods require the inputs to have distinctive geometric structures to fit a 3D rigid transformation according to point-wise sparse feature matches. However, the accuracy of transformation heavily relies on the quality of extracted features, which are prone to errors with respect to partiality and noise. In addition, they can not utilize the geometric knowledge of all the overlapping regions. On the other hand, previous global feature based approaches can utilize the entire point cloud for the registration, however they ignore the negative effect of non-overlapping points when aggregating global features. In this paper, we present OMNet, a global feature based iterative network for partial-to-partial point cloud registration. We learn overlapping masks to reject non-overlapping regions, which converts the partial-to-partial registration to the registration of the same shape. Moreover, the previously used data is sampled only once from the CAD models for each object, resulting in the same point clouds for the source and reference. We propose a more practical manner of data generation where a CAD model is sampled twice for the source and reference, avoiding the previously prevalent over-fitting issue. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to traditional and deep learning based methods.

By contrast, despite the natural symmetry, the design of effective algorithms for exploiting large-scale language pretraining remains under-explored. In this work, we are the first to investigate the design of such algorithms and propose a novel generalized distillation method,TeachText, which leverages complementary cues from multiple text encoders to provide an enhanced supervisory signal to the retrieval model. Moreover, we extend our method to video side modalities and show that we can effectively reduce the number of used modalities at test time without compromising performance. Our approach advances the state of the art on several video retrieval benchmarks by a significant margin and adds no computational overhead at test time. Last but not least, we show an effective application of our method for eliminating noise from retrieval datasets. Code and data can be found at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/ vgg/research/teachtext/."}

Existing methods manually set a threshold to reject \"unknown\" samples based on validation or a pre-defined ratio of \"unknown\" samples, but this strategy is not practical. In this paper, we propose a method to learn the threshold using source samples and to adapt it to the target domain. Our idea is that a minimum inter-class distance in the source domain should be a good threshold to decide between \"known\" or \"unknown\" in the target. To learn the inter- and intra-class distance, we propose to train a one-vs-all classifier for each class using labeled source data. Then, we adapt the open-set classifier to the target domain by minimizing class entropy. The resulting framework is the simplest of all baselines of UNDA and is insensitive to the value of a hyper-parameter, yet outperforms baselines with a large margin."}

Without access to data, conventional data-driven model compression faces a higher risk of performance degradation. Recently, some works propose to generate images from a specific pretrained model to serve as training data. However, the inversion process only utilizes biased feature statistics stored in one model and is from low-dimension to high-dimension. As a consequence, it inevitably encounters the difficulties of generalizability and inexact inversion, which leads to unsatisfactory performance. To address these problems, we propose MixMix based on two simple yet effective techniques: (1) Feature Mixing: utilizes various models to construct a universal feature space for generalized inversion; (2) Data Mixing: mixes the synthesized images and labels to generate exact label information. We prove the effectiveness of MixMix from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Extensive experiments show that MixMix outperforms existing methods on the mainstream compression tasks, including quantization, knowledge distillation and pruning. Specifically, MixMix achieves up to 4% and 20% accuracy uplift on quantization and pruning, respectively, compared to existing data-free compression work."}

Comparing with commonly used 3D networks, VidTr is able to aggregate spatio-temporal information via stacked attentions and provide better performance with higher efficiency. We first introduce the vanilla video transformer and show that the transformer module is able to perform spatio-temporal modeling from raw pixels, but with heavy memory usage. We then present VidTr which reduces the memory cost by 3.3xwhile keeping the same performance. To further optimize the model, we propose the standard deviation based topK pooling for attention, which reduces the computation by dropping non-informative features along temporal dimension. VidTr achieves state-of-the-art performance on five commonly used datasets with lower computational requirements, showing both the efficiency and effectiveness of our design. Finally, error analysis and visualization show that VidTr is especially good at predicting actions that require long-term temporal reasoning."}

In this paper, we propose LocTex that takes advantage of the low-cost localized textual annotations (i.e., captions and synchronized mouse-over gestures) to reduce the annotation effort. We introduce a contrastive pre-training framework between images and captions and propose to supervise the cross-modal attention map with rendered mouse traces to provide coarse localization signals. Our learned visual features capture rich semantics (from free-form captions) and accurate localization (from mouse traces), which are very effective when transferred to various downstream vision tasks. Compared with ImageNet supervised pre-training, LocTex can reduce the size of the pre-training dataset by 10x or the target dataset by 2x while achieving comparable or even improved performance on COCO instance segmentation. When provided with the same amount of annotations, LocTex achieves around 4% higher accuracy than the previous state-of-the-art \"vision+language\" pre-training approach on the task of PASCAL VOC image classification."}

To minimize ambiguities in action classification, HAA500 consists of highly diversified classes of fine-grained atomic actions, where only consistent actions fall under the same label, e.g., \"\"Baseball Pitching\"\" vs \"\"Free Throw in Basketball\"\". Thus HAA500 is different from existing atomic action datasets, where coarse-grained atomic actions were labeled with coarse action-verbs such as \"\"Throw\"\". HAA500 has been carefully curated to capture the precise movement of human figures with little class-irrelevant motions or spatio-temporal label noises. The advantages of HAA500 are fourfold: 1) human-centric actions with a high average of 69.7% detectable joints for the relevant human poses; 2) high scalability since adding a new class can be done under 20-60 minutes; 3) curated videos capturing essential elements of an atomic action without irrelevant frames; 4) fine-grained atomic action classes. Our extensive experiments including cross-data validation using datasets collected in the wild demonstrate the clear benefits of human-centric and atomic characteristics of HAA500, which enable training even a baseline deep learning model to improve prediction by attending to atomic human poses. We detail the HAA500 dataset statistics and collection methodology and compare quantitatively with existing action recognition datasets."}

Specifically, we propose a self-ensembling framework where instance segmentation and semantic correspondence are jointly guided by a structured teacher in addition to the bounding box supervision. The teacher is a structured energy model incorporating a pairwise potential and a cross-image potential to model the pairwise pixel relationships both within and across the boxes. Minimizing the teacher energy simultaneously yields refined object masks and dense correspondences between intra-class objects, which are taken as pseudo-labels to supervise the task network and provide positive/negative correspondence pairs for dense contrastive learning. We show a symbiotic relationship where the two tasks mutually benefit from each other. Our best model achieves 37.9% AP on COCO instance segmentation, surpassing prior weakly supervised methods and is competitive to supervised methods. We also obtain state of the art weakly supervised results on PASCAL VOC12 and PF-PASCAL with real-time inference."}

In this paper, we propose a novel VoteNet-based 3D detector with vote enhancement to improve the detection accuracy in cluttered indoor scenes. It addresses the limitations of current voting schemes, i.e., votes from neighboring objects and background have significant negative impacts Specifically, before voting, we replace the classic MLP with the proposed Attentive MLP (AMLP) in the backbone network to get better feature description of seed points. During voting, we design a new vote attraction loss (VALoss) to enforce vote centers to locate closely and compactly to the corresponding object centers. After voting, we then devise a vote weighting module to integrate the foreground/background prediction into the vote aggregation process to enhance the capability of the original VoteNet to handle noise from background voting. The three proposed strategies all contribute to more effective voting and improved performance, resulting in a novel 3D object detector, termed VENet. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components."}

The challenges of the latter task are two folds: (1) pose failure (i.e., pose mismatching -- different skeleton definitions in dataset and SMPL , and pose ambiguity -- endpoints have arbitrary joint angle configurations for the same 3D joint coordinates). (2) shape ambiguity (i.e., the lack of shape constraints on body configuration). To address these issues, we propose Skeleton2Mesh, a novel lightweight framework that recovers human mesh from a single image. Our Skeleton2Mesh contains three modules, i.e., Differentiable Inverse Kinematics (DIK), Pose Refinement (PR) and Shape Refinement (SR) modules. DIK is designed to transfer 3D rotation from estimated 3D skeletons, which relies on a minimal set of kinematics prior knowledge. Then PR and SR modules are utilized to tackle the pose ambiguity and shape ambiguity respectively. All three modules can be incorporated into Skeleton2Mesh seamlessly via an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we utilize an adaptive joint regressor to alleviate the effects of skeletal topology from different datasets. Results on the Human3.6M dataset for human mesh recovery demonstrate that our method improves upon the previous unsupervised methods by 32.6% under the same setting. Qualitative results on in-the-wild datasets exhibit that the recovered 3D meshes are natural, realistic. Our project is available at https://sites.google.com/view/skeleton2mesh."}

Most existing works focus on either lessening the quantization error by minimizing the gap between the full-precision weights and their binarization or designing a gradient approximation to mitigate the gradient mismatch, while leaving the \"dead weights\" untouched. This leads to slow convergence when training BNNs. In this paper, for the first time, we explore the influence of \"dead weights\" which refer to a group of weights that are barely updated during the training of BNNs, and then introduce rectified clamp unit (ReCU) to revive the \"dead weights\" for updating. We prove that reviving the \"dead weights\" by ReCU can result in a smaller quantization error. Besides, we also take into account the information entropy of the weights, and then mathematically analyze why the weight standardization can benefit BNNs. We demonstrate the inherent contradiction between minimizing the quantization error and maximizing the information entropy, and then propose an adaptive exponential scheduler to identify the range of the \"dead weights\". By considering the \"dead weights\", our method offers not only faster BNN training, but also state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, compared with recent methods.

The main idea during training is that each subnetwork learns to classify only one of the multiple inputs simultaneously provided. However, the question of how to best mix these multiple inputs has not been studied so far. In this paper, we introduce MixMo, a new generalized framework for learning multi-input multi-output deep subnetworks. Our key motivation is to replace the suboptimal summing operation hidden in previous approaches by a more appropriate mixing mechanism. For that purpose, we draw inspiration from successful mixed sample data augmentations. We show that binary mixing in features - particularly with rectangular patches from CutMix - enhances results by making subnetworks stronger and more diverse. We improve state of the art for image classification on CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Our easy to implement models notably outperform data augmented deep ensembles, without the inference and memory overheads. As we operate in features and simply better leverage the expressiveness of large networks, we open a new line of research complementary to previous works."}

It is an important part of a wide range of computer vision and robotics applications, from self-driving cars to augmented/virtual reality systems. Visual localization techniques should work reliably and robustly under a wide range of conditions, including seasonal, weather, illumination and man-made changes. Recent benchmarking efforts model this by providing images under different conditions, and the community has made rapid progress on these datasets since their inception. However, they are limited to a few geographical regions and often recorded with a single device. We propose a new benchmark for visual localization in outdoor scenes, using crowd-sourced data to cover a wide range of geographical regions and camera devices with a focus on the failure cases of current algorithms. Experiments with state-of-the-art localization approaches show that our dataset is very challenging, with all evaluated methods failing on its hardest parts.

Though effective, translating the full feature map can be costly due to redundant computation on some area like the background. In this work, we encapsulate the idea of reducing spatial redundancy into a novel poll and pool (PnP) sampling module, with which we build an end-to-end PnP-DETR architecture that adaptively allocates its computation spatially to be more efficient. Concretely, the PnP module abstracts the image feature map into fine foreground object feature vectors and a small number of coarse background contextual feature vectors. The transformer models information interaction within the fine-coarse feature space and translates the features into the detection result. Moreover, the PnP-augmented model can instantly achieve various desired trade-offs between performance and computation with a single model by varying the sampled feature length, without requiring to train multiple models as existing methods. Thus it offers greater flexibility for deployment in diverse scenarios with varying computation constraint. We further validate the generalizability of the PnP module on panoptic segmentation and the recent transformer-based image recognition model ViT and show consistent efficiency gain. We believe our method makes a step for efficient visual analysis with transformers, wherein spatial redundancy is commonly observed. Code and models will be available."}

Different from previous methods, PlaneTR jointly leverages the context information and the geometric structures in a sequence-to-sequence way to holistically detect plane instances in one forward pass. Specifically, we represent the geometric structures as line segments and conduct the network with three main components: (i) context and line segments encoders, (ii) a structure-guided plane decoder, (iii) a pixel-wise plane embedding decoder. Given an image and its detected line segments, PlaneTR generates the context and line segment sequences via two specially designed encoders and then feeds them into a Transformers-based decoder to directly predict a sequence of plane instances by simultaneously considering the context and global structure cues. Finally, the pixel-wise embeddings are computed to assign each pixel to one predicted plane instance which is nearest to it in embedding space. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PlaneTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet and NYUv2 datasets."}

SNNs distribute the analog values of pixel intensities into binary spikes over time. However, the most widely used input coding schemes, such as Poisson based rate-coding, do not leverage the additional temporal learning capability of SNNs effectively. Moreover, these SNNs suffer from high inference latency which is a major bottleneck to their deployment. To overcome this, we propose a time-based encoding scheme that utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to reduce the number of timesteps required for inference. DCT decomposes an image into a weighted sum of sinusoidal basis images. At each time step, a single frequency base, taken in order and modulated by its corresponding DCT coefficient, is input to an accumulator that generates spikes upon crossing a threshold. We use the proposed scheme to learn DCT-SNN, a low-latency deep SNN with leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons, trained using surrogate gradient descent based backpropagation. We achieve top-1 accuracy of 89.94%, 68.3% and 52.43% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively using VGG architectures. Notably, DCT-SNN performs inference with 2-14X reduced latency compared to other state-of-the-art SNNs, while achieving comparable accuracy to their standard deep learning counterparts. The dimension of the transform allows us to control the number of timesteps required for inference. Additionally, we can trade-off accuracy with latency in a principled manner by dropping the highest frequency components during inference. The code is publicly available*."}

With our new datasets, we take stock of previously proposed methods for improving out-of-distribution robustness and put them to the test. We find that using larger models and artificial data augmentations can improve robustness on real-world distribution shifts, contrary to claims in prior work. We find improvements in artificial robustness benchmarks can transfer to real-world distribution shifts, contrary to claims in prior work. Motivated by our observation that data augmentations can help with real-world distribution shifts, we also introduce a new data augmentation method which advances the state-of-the-art and outperforms models pretrained with 1000x more labeled data. Overall we find that some methods consistently help with distribution shifts in texture and local image statistics, but these methods do not help with some other distribution shifts like geographic changes. Our results show that future research must study multiple distribution shifts simultaneously, as we demonstrate that no evaluated method consistently improves robustness."}

The resulting 'field of junctions' is simultaneously a contour detector, corner/junction detector, and boundary-aware smoothing of regional appearance. Notably, its unified analysis of contours, corners, junctions and uniform regions allows it to succeed at high noise levels, where other methods for segmentation and boundary detection fail."}

In this paper, we make a further step towards continual learning of the implicit scene representation directly from sequential observations, namely Continual Neural Mapping. The proposed problem setting bridges the gap between batch-trained implicit neural representations and commonly used streaming data in robotics and vision communities. We introduce an experience replay approach to tackle an exemplary task of continual neural mapping: approximating a continuous signed distance function (SDF) from sequential depth images as a scene geometry representation. We show for the first time that a single network can represent scene geometry over time continually without catastrophic forgetting, while achieving promising trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency."}

However, existing models suffer from the key practical limitation of modelling shapes holistically and thus cannot perform conditional sampling, i.e. they are not able to generate variants on individual parts of generated shapes without modifying the rest of the shape. This is limiting for applications such as 3D CAD design that involve adjusting created shapes at multiple levels of detail. To address this, we introduce LSD-StructureNet, an augmentation to the StructureNet architecture that enables re-generation of parts situated at arbitrary positions in the hierarchies of its outputs. We achieve this by learning individual, probabilistic conditional decoders for each hierarchy depth. We evaluate LSD-StructureNet on the PartNet dataset, the largest dataset of 3D shapes represented by hierarchies of parts. Our results show that contrarily to existing methods, LSD-StructureNet can perform conditional sampling without impacting inference speed or the realism and diversity of its outputs."}

Besides, we also contribute a progressive data augmentation and labeling strategy to facilitate model training with pseudo-labeled data.

While some researchers have demonstrated that Transformer-based models enjoy a favorable ability of fitting data, there are still growing number of evidences showing that these models suffer over-fitting especially when the training data is limited. This paper offers an empirical study by performing step-by-step operations to gradually transit a Transformer-based model to a convolution-based model. The results we obtain during the transition process deliver useful messages for improving visual recognition. Based on these observations, we propose a new architecture named Visformer, which is abbreviated from the 'Vision-friendly Transformer'. With the same computational complexity, Visformer outperforms both the Transformer-based and convolution-based models in terms of ImageNet classification accuracy, and the advantage becomes more significant when the model complexity is lower or the training set is smaller.

We conduct a large-scale transfer learning study which tests different ImageNet backbones, always using the same read out architecture and learning protocol adopted from DeepGaze II. By replacing the VGG19 backbone of DeepGaze II with ResNet50 features we improve the performance on saliency prediction from 78% to 85%. However, as we continue to test better ImageNet models as backbones - such as EfficientNetB5 - we observe no additional improvement on saliency prediction. By analyzing the backbones further, we find that generalization to other datasets differs substantially, with models being consistently overconfident in their fixation predictions. We show that by combining multiple backbones in a principled manner a good confidence calibration on unseen datasets can be achieved. This new model \"DeepGaze IIE\" yields a significant leap in benchmark performance in and out-of-domain with a 15 percent point improvement over DeepGaze II to 93% on MIT1003, marking a new state of the art on the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark in all available metrics (AUC: 88.3%, sAUC: 79.4%, CC: 82.4%)."}

In K-way classification, this is crisply formulated as open-set recognition, core to which is the ability to discriminate open-set data outside the K closed-set classes. Two conceptually elegant ideas for open-set discrimination are: 1) discriminatively learning an open-vs-closed binary discriminator by exploiting some outlier data as the open-set, and 2) unsupervised learning the closed-set data distribution with a GAN and using its discriminator as the open-set likelihood function. However, the former generalizes poorly to diverse open test data due to overfitting to the training outliers, which unlikely exhaustively span the open-world. The latter does not work well, presumably due to the instable training of GANs. Motivated by the above, we propose OpenGAN, which addresses the limitation of each approach by combining them with several technical insights. First, we show that a carefully selected GAN-discriminator on some real outlier data already achieves the state-of-the-art. Second, we augment the available set of real open training examples with adversarially synthesized \"\"fake\"\" data. Third and most importantly, we build the discriminator over the features computed by the closed-world K-way networks. Extensive experiments show that OpenGAN significantly outperforms prior open-set methods."}

This building block combines the ideas of spatial transformers and multi-view convolutional networks with the efficiency of standard convolutional layers in two and three-dimensional dense grids. The new block operates via multiple parallel heads, whereas each head differentiably rasterizes feature representations of individual points into a low-dimensional space, and then uses dense convolution to propagate information across points. The results of the processing of individual heads are then combined together resulting in the update of point features. Using the new block, we build architectures for both discriminative (point cloud segmentation, point cloud classification) and generative (point cloud inpainting and image-based point cloud reconstruction) tasks. The resulting architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance for these tasks, demonstrating the versatility of the new block for point cloud processing."}

Existing frame-by-frame estimating approaches can not guarantee the physical plausibility (e.g. penetration, jittering) directly. In this paper, we embed physical constraints on the per-frame estimated motions in both spatial and temporal space. Our key idea is to adopt a self-supervised learning strategy to train a novel encoder-decoder, named TravelNet, whose training motion data is prepared by the physics engine using discrete pose states. TravelNet captures key pose states from hand motion sequences as compact motion descriptors, inspired by the concept of keyframes in animation. Finally, it manages to extract those key states out of perturbations without manual annotations, and reconstruct the motions preserving details and physical plausibility. In the experiments, we show that the outputs of the TravelNet contain both finger synergism and time consistency. Through the proposed framework, hand motions can be accurately reconstructed and flexibly re-edited, which is superior to the state-of-the-art methods."}

This is because such models solely depend on visual information for text recognition, thus lacking semantic reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we argue that semantic information offers a complementary role in addition to visual only. More specifically, we additionally utilize semantic information by proposing a multi-stage multi-scale attentional decoder that performs joint visual-semantic reasoning. Our novelty lies in the intuition that for text recognition, prediction should be refined in a stage-wise manner. Therefore our key contribution is in designing a stage-wise unrolling attentional decoder where non-differentiability, invoked by discretely predicted character labels, needs to be bypassed for end-to-end training. While the first stage predicts using visual features, subsequent stages refine on-top of it using joint visual-semantic information. Additionally, we introduce multi-scale 2D attention along with dense and residual connections between different stages to deal with varying scales of character sizes, for better performance and faster convergence during training. Experimental results show our approach to outperform existing SOTA methods by a considerable margin."}

However, the popular DensePose-COCO dataset relies on a sophisticated manual annotation system, leading to severe limitations in acquiring the denser and more accurate annotated pose resources. In this work, we introduce a new 3D human-body model with a series of decoupled parameters that could freely control the generation of the body. Furthermore, we build a data generation system based on this decoupling 3D model, and construct an ultra dense synthetic benchmark UltraPose, containing around 1.3 billion corresponding points. Compared to the existing manually annotated DensePose-COCO dataset, the synthetic UltraPose has ultra dense image-to-surface correspondences without annotation cost and error. Our proposed UltraPose provides the largest benchmark and data resources for lifting the model capability in predicting more accurate dense poses. To promote future researches in this field, we also propose a transformer-based method to model the dense correspondence between 2D and 3D worlds. The proposed model trained on synthetic UltraPose can be applied to real-world scenarios, indicating the effectiveness of our benchmark and model."}

Existing WSOD methods take various techniques to pursue single \"high-quality\" pseudo label from low-cost annotations and then develop their saliency networks. Though these methods have achieved good performance, the generated single label is inevitably affected by adopted refinement algorithms and shows prejudiced characteristics which further influence the saliency networks. In this work, we introduce a new multiple-pseudo label framework to integrate more comprehensive and accurate saliency cues from multiple labels, avoiding the aforementioned problem. Specifically, we propose a multi-filer directive network (MFNet) including a saliency network as well as multiple directive filters. The directive filter (DF) is designed to extract and filter more accurate saliency cues from the noisy pseudo labels. The multiple accurate cues from multiple DFs are then simultaneously propagated to the saliency network with a multi-guidance loss. Extensive experiments on five datasets over four metrics demonstrate that our method outperforms all the existing congeneric methods. Moreover, it is also worth noting that our framework is flexible enough to apply to existing methods and improve their performance."}

To encourage an early and accurate decision, existing approaches typically focus on capturing the cues of spatial and temporal context before a future accident occurs. However, their decision-making lacks visual explanation and ignores the dynamic interaction with the environment. In this paper, we propose Deep ReInforced accident anticipation with Visual Explanation, named DRIVE. The method simulates both the bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism in a dashcam observation environment so that the decision from the proposed stochastic multi-task agent can be visually explained by attentive regions. Moreover, the proposed dense anticipation reward and sparse fixation reward are effective in training the DRIVE model with our improved reinforcement learning algorithm.

It has been applied in a broad range of applications in vision, deep learning and medical images. By Brenier theory, computing the optimal transport map is equivalent to solving a Monge-Ampere equation. Due to the highly non-linear nature, the computation of optimal transportation maps in large scale is very challenging.  This work proposes a simple but powerful method, the FFT-OT algorithm, to tackle this difficulty based on three key ideas. First, solving Monge-Ampere equation is converted to a fixed point problem; Second, the obliqueness property of optimal transportation maps are reformulated as Neumann boundary conditions on rectangular domains; Third, FFT is applied in each iteration to solve a Poisson equation in order to improve the efficiency.  Experiments on surfaces captured from 3D scanning and reconstructed from medical imaging are conducted, and compared with other existing methods. Our experimental results show that the proposed FFT-OT algorithm is simple, general and scalable with high efficiency and accuracy."}

A simple solution is to generate various large-scale MVS datasets, but generating dense ground truth for 3D structure requires a huge amount of time and resources. On the other hand, if the reliance on dense ground truth is relaxed, MVS systems will generalize more smoothly to new environments. To this end, we first introduce a novel semi-supervised multi-view stereo framework called a Sparse Ground truth-based MVS Network (SGT-MVSNet) that can reliably reconstruct the 3D structures even with a few ground truth 3D points. Our strategy is to divide the accurate and erroneous regions and individually conquer them based on our observation that a probability map can separate these regions. We propose a self-supervision loss called the 3D Point Consistency Loss to enhance the 3D reconstruction performance, which forces the 3D points back-projected from the corresponding pixels by the predicted depth values to meet at the same 3D coordinates. Finally, we propagate these improved depth predictions toward edges and occlusions by the Coarse-to-fine Reliable Depth Propagation module. We generate the spare ground truth of the DTU dataset for evaluation and extensive experiments verify that our SGT-MVSNet outperforms the state-of-the-art MVS methods on the sparse ground truth setting. Moreover, our method shows comparable reconstruction results to the supervised MVS methods though we only used tens and hundreds of ground truth 3D points."}

To address these issues, we propose a novel group activity recognition network termed GroupFormer. It captures spatial-temporal contextual information jointly to augment the individual and group representations effectively with a clustered spatial-temporal transformer. Specifically, our GroupFormer has three appealing advantages: (1) A tailor-modified Transformer, Clustered Spatial-Temporal Transformer, is proposed to enhance the individual and group representation. (2) It models the spatial and temporal dependencies integrally and utilizes decoders to build the bridge between the spatial and temporal information. (3) A clustered attention mechanism is utilized to dynamically divide individuals into multiple clusters for better learning activity-aware semantic representations.

In this work, we find that the segmentation performance can be considerably boosted if we treat object boundaries properly. For that, we propose a novel method called BAPA-Net, which is based on a convolutional neural network via Boundary Adaptation and Prototype Alignment, under the unsupervised domain adaptation setting. Specifically, we first construct additional images by pasting objects from source images to target images, and we develop a so-called boundary adaptation module to weigh each pixel based on its distance to the nearest boundary pixel of those pasted source objects. Moreover, we pro- pose another prototype alignment module to reduce the domain mismatch by minimizing distances between the class prototypes of the source and target domains, where boundaries are removed to avoid domain confusion during prototype calculation. By integrating the boundary adaptation and prototype alignment, we are able to train a discriminative and domain-invariant model for cross-domain semantic segmentation. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets of urban scenes (i.e., GTA5->Cityscapes and SYNTHIA->Cityscapes). And the promising results clearly show the effectiveness of our BAPA-Net method over existing state-of-the-art for cross-domain semantic segmentation.

The model is supplemented by a message passing interface over the graphs to fuse these different levels of interactions efficiently. Furthermore, to incorporate a real-world challenge, we propound to learn an indicator representing whether an estimated body joint is visible/invisible at each frame, e.g. due to occlusion or being outside the sensor field of view. Finally, we introduce a new benchmark for this joint task based on two challenging datasets (PoseTrack and 3DPW) and propose evaluation metrics to measure the effectiveness of predictions in the global space, even when there are invisible cases of joints.

Those methods learn different ways to aggregate information from multiple views. However, the camera view-points for those views tend to be heuristically set and fixed for all shapes.

In particular, we introduce the Multi-View Transformation Network (MVTN) that regresses optimal view-points for 3D shape recognition, building upon advances in differentiable rendering. As a result, MVTN can be trained end-to-end along with any multi-view network for 3D shape classification. We integrate MVTN in a novel adaptive multi-view pipeline that can render either 3D meshes or point clouds. MVTN exhibits clear performance gains in the tasks of 3D shape classification and 3D shape retrieval without the need for extra training supervision. In these tasks, MVTN achieves state-of-the-art performance on ModelNet40, ShapeNet Core55, and the most recent and realistic ScanObjectNN dataset (up to 6 % improvement). Interestingly, we also show that MVTN can provide network robustness against rotation and occlusion in the 3D domain."}

Recent NeRF-based advances have gained popularity for remarkable realistic novel view synthesis. However, most of them heavily rely on accurate camera poses estimation, while few recent methods can only optimize the unknown camera poses in roughly forward-facing scenes with relatively short camera trajectories and require rough camera poses initialization. Differently, our GNeRF only utilizes randomly initialized poses for complex outside-in scenarios. We propose a novel two-phases end-to-end framework. The first phase takes the use of GANs into the new realm for optimizing coarse camera poses and radiance fields jointly, while the second phase refines them with additional photometric loss. We overcome local minima using a hybrid and iterative optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on a variety of synthetic and natural scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of GNeRF.

Relying on temporal continuity in videos, our work assumes that the 3D scene structure in nearby video frames remains static. Given a sequence of video frames as input, the Video Autoencoder extracts a disentangled representation of the scene including: (i) a temporally-consistent deep voxel feature to represent the 3D structure and (ii) a 3D trajectory of camera poses for each frame. These two representations will then be re-entangled for rendering the input video frames. Video Autoencoder can be trained directly using a pixel reconstruction loss, without any ground truth 3D or camera pose annotations. The disentangled representation can be applied to a range of tasks, including novel view synthesis, camera pose estimation, and video generation by motion following.

Due to catastrophic forgetting problems of deep neural networks and large discrepancies between the previously learned and current new human actions from different categories, the neural networks may \"forget\" old actions, when learning new actions. This makes online continual action recognition a challenging task. We observe that although different human actions may vary to a large extent as a whole, their local body parts could share similar features. Therefore, we propose an Elastic Semantic Network (Else-Net) to learn new actions by decomposing human bodies into several semantic body parts. For each body part, the proposed Else-Net constructs a semantic pathway using several elastic cells learned with old actions, or explores new cells to store new knowledge."}

Critically, we also derive an accurate single-trial estimator of the variance of our method and demonstrate that this estimator is empirically accurate at low sample counts, enabling a practitioner to know how well they can trust a given low-sample estimate. When validating state-of-the-art semi-supervised models on ImageNet and iNaturalist2017, our method achieves the same estimates of model performance with up to 10x fewer labels than competing approaches.

To overcome this, recent learning-based methods have attempted to learn a good matching prior within a model itself on large training data. The performance improvement was apparent, but the need for sufficient training data and intensive learning hinders their applicability. Moreover, using the fixed model at test time does not account for the fact that a pair of images may require their own prior, thus providing limited performance and poor generalization to unseen images. In this paper, we show that an image pair-specific prior can be captured by solely optimizing the untrained matching networks on an input pair of images. Tailored for such test-time optimization for dense correspondence, we present a residual matching network and a confidence-aware contrastive loss to guarantee a meaningful convergence. Experiments demonstrate that our framework, dubbed Deep Matching Prior (DMP), is competitive, or even outperforms, against the latest learning-based methods on several benchmarks for geometric matching and semantic matching, even though it requires neither large training data nor intensive learning. With the networks pre-trained, DMP attains state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks."}

DualPoseNet stacks two parallel pose decoders on top of a shared pose encoder, where the implicit decoder predicts object poses with a working mechanism different from that of the explicit one; they thus impose complementary supervision on the training of pose encoder.

Visual information is acquired in the form of events that are triggered by local brightness changes. However, because most brightness changes are triggered by relative motion of the camera and the scene, the events recorded at a single sensor location seldom correspond to the same world point. To extract meaningful information from event cameras, it is helpful to register events that were triggered by the same underlying world point. In this work we propose a new model of event data that captures its natural spatio-temporal structure. We start by developing a model for aligned event data. That is, we develop a model for the data as though it has been perfectly registered already. In particular, we model the aligned data as a spatio-temporal Poisson point process. Based on this model, we develop a maximum likelihood approach to registering events that are not yet aligned. That is, we find transformations of the observed events that make them as likely as possible under our model. In particular we extract the camera rotation that leads to the best event alignment. We show new state of the art accuracy for rotational velocity estimation on the DAVIS 240C dataset [??].

Due to the lack of supervision signals for the correspondence between missing regions and known regions, it may fail to find proper reference features, which often leads to artifacts in the results. Also, it computes pair-wise similarity across the entire feature map during inference bringing a significant computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose to teach such patch-borrowing behavior to an attention-free generator by joint training of an auxiliary contextual reconstruction task, which encourages the generated output to be plausible even when reconstructed by surrounding regions. The auxiliary branch can be seen as a learnable loss function, i.e. named as contextual reconstruction (CR) loss, where query-reference feature similarity and reference-based reconstructor are jointly optimized with the inpainting generator. The auxiliary branch (i.e. CR loss) is required only during training, and only the inpainting generator is required during the inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed inpainting model compares favourably against the state-of-the-art in terms of quantitative and visual performance.

In particular, we learn a diverse joint distribution over multi-agent future trajectories in a traffic scene that covers a wide range of future modes with high sample efficiency while leveraging the expressive power of generative models. Unlike previous work in diverse motion forecasting, our diversity objective explicitly rewards sampling future scenarios that require distinct reactions from the self-driving vehicle for improved safety. Our contingency planner then finds comfortable and non-conservative trajectories that ensure safe reactions to a wide range of future scenarios. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our model demonstrates significantly more diverse and sample-efficient motion forecasting in a large-scale self-driving dataset as well as safer and less conservative motion plans in long-term closed-loop simulations when compared to current state-of-the-art models."}

However, the unbalanced competition among operations that have different trainable parameters causes the model collapse. Besides, the inconsistent structures in the search and retraining stages causes cross-stage evaluation to be unstable. In this paper, we call these issues as an operation gap and a structure gap in DARTS. To shrink these gaps, we propose to induce equalized and consistent optimization in differentiable architecture search (EC-DARTS). EC-DARTS decouples different operations based on their categories to optimize the operation weights so that the operation gap between them is shrinked. Besides, we introduce an induced structural transition to bridge the structure gap between the model structures in the search and retraining stages. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, on CIFAR10, we achieve a test error of 2.39%, while only 0.3 GPU days on NVIDIA TITAN V. On ImageNet, our method achieves a top-1 error of 23.6% under the mobile setting."}

Labelling is a tedious process that can take hours per image. Automatically annotating video sequences by propagating sparsely labeled frames through time is a more scalable alternative. In this work, we propose a novel label propagation method, termed Warp-Refine Propagation, that combines semantic cues with geometric cues to efficiently auto-label videos. Our method learns to refine geometrically-warped labels and infuse them with learned semantic priors in a semi-supervised setting by leveraging cycle consistency across time. We quantitatively show that our method improves label-propagation by a noteworthy margin of 13.1 mIoU on the ApolloScape dataset. Furthermore, by training with the auto-labelled frames, we achieve competitive results on three semantic-segmentation benchmarks, improving the state-of-the-art by a large margin of 1.8 and 3.61 mIoU on NYU-V2 and KITTI, while matching the current best results on Cityscapes."}

However, due to the stochasticity of the generative process in DDPM, it is challenging to generate images with the desired semantics. In this work, we propose Iterative Latent Variable Refinement (ILVR), a method to guide the generative process in DDPM to generate high-quality images based on a given reference image. Here, the refinement of the generative process in DDPM enables a single DDPM to sample images from various sets directed by the reference image. The proposed ILVR method generates high-quality images while controlling the generation. The controllability of our method allows adaptation of a single DDPM without any additional learning in various image generation tasks, such as generation from various downsampling factors, multi-domain image translation, paint-to-image, and editing with scribbles."}

In this work, we propose a one-stage visual-linguistic transformer based framework called STVGBert for the STVG task, which can simultaneously localize the target object in both spatial and temporal domains. Specifically, without resorting to pre-generated object proposals, our STVGBert directly takes a video and a query sentence as the input, and then produces the cross-modal features by using the newly introduced cross-modal feature learning module ST-ViLBert. Based on the cross-modal features, our method then generates bounding boxes and predicts the starting and ending frames to produce the predicted object tube. To the best of our knowledge, our STVGBert is the first one-stage method, which can handle the STVG task without relying on any pre-trained object detectors.

Given a sequence of scans of a subject in various poses, we learn to animate the character for new poses. Existing methods have relied on template-based representations of the human body(or clothing). However such models usually have fixed and limited resolutions, and require difficult data pre-processing steps, and cannot be used for complex clothing. We draw inspiration from template-based methods, which factorize motion into articulation and non-rigid deformation, but generalize this concept for implicit shape learning to obtain a more flexible model. We learn to map every point in the space to a canonical space, where a learned deformation field is applied to model non-rigid effects, before evaluating the signed distance field. Our formulation allows the learning of complex and non-rigid deformations of clothing and soft tissue, without computing a template registration as it is common with current approaches. Neural-GIF can be trained on raw 3D scans and reconstructs detailed complex surface geometry and deformations. Moreover, the model can generalize to new poses. We evaluate our method on a variety of characters from different public datasets in diverse clothing styles and show significant improvement over baseline methods, quantitatively and qualitatively. We also extend our model to multiple shape setting. To stimulate further research, we will make the model, code, and data publicly available."}

However, 3D visual tracking is still under-explored. Inspired by the idea of Hough voting in 3D object detection, in this paper, we propose a Multi-level Voting Siamese Network (MLVSNet) for 3D visual tracking from outdoor point cloud sequences. To deal with sparsity in outdoor 3D point clouds, we propose to perform Hough voting on multi-level features to get more vote centers and retain more useful information, instead of voting only on the final level feature as in previous methods. We also design an efficient and lightweight Target-Guided Attention (TGA) module to transfer the target information and highlight the target points in the search area. Moreover, we propose a Vote-cluster Feature Enhancement (VFE) module to exploit the relationships between different vote clusters.

Existing algorithms bypass such trade-off by a multi-stage training process: pre-training on imbalanced set and fine-tuning on balanced set. Though achieving promising performance, not only are they sensitive to the generalizability of the pre-trained model, but also not easily integrated into other computer vision tasks like detection and segmentation, where pre-training of classifier solely is not applicable. In this paper, we propose a one-stage long-tailed recognition scheme, ally complementary experts (ACE), where the expert is the most knowledgeable specialist in a sub-set that dominates its training, and is complementary to other experts in the less-seen categories without disturbed by what it has never seen. We design a distribution-adaptive optimizer to adjust the learning pace of each expert to avoid over-fitting. Without special bells and whistles, the vanilla ACE outperforms the current one-stage SOTA method by 3 10% on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist datasets. It is also shown to be the first one to break the \"seesaw\" trade-off by improving the accuracy of the majority and minority categories simultaneously in only one stage."}

However, large age gap still remains a big challenge due to significant alterations in facial appearance and bone structure. Disentanglement plays a key role in partitioning face representations into identity-dependent and age-dependent components for age-invariant face recognition (AIFR). In this paper we propose a multi-task learning framework based on mutual information minimization (MT-MIM), which casts the disentangled representation learning as an objective of information constraints. The method trains a disentanglement network to minimize mutual information between the identity component and age component of the face image from the same person, and reduce the effect of age variations during the identification process. For quantitative measure of the degree of disentanglement, we verify that mutual information can represent as metric. The resulting identity-dependent representations are used for age-invariant face recognition. We evaluate MT-MIM on popular public-domain face aging datasets (FG-NET, MORPH Album 2, CACD and AgeDB) and obtained significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our method exceeds the baseline models by over 0.4% on MORPH Album 2, and over 0.7% on CACD subsets, which are impressive improvements at the high accuracy levels of above 99% and an average of 94%."}

However, 2 bits are required to encode the ternary representation with only 3 quantization levels leveraged. As a result, conventional TNNs have similar memory consumption and speed compared with the standard 2-bit models, but have worse representational capability. Moreover, there is still a significant gap in accuracy between TNNs and full-precision networks, hampering their deployment to real applications. To tackle these two challenges, in this work, we first show that, under some mild constraints, computational complexity of the ternary inner product can be reduced by 2x. Second, to mitigate the performance gap, we elaborately design an implementation-dependent ternary quantization algorithm. The proposed framework is termed Fast and Accurate Ternary Neural Networks (FATNN). Experiments on image classification demonstrate that our FATNN surpasses the state-of-the-arts by a significant margin in accuracy. More importantly, speedup evaluation compared with various precisions is analyzed on several platforms, which serves as a strong benchmark for further research."}

In contrast, learning new objects from only a few examples could enable many impactful applications from robotics to user personalization. Most few-shot learning research, however, has been driven by benchmark datasets that lack the high variation that these applications will face when deployed in the real-world. To close this gap, we present the ORBIT dataset and benchmark, grounded in the real-world application of teachable object recognizers for people who are blind/low-vision. The dataset contains 3,822 videos of 486 objects recorded by people who are blind/low-vision on their mobile phones. The benchmark reflects a realistic, highly challenging recognition problem, providing a rich playground to drive research in robustness to few-shot, high-variation conditions.

Although there exist vast amounts of remote sensing data, most of it remains unlabeled and thus inaccessible for supervised learning algorithms. Transfer learning approaches can reduce the data requirements of deep learning algorithms. However, most of these methods are pre-trained on ImageNet and their generalization to remote sensing imagery is not guaranteed due to the domain gap. In this work, we propose Seasonal Contrast (SeCo), an effective pipeline to leverage unlabeled data for in-domain pre-training of remote sensing representations. The SeCo pipeline is composed of two parts. First, a principled procedure to gather large-scale, unlabeled and uncurated remote sensing datasets containing images from multiple Earth locations at different timestamps. Second, a self-supervised algorithm that takes advantage of time and position invariance to learn transferable representations for remote sensing applications. We empirically show that models trained with SeCo achieve better performance than their ImageNet pre-trained counterparts and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods on multiple downstream tasks. The datasets and models in SeCo will be made public to facilitate transfer learning and enable rapid progress in remote sensing applications."}

This work presents a framework to bring art closer to people by generating comprehensive descriptions of fine-art paintings. Generating informative descriptions for artworks, however, is extremely challenging, as it requires to 1) describe multiple aspects of the image such as its style, content, or composition, and 2) provide background and contextual knowledge about the artist, their influences, or the historical period. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-topic and knowledgeable art description framework, which modules the generated sentences according to three artistic topics and, additionally, enhances each description with external knowledge. The framework is validated through an exhaustive analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, as well as a comparative human evaluation, demonstrating outstanding results in terms of both topic diversity and information veracity."}

One limitation of NeRF, however, is its requirement of known camera poses to learn the scene representations. In this paper, we propose Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Fields (BARF) for training NeRF from imperfect camera poses -- the joint problem of learning neural 3D representations and registering camera frames. We establish a theoretical connection to classical planar image registration and show that coarse-to-fine registration is also applicable to NeRF. Furthermore, we demonstrate mathematically that positional encoding has a direct impact on the basin of attraction for registration with a synthesis-based objective. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that BARF can effectively optimize the neural scene representations and resolve large camera pose misalignment at the same time. This enables applications of view synthesis and localization of video sequences from unknown camera poses, opening up new avenues for visual localization systems (e.g. SLAM) towards sequential registration with NeRF."}

This has motivated research in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) algorithms for detection. UDA methods learn to adapt from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, by inducing alignment between detector features from source and target domains. Yet, there is no consensus on what features to align and how to do the alignment. In our work, we propose a framework that generalizes the different components commonly used by UDA methods laying the ground for an in-depth analysis of the UDA design space. Specifically, we propose a novel UDA algorithm, ViSGA, a direct implementation of our framework, that leverages the best design choices and introduces a simple but effective method to aggregate features at the instance-level based on the visual similarity before inducing group alignment via adversarial training. We show that both similarity-based grouping and adversarial training allows our model to focus on coarsely aligning feature groups, without being forced to match all instances across loosely aligned domains. Finally, we examine the applicability of ViSGA to the setting where labeled data are gathered from different sources. Experiments show that not only our method outperforms previous single-source approaches on Sim2Real and Adverse Weather, but also generalizes well to the multi-source setting."}

Specifically, a pair of dual sub-tasks, image colorization and text completion, is designed. In the former task, rich text information is learned to colorize gray images, and the latter one requests the model to understand the image and complete color word vacancies in the captions. The two sub-tasks enable models to learn correct alignments between text phrases and image regions, so that rich multimodal representations can be learned.

The point cloud is partial as it is obtained by a depth sensor capturing only the visible part of the object from a certain viewpoint. It introduces two main challenges: 1) two partial point clouds do not fully overlap and 2) keypoints tend to be less reliable when the visible part of the object does not have salient local structures. To address these issues, we propose DeepPRO, a keypoint-free and an end-to-end trainable deep neural network. Its core idea is inspired by how humans align two point clouds: we can imagine how two point clouds will look like after the registration based on their shape. To realize the idea, DeepPRO has inputs of two partial point clouds and directly predicts the point-wise location of the aligned point cloud. By preserving the ordering of points during the prediction, we enjoy dense correspondences between input and predicted point clouds when inferring rigid transform parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world Linemod and synthetic ModelNet40 datasets. In addition, we collect and evaluate on the PRO1k dataset, a large-scale version of Linemod meant to test generalization to real-world scans. Results show that DeepPRO achieves the best accuracy against thirteen strong baseline methods, e.g., 2.2mm ADD on the Linemod dataset, while running 50 fps on mobile devices."}

Continual learning settings where new classes are learned in incremental steps and previous training data is no longer available are challenging due to the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon. Existing approaches typically fail when several incremental steps are performed or in presence of a distribution shift of the background class. We tackle these issues by recreating no longer available data for the old classes and outlining a content inpainting scheme on the background class. We propose two sources for replay data. The first resorts to a generative adversarial network to sample from the class space of past learning steps. The second relies on web-crawled data to retrieve images containing examples of old classes from online databases. In both scenarios no samples of past steps are stored, thus avoiding privacy concerns. Replay data are then blended with new samples during the incremental steps. Our approach, RECALL, outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

However, existing approaches suffer from several common limitations: (1) they only focus on either object-level or frame-level relational reasoning, and fail to integrate the both; and (2) they neglect to leverage semantic knowledge for relational reasoning. In this work, we propose a Hierarchical VisuAl-Semantic RelatIonal Reasoning (HAIR) framework to address these limitations. Specifically, we present a novel graph memory mechanism to perform relational reasoning, and further develop two types of graph memory: a) visual graph memory that leverages visual information of video for relational reasoning; b) semantic graph memory that is specifically designed to explicitly leverage semantic knowledge contained in the classes and attributes of video objects, and perform relational reasoning in the semantic space. Taking advantage of both graph memory mechanisms, we build a hierarchical framework to enable visual-semantic relational reasoning from object level to frame level. Experiments on four challenging benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework leads to state-of-the-art performance, with fewer parameters and faster inference speed. Besides, our approach also shows superior performance on other video+language task."}

Motivated by scenarios on mobile and mixed reality devices, we propose FastNeRF, the first NeRF-based system capable of rendering high fidelity photorealistic images at 200Hz on a high-end consumer GPU. The core of our method is a graphics-inspired factorization that allows for (i) compactly caching a deep radiance map at each position in space, (ii) efficiently querying that map using ray directions to estimate the pixel values in the rendered image.

EvIntSR-Net bridges the domain gap between event streams and intensity frames and learns to merge a sequence of latent intensity frames in a recurrent updating manner. Experimental results show that EvIntSR-Net can reconstruct SR intensity images with higher dynamic range and fewer blurry artifacts by fusing events with intensity frames for both simulated and real-world data.

In this work, we apply these features, learned from erased images, as segmentation supervision, driving network to study robust representation. In specifically, object regions obtained by CAM techniques are erased on images firstly.

Until now, the community has largely focused on road extraction, where road networks are inferred from scratch from an aerial image. However, given that relatively high-quality maps exist in most parts of the world, in practice, inference approaches must be applied to update existing maps rather than infer new ones. With recent road extraction methods showing high accuracy, we argue that it is time to transition to the more practical map update task, where an existing map is updated by adding, removing, and shifting roads, without introducing errors in parts of the existing map that remain up-to-date. In this paper, we develop a new dataset called MUNO21 for the map update task, and show that it poses several new and interesting research challenges. We evaluate several state-of-the-art road extraction methods on MUNO21, and find that substantial further improvements in accuracy will be needed to realize automatic map update."}

The RGB-D SLAM approach relies heavily on the accuracy of the input depth map. However, refraction and reflection of transparent objects will result in false depth input of RGB-D cameras, which makes the traditional RGB-D SLAM algorithm unable to work correctly in the presence of transparent objects. In this paper, we propose a novel SLAM approach called transfusion that allows transparent object existence and recovery in the video input. Our method is composed of two parts. Transparent Objects Cut Iterative Closest Points (TC-ICP)is first used to recover camera pose, detecting and removing transparent objects from input to reduce the trajectory errors. Then Transparent Objects Reconstruction (TO-Reconstruction) is used to reconstruct the transparent objects and opaque objects separately. The opaque objects are reconstructed with the traditional method, and the transparent objects are reconstructed with the visual hull-based method. To evaluate our algorithm, we construct a new RGB-D SLAM database containing 25 video sequences. Each sequence has at least one transparent object. Experiments show that our approach can work adequately in scenes contain transparent objects while the existing approach can not handle them. Our approach significantly improves the accuracy of the camera trajectory and the quality of environment reconstruction."}

Towards equipping computational agents with similar capabilities, we introduce Pathdreamer, a visual world model for agents navigating in novel indoor environments. Given one or more previous visual observations, Pathdreamer generates plausible high-resolution 360deg visual observations (RGB, semantic segmentation and depth) for viewpoints that have not been visited, in buildings not seen during training. In regions of high uncertainty (e.g. predicting around corners, imagining the contents of an unseen room), Pathdreamer can predict diverse scenes, allowing an agent to sample multiple realistic outcomes for a given trajectory. We demonstrate that Pathdreamer encodes useful and accessible visual, spatial and semantic knowledge about human environments by using it in the downstream task of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Specifically, we show that planning ahead with Pathdreamer brings about half the benefit of looking ahead at actual observations from unobserved parts of the environment. We hope that Pathdreamer will help unlock model-based approaches to challenging embodied navigation tasks such as navigating to specified objects and VLN."}

However, realistic benchmarks and fundamental studies in this line are still missing. To bridge the gap, we present a new online continual object detection benchmark with an egocentric video dataset, Objects Around Krishna (OAK). OAK adopts the KrishnaCAM videos, an ego-centric video stream collected over nine months by a graduate student. OAK provides exhaustive bounding box annotations of 80 video snippets (~17.5 hours) for 105 object categories in outdoor scenes. The emergence of new object categories in our benchmark follows a pattern similar to what a single person might see in their day-to-day life. The dataset also captures the natural distribution shifts as the person travels to different places. These egocentric long running videos provide a realistic playground for continual learning algorithms, especially in online embodied settings. We also introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the model performance and catastrophic forgetting and provide baseline studies for online continual object detection. We believe this benchmark will pose new exciting challenges for learning from non-stationary data in continual learning.

To remedy this, we present DONNA (Distilling Optimal Neural Network Architectures), a novel pipeline for rapid, scalable and diverse NAS, that scales to many user scenarios. DONNA consists of three phases. First, an accuracy predictor is built using blockwise knowledge distillation from a reference model. This predictor enables searching across diverse networks with varying macro-architectural parameters such as layer types and attention mechanisms, as well as across micro-architectural parameters such as block repeats and expansion rates. Second, a rapid evolutionary search finds a set of pareto-optimal architectures for any scenario using the accuracy predictor and on-device measurements. Third, optimal models are quickly finetuned to training-from-scratch accuracy. DONNA is up to 100x faster than MNasNet in finding state-of-the-art architectures on-device. Classifying ImageNet, DONNA architectures are 20% faster than EfficientNet-B0 and MobileNetV2 on a Nvidia V100 GPU and 10% faster with 0.5% higher accuracy than MobileNetV2-1.4x on a Samsung S20 smartphone.

Most existing methods meta-learn all three model components for fast adaptation to a new class. However, given that as few as a single support set image is available, effective model adaption of all three components to the new class is extremely challenging. In this work we propose to simplify the meta-learning task by focusing solely on the simplest component -- the classifier, whilst leaving the encoder and decoder to pre-training. We hypothesize that if we pre-train an off-the-shelf segmentation model over a set of diverse training classes with sufficient annotations, the encoder and decoder can capture rich discriminative features applicable for any unseen classes, rendering the subsequent meta-learning stage unnecessary. For the classifier meta-learning, we introduce a Classifier Weight Transformer (CWT) designed to dynamically adapt the support-set trained classifier's weights to each query image in an inductive way. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks show that despite its simplicity, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives, often by a large margin.

Due to complex interactions among traffic participants, however, it is very hard to achieve accurate prediction for a long horizon. To address this challenge, we propose prediction by anticipation, which views interaction in terms of a latent probabilistic generative process wherein some vehicles move partly in response to the anticipated motion of other vehicles. Under this view, consecutive data frames can be factorized into sequential samples from an action-conditional distribution that effectively generalizes to a wider range of actions and driving situations. Our proposed prediction model, variational Bayesian in nature, is trained to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log-likelihood of this conditional distribution. Evaluations of our approach with prominent AD datasets NGSIM I-80 and Argoverse show significant improvement over current state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization."}

We hypothesize that classification pre-training strives to achieve translation invariance, and consequently ignores the localization aspect of the problem. We propose a new large-scale pre-training strategy for detection, where noisy class labels are available for all images, but not bounding-boxes. In this setting, we augment standard classification pre-training with a new detection-specific pretext task. Motivated by the noise-contrastive learning based self-supervised approaches, we design a task that forces bounding boxes with high-overlap to have similar representations in different views of an image, compared to non-overlapping boxes. We redesign Faster R-CNN modules to perform this task efficiently. Our experimental results show significant improvements over existing weakly-supervised and self-supervised pre-training approaches in both detection accuracy as well as fine-tuning speed."}

We exploit a memory network that stores source (i.e., visual) and target (i.e., audio) modal representations, where source modal representation is what we are given, and target modal representations are what we want to obtain from the memory network. We then construct an associative bridge between source and target memories that considers the interrelationship between the two memories. By learning the interrelationship through the associative bridge, the proposed bridging framework is able to obtain the target modal representations inside the memory network, even with the source modal input only, and it provides rich information for its downstream tasks. We apply the proposed framework to two tasks: lip reading and speech reconstruction from silent video. Through the proposed associative bridge and modality-specific memories, each task knowledge is enriched with the recalled audio context, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also verify that the associative bridge properly relates the source and target memories."}

While pointing out that CAMs only highlight the most discriminative regions of the classes of interest, adversarial erasing (AE) methods have been proposed to further explore the less discriminative regions. In this paper, we review the potential of the pre-trained classifier which is trained on the raw images. We experimentally verify that the ordinary classifier already has the capability to activate the less discriminative regions if the most discriminative regions are erased to some extent. Based on that, we propose a class-specific AE-based framework that fully exploits the potential of an ordinary classifier. Our framework (1) adopts the ordinary classifier to notify the regions to be erased and (2) generates a class-specific mask for erasing by randomly sampling a single specific class to be erased (target class) among the existing classes on the image for obtaining more precise CAMs. Specifically, with the guidance of the ordinary classifier, the proposed CAMs Generation Network (CGNet) is enforced to generate a CAM of the target class while constraining the CAM not to intrude the object regions of the other classes. Along with the pseudo-labels refined from our CAMs, we achieve the state-of-the-art WSSS performance on both PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS-COCO dataset only with image-level supervision.

As the huge time consumption of labeling process on 3D point cloud, domain adaptation for 3D semantic segmentation is of great expectation. With the rise of multi-modal datasets, large amount of 2D images are accessible besides 3D point clouds. In light of this, we propose to further leverage 2D data for 3D domain adaptation by intra and inter domain cross modal learning. As for intra-domain cross modal learning, most existing works sample the dense 2D pixel-wise features into the same size with sparse 3D point-wise features, resulting in the abandon of numerous useful 2D features. To address this problem, we propose Dynamic sparse-to-dense Cross Modal Learning (DsCML) to increase the sufficiency of multi-modality information interaction for domain adaptation. For inter-domain cross modal learning, we further advance Cross Modal Adversarial Learning (CMAL) on 2D and 3D data which contains different semantic content aiming to promote high-level modal complementarity. We evaluate our model under various multi-modality domain adaptation settings including day-to-night, country-to-country and dataset-to-dataset, brings large improvements over both uni-modal and multi-modal domain adaptation methods on all settings."}

Existing ISP designs always adopt a fixed architecture, e.g., several sequential modules connected in a rigid order. Such a fixed ISP architecture may be suboptimal for real-world applications, where camera sensors, scenes and tasks are diverse. In this study, we propose a novel Reconfigurable ISP (ReconfigISP) whose architecture and parameters can be automatically tailored to specific data and tasks. In particular, we implement several ISP modules, and enable backpropagation for each module by training a differentiable proxy, hence allowing us to leverage the popular differentiable neural architecture search and effectively search for the optimal ISP architecture. A proxy tuning mechanism is adopted to maintain the accuracy of proxy networks in all cases. Extensive experiments conducted on image restoration and object detection, with different sensors, light conditions and efficiency constraints, validate the effectiveness of ReconfigISP. Only hundreds of parameters need tuning for every task."}

Ideally, we expect a perfect reconstruction for normal samples and poor reconstruction for abnormal samples. Since the generalizability of deep neural networks is difficult to control, existing models such as autoencoder do not work well. In this work, we interpret the reconstruction of an image as a divide-and-assemble procedure. Surprisingly, by varying the granularity of division on feature maps, we are able to modulate the reconstruction capability of the model for both normal and abnormal samples. That is, finer granularity leads to better reconstruction, while coarser granularity leads to poorer reconstruction. With proper granularity, the gap between the reconstruction error of normal and abnormal samples can be maximized. The divide-and-assemble framework is implemented by embedding a novel multi-scale block-wise memory module into an autoencoder network. Besides, we introduce adversarial learning and explore the semantic latent representation of the discriminator, which improves the detection of subtle anomaly. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the challenging MVTec AD dataset. Remarkably, we improve the vanilla autoencoder model by 10.1% in terms of the AUROC score."}

However, in real-world situations, a difference in the distribution between two datasets, i.e. domain shift, may occur, which becomes a major factor impeding the generalization performance of the model. The research field to solve this problem is called domain generalization, and it alleviates the domain shift problem by extracting domain-invariant features explicitly or implicitly. In recent studies, contrastive learning-based domain generalization approaches have been proposed and achieved high performance. These approaches require sampling of the negative data pair. However, the performance of contrastive learning fundamentally depends on quality and quantity of negative data pairs. To address this issue, we propose a new regularization method for domain generalization based on contrastive learning, called self-supervised contrastive regularization (SelfReg). The proposed approach uses only positive data pairs, thus it resolves various problems caused by negative pair sampling. Moreover, we propose a class-specific domain perturbation layer (CDPL), which makes it possible to effectively apply mixup augmentation even when only positive data pairs are used. The experimental results show that the techniques incorporated by SelfReg contributed to the performance in a compatible manner. In the recent benchmark, DomainBed, the proposed method shows comparable performance to the conventional state-of-the-art alternatives."}

Great progress have been made to date, with the latest models starting to focus on the more practical \"in-the-wild\" setting. However, a salient problem still hinders practical deployment -- prior arts mostly struggle with recognising unseen (or rarely seen) character sequences. In this paper, we put forward a novel framework to specifically tackle this \"unseen\" problem. Our framework is iterative in nature, in that it utilises predicted knowledge of character sequences from a previous iteration, to augment the main network in improving the next prediction. Key to our success is a unique cross-modal variational autoencoder to act as a feedback module, which is trained with the presence of textual error distribution data. This module importantly translate a discrete predicted character space, to a continuous affine transformation parameter space used to condition the visual feature map at next iteration. Experiments on common datasets have shown competitive performance over state-of-the-arts under the conventional setting. Most importantly, under the new disjoint setup where train-test labels are mutually exclusive, ours offers the best performance thus showcasing the capability of generalising onto unseen words."}

Recent state-of-the-arts solve this problem by individually optimizing each local implicit field during inference. Without considering the geometric relationships between local fields, they typically require accurate normals to avoid the sign conflict problem in overlapped regions of local fields, which severely limits their applicability to raw scans where surface normals could be unavailable. Although SAL breaks this limitation via sign-agnostic learning, further works still need to explore how to extend this technique for local shape modeling. To this end, we propose to learn implicit surface reconstruction by sign-agnostic optimization of convolutional occupancy networks, to simultaneously achieve advanced scalability to large-scale scenes, generality to novel shapes, and applicability to raw scans in a unified framework. Concretely, we achieve this goal by a simple yet effective design, which further optimizes the pre-trained occupancy prediction networks with an unsigned cross-entropy loss during inference. The learning of occupancy fields is conditioned on convolutional features from an hourglass network architecture. Extensive experimental comparisons with previous state-of-the-arts on both object-level and scene-level datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy of our approach for surface reconstruction from un-orientated point clouds.

Towards this goal, we introduce a reinforcement learning approach that trains movement policies controlling the agent's camera and microphone placement over time, guided by the improvement in predicted audio separation quality. We demonstrate our approach in scenarios motivated by both augmented reality (system is already co-located with the target object) and mobile robotics (agent begins arbitrarily far from the target object). Using state-of-the-art realistic audio-visual simulations in 3D environments, we demonstrate our model's ability to find minimal movement sequences with maximal payoff for audio source separation.

Main-stream methods predict the missing shapes by decoding a global feature learned from the input point cloud, which often leads to deficient results in preserving topology consistency and surface details. In this work, we present ME-PCN, a point completion network that leverages `emptiness' in 3D shape space. Given a single depth scan, previous methods often encode the occupied partial shapes while ignoring the empty regions (e.g. holes) in depth maps. In contrast, we argue that these `emptiness' clues indicate shape boundaries that can be used to improve topology representation and detail granularity on surfaces. Specifically, our ME-PCN encodes both the occupied point cloud and the neighboring `empty points'. It estimates coarse-grained but complete and reasonable surface points in the first stage, followed by a refinement stage to produce fine-grained surface details. Comprehensive experiments verify that our ME-PCN presents better qualitative and quantitative performance against the state-of-the-art.

In these methods, however, the point-pair is only comprised of the center point and its adjacent points in a vicinity, which may bring information loss to the local feature representation. In this paper, we instead connect each point densely with all other points in a local neighborhood to compose the point-pairs. Specifically, we present a simple but effective local feature representation, called sorted Gram matrix(SGM), which is not only invariant to arbitrary rotations, but also models the pair-wise relationship of all the points in a neighborhood. In more detail, we utilize vector inner product to model distance- and angle-information between two points, and in a local patch it naturally forms a Gram matrix. In order to guarantee permutation invariance, we sort the correlation value in Gram matrix for each point, therefore this geometric feature names sorted Gram matrix. Furthermore, we mathematically prove that the Gram matrix is rotation-invariant and sufficient to model the inherent structure of a point cloud patch. We then use SGM as features in convolution, which can be readily integrated as a drop-in module into any point-based networks.

However, collecting large-scale annotated datasets for this task requires complex professional retouching. Instead, we propose a novel Self-Supervised Harmonization framework (SSH) that can be trained using just \"free\"\" natural images without being edited. We reformulate the image harmonization problem from a representation fusion perspective, which separately processes the foreground and background examples, to address the background occlusion issue. This framework design allows for a dual data augmentation method, where diverse [foreground, background, pseudo GT] triplets can be generated by cropping an image with perturbations using 3D color lookup tables (LUTs). In addition, we build a real-world harmonization dataset as carefully created by expert users, for evaluation and benchmarking purposes. Our results show that the proposed self-supervised method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of reference metrics, visual quality, and subject user study. Code and dataset will be publicly available."}

Such attacks can make models perform abnormally on inputs with predefined triggers and still retain state-of-the-art performance on clean data. While backdoor attacks have been thoroughly investigated in the image domain from both attackers' and defenders' sides, an analysis in the frequency domain has been missing thus far. This paper first revisits existing backdoor triggers from a frequency perspective and performs a comprehensive analysis. Our results show that many current backdoor attacks exhibit severe high-frequency artifacts, which persist across different datasets and resolutions. We further demonstrate these high-frequency artifacts enable a simple way to detect existing backdoor triggers at a detection rate of 98.50% without prior knowledge of the attack details and the target model. Acknowledging previous attacks' weaknesses, we propose a practical way to create smooth backdoor triggers without high-frequency artifacts and study their detectability. We show that existing defense works can benefit by incorporating these smooth triggers into their design consideration. Moreover, we show that the detector tuned over stronger smooth triggers can generalize well to unseen weak smooth triggers. In short, our work emphasizes the importance of considering frequency analysis when designing both backdoor attacks and defenses in deep learning."}

Specifically, recent works haveexperimentally shown that the superior performance of theautomated methods stems from increasing the diversity ofaugmented data. However, two factors regard-ing the diversity of augmented data are still missing: 1)the explicit definition (and thus measurement) of diversityand 2) the quantifiable relationship between diversity andits regularization effects. To fill this gap, we propose a di-versity measure called \"Variance Diversity\" and theoreti-cally show that the regularization effect of data augmenta-tion is promised by Variance Diversity. We confirm in exper-iments that the relative gain from automated data augmen-tation in test accuracy of a given model is highly correlatedto Variance Diversity. To improve the search process ofautomated augmentation, an unsupervised sampling-basedframework,DivAug, is designed to directly optimize Vari-ance Diversity and hence strengthen the regularization ef-fect. Without requiring a separate search process, the per-formance gain from DivAug is comparable with state-of-the-art method with better efficiency. Moreover, under thesemi-supervised setting, our framework can further improvethe performance of semi-supervised learning algorithmsbased on RandAugment, making it highly applicable to real-world problems, where labeled data is scarce.

Nevertheless, being oblivious to the underlying geometry, voxel-based methods suffer from ambiguous features on spatially close objects and struggle with handling complex and irregular geometries due to the lack of geodesic information. In view of this, we present Voxel-Mesh Network (VMNet), a novel 3D deep architecture that operates on the voxel and mesh representations leveraging both the Euclidean and geodesic information. Intuitively, the Euclidean information extracted from voxels can offer contextual cues representing interactions between nearby objects, while the geodesic information extracted from meshes can help separate objects that are spatially close but have disconnected surfaces. To incorporate such information from the two domains, we design an intra-domain attentive module for effective feature aggregation and an inter-domain attentive module for adaptive feature fusion. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of VMNet: specifically, on the challenging ScanNet dataset for large-scale segmentation of indoor scenes, it outperforms the state-of-the-art SparseConvNet and MinkowskiNet (74.6% vs 72.5% and 73.6% in mIoU) with a simpler network structure (17M vs 30M and 38M parameters).

Such objects are highly blurred and move over large distances within one video frame. Fast moving objects are associated with a deblurring and matting problem, also called deblatting. We show that the separation of deblatting into consecutive matting and deblurring allows achieving real-time performance, i.e. an order of magnitude speed-up, and thus enabling new classes of application. The proposed method detects fast moving objects as a truncated distance function to the trajectory by learning from synthetic data. For the sharp appearance estimation and accurate trajectory estimation, we propose a matting and fitting network that estimates the blurred appearance without background, followed by an energy minimization based deblurring. The state-of-the-art methods are outperformed in terms of recall, precision, trajectory estimation, and sharp appearance reconstruction. Compared to other methods, such as deblatting, the inference is of several orders of magnitude faster and allows applications such as real-time fast moving object detection and retrieval in large video collections."}

While long-tailed recognition has been extensively studied for image classification tasks, limited effort has been made for video domain. In this paper, we introduce VideoLT, a large-scale long-tailed video recognition dataset, as a step toward real-world video recognition. VideoLT contains 256,218 untrimmed videos, annotated into 1,004 classes with a long-tailed distribution. Through extensive studies, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art methods used for long-tailed image recognition do not perform well in the video domain due to the additional temporal dimension in video data. This motivates us to propose FrameStack, a simple yet effective method for long-tailed video recognition task. In particular, FrameStack performs sampling at the frame-level in order to balance class distributions, and the sampling ratio is dynamically determined using knowledge derived from the network during training. Experimental results demonstrate that FrameStack can improve classification performance without sacrificing overall accuracy. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/17Skye17/VideoLT."}

The most notable difference with previous works is that our method is purely based on the range view representation. Compared with the commonly used voxelized or Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations, the range view representation is more compact and without quantization error. Although there are works adopting it for semantic segmentation, its performance in object detection is largely behind voxelized or BEV counterparts. We first analyze the existing range-view-based methods and find two issues overlooked by previous works: 1) the scale variation between nearby and far away objects; 2) the inconsistency between the 2D range image coordinates used in feature extraction and the 3D Cartesian coordinates used in output. Then we deliberately design three components to address these issues in our RangeDet. We test our RangeDet in the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). Our best model achieves 72.9/75.9/65.8 3D AP on vehicle/pedestrian/cyclist. These results outperform other range-view-based methods by a large margin, and are overall comparable with the state-of-the-art multi-view-based methods.

However, the issue of feature alignment remains as neglected by most existing approaches for simplicity. Direct pixel addition between upsampled and local features leads to feature maps with misaligned contexts that, in turn, translate to mis-classifications in prediction, especially on object boundaries. In this paper, we propose a feature alignment module that learns transformation offsets of pixels to contextually align upsampled higher-level features; and another feature selection module to emphasize the lower-level features with rich spatial details. We then integrate these two modules in a top-down pyramidal architecture and present the Feature-aligned Pyramid Network (FaPN). Extensive experimental evaluations on four dense prediction tasks and four datasets have demonstrated the efficacy of FaPN, yielding an overall improvement of 1.2 - 2.6 points in AP / mIoU over FPN when paired with Faster / Mask R-CNN. In particular, our FaPN achieves the state-of-the-art of 56.7% mIoU on ADE20K when integrated within Mask-Former. The code is available from https://github.com/EMI-Group/FaPN."}

Indeed, without shaped rewards, i.e., with only terminal rewards, present-day Embodied AI results degrade significantly across Embodied AI problems from single-agent Habitat-based PointGoal Navigation (SPL drops from 55 to 0) and two-agent AI2-THOR-based Furniture Moving (success drops from 58% to 1%) to three-agent Google Football-based 3 vs. 1 with Keeper (game score drops from 0.6 to 0.1). As training from shaped rewards doesn't scale to more realistic tasks, the community needs to improve the success of training with terminal rewards. For this we propose GridToPix: 1) train agents with terminal rewards in gridworlds that generically mirror Embodied AI environments, i.e., they are independent of the task; 2) distill the learned policy into agents that reside in complex visual worlds. Despite learning from only terminal rewards with identical models and RL algorithms, GridToPix significantly improves results across tasks: from PointGoal Navigation (SPL improves from 0 to 64) and Furniture Moving (success improves from 1% to 25%) to football gameplay (game score improves from 0.1 to 0.6). GridToPix even helps to improve the results of shaped reward training."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2021", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "HiFT", "Title": "Hierarchical Feature Transformer for Aerial Tracking", "Abstract": "Most existing Siamese-based tracking methods execute the classification and regression of the target object based on the similarity maps. However, they either employ a single map from the last convolutional layer which degrades the localization accuracy in complex scenarios or separately use multiple maps for decision making, introducing intractable computations for aerial mobile platforms. Thus, in this work, we propose an efficient and effective hierarchical feature transformer (HiFT) for aerial tracking. Hierarchical similarity maps generated by multi-level convolutional layers are fed into the feature transformer to achieve the interactive fusion of spatial (shallow layers) and semantics cues (deep layers). Consequently, not only the global contextual information can be raised, facilitating the target search, but also our end-to-end architecture with the transformer can efficiently learn the interdependencies among multi-level features, thereby discovering a tracking-tailored feature space with strong discriminability. Comprehensive evaluations on four aerial benchmarks have proven the effectiveness of HiFT. Real-world tests on the aerial platform have strongly validated its practicability with a real-time speed.

The ViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with fixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers to model their global relation for classification. However, ViT achieves inferior performance to CNNs when trained from scratch on a midsize dataset like ImageNet. We find it is because: 1) the simple tokenization of input images fails to model the important local structure such as edges and lines among neighboring pixels, leading to low training sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone design of ViT leads to limited feature richness for fixed computation budgets and limited training samples. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new Tokens-To-Token Vision Transformer (T2T-ViT), which incorporates 1) a layer-wise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively structurize the image to tokens by recursively aggregating neighboring Tokens into one Token (Tokens-to-Token), such that local structure represented by surrounding tokens can be modeled and tokens length can be reduced; 2) an efficient backbone with a deep-narrow structure for vision transformer motivated by CNN architecture design after empirical study. Notably, T2T-ViT reduces the parameter count and MACs of vanilla ViT by half, while achieving more than 3.0% improvement when trained from scratch on ImageNet. It also outperforms ResNets and achieves comparable performance with MobileNets by directly training on ImageNet. For example, T2T-ViT with comparable size to ResNet50 (21.5M parameters) can achieve 83.3% top1 accuracy in image resolution 384x384 on ImageNet."}

For example, given a drawer, our network predicts that applying a pulling force on the handle opens the drawer. We propose, discuss, and evaluate novel network architectures that given image and depth data, predict the set of actions possible at each pixel, and the regions over articulated parts that are likely to move under the force.

WikiScenes forms a new testbed for multimodal reasoning involving images, text, and 3D geometry. We demonstrate the utility of WikiScenes for learning semantic concepts over images and 3D models.

The key to DiOr is a novel recurrent generation pipeline to sequentially put garments on a person, so that trying on the same garments in different orders will result in different looks. Our system can produce dressing effects not achievable by existing work, including different interactions of garments (e.g., wearing a top tucked into the bottom or over it), as well as layering of multiple garments of the same type (e.g., jacket over shirt over t-shirt). DiOr explicitly encodes the shape and texture of each garment, enabling these elements to be edited separately. Joint training on pose transfer and inpainting helps with detail preservation and coherence of generated garments. Extensive evaluations show that DiOr outperforms other recent methods like ADGAN in terms of output quality, and handles a wide range of editing functions for which there is no direct supervision."}

In this work, we tackle the problem by a new adversarial attack scheme, namely the Nullifying Attack, which cancels the image translation process and proposes a corresponding framework, the Limit-Aware Self-Guiding Gradient Sliding Attack (LaS-GSA) under a black-box setting. In other words, by processing the image with the proposed LaS-GSA before publishing, any image translation functions can be nullified, which prevents the images from malicious manipulations. First, we introduce the limit-aware RGF and gradient sliding mechanism to estimate the gradient that adheres to the adversarial limit, i.e., the pixel value limitations of the adversarial example. We theoretically prove that our model is able to avoid the error caused by the projection operation in both the direction and the length. Then, an effective self-guiding prior is extracted solely from the threat model and the target image to efficiently leverage the prior information and guide the gradient estimation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaS-GSA requires fewer queries to nullify the image translation process with higher success rates than 4 state-of-the-art methods."}

Existing approaches address this by augmenting the dataset with question paraphrases from visual question generation models or adversarial perturbations. These approaches use the combined data to learn an answer classifier by minimizing the standard cross-entropy loss. To more effectively leverage augmented data, we build on the recent success in contrastive learning. We propose a novel training paradigm (ConClaT) that optimizes both cross-entropy and contrastive losses. The contrastive loss encourages representations to be robust to linguistic variations in questions while the cross-entropy loss preserves the discriminative power of representations for answer prediction. We find that optimizing both losses -- either alternately or jointly -- is key to effective training. On the VQA-Rephrasings benchmark, which measures the VQA model's answer consistency across human paraphrases of a question, ConClaT improves Consensus Score by 1.63% over an improved baseline. In addition, on the standard VQA 2.0 benchmark, we improve the VQA accuracy by 0.78% overall. We also show that ConClaT is agnostic to the type of data-augmentation strategy used."}

For the first time, we propose a unified framework that can handle 9DoF object pose tracking for novel rigid object instances as well as per-part pose tracking for articulated objects from known categories. Here the 9DoF pose, comprising 6D pose and 3D size, is equivalent to a 3D amodal bounding box representation with free 6D pose. Given the depth point cloud at the current frame and the estimated pose from the last frame, our novel end-to-end pipeline learns to accurately update the pose. Our pipeline is composed of three modules: 1) a pose canonicalization module that normalizes the pose of the input depth point cloud; 2) RotationNet, a module that directly regresses small interframe delta rotations; and 3) CoordinateNet, a module that predicts the normalized coordinates and segmentation, enabling analytical computation of the 3D size and translation. Leveraging the small pose regime in the pose-canonicalized point clouds, our method integrates the best of both worlds by combining dense coordinate prediction and direct rotation regression, thus yielding an end-to-end differentiable pipeline optimized for 9DoF pose accuracy (without using non-differentiable RANSAC). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on category-level rigid object pose and articulated object pose benchmarks at the fastest FPS  12."}

A main reason for this issue is the absence of any large-scale, standardized vision benchmarks that incorporate relevant tasks and scenarios related to people with disabilities. This lack of representation hinders even preliminary analysis with respect to underlying pose, appearance, and occlusion characteristics of diverse pedestrians. What is the impact of significant occlusion from a wheelchair on instance segmentation quality? How can interaction with mobility aids, e.g., a long and narrow walking cane, be recognized robustly? To begin addressing such questions, we introduce X-World, an accessibility-centered development environment for vision-based autonomous systems. We tackle inherent data scarcity by leveraging a simulation environment to spawn dynamic agents with various mobility aids. The simulation supports generation of ample amounts of finely annotated, multi-modal data in a safe, cheap, and privacy-preserving manner. Our analysis highlights novel challenges introduced by our benchmark and tasks, as well as numerous opportunities for future developments. We further broaden our analysis using a complementary real-world evaluation benchmark of in-situ navigation by pedestrians with disabilities.

We note that the synthetic face attributes include not only explicit ones such as lip motions that have high correlations with speech, but also implicit ones such as head poses and eye blinks that have only weak correlation with the input audio. To model such complicated relationships among different face attributes with input audio, we propose a FACe Implicit Attribute Learning Generative Adversarial Network (FACIAL-GAN), which integrates the phonetics-aware, context-aware, and identity-aware information to synthesize the 3D face animation with realistic motions of lips, head poses, and eye blinks. Then, our Rendering-to-Video network takes the rendered face images and the attention map of eye blinks as input to generate the photo-realistic output video frames.

One of the main challenges is the requirement of storage and processing of vast volumes of (possibly redundant) driving video data. In this paper, we study the problem of data-efficient training of autonomous driving systems.

We study existing convex optimization based solutions and show that they are unable to provide solution with high weightage to loss of selected video frames. We design a novel multi-criteria online subset selection algorithm, TMCOSS, which uses a thresholded concave function of selection variables. Extensive experiments using driving simulator CARLA show that we are able to drop 80% of the frames, while succeeding to complete 100% of the episodes. We also show that TMCOSS improves performance on the crucial affordance 'Relative Angle' during turns, on inclusion of bucket-specific relative angle loss (BL), leading to selection of more frames in those parts. TMCOSS also achieves an 80% reduction in number of training video frames, on real-world videos from the standard BDD and Cityscapes datasets, for the tasks of drivable area segmentation, and semantic segmentation."}

However, existing works often fuse multiple views' representations or handle clustering in a common feature space, which may result in their entanglement especially for visual representations. To address this issue, we present a novel VAE-based multi-view clustering framework (Multi-VAE) by learning disentangled visual representations. Concretely, we define a view-common variable and multiple view-peculiar variables in the generative model. The prior of view-common variable obeys approximately discrete Gumbel Softmax distribution, which is introduced to extract the common cluster factor of multiple views. Meanwhile, the prior of view-peculiar variable follows continuous Gaussian distribution, which is used to represent each view's peculiar visual factors. By controlling the mutual information capacity to disentangle the view-common and view-peculiar representations, continuous visual information of multiple views can be separated so that their common discrete cluster information can be effectively mined. Experimental results demonstrate that Multi-VAE enjoys the disentangled and explainable visual representations, while obtaining superior clustering performance compared with state-of-the-art methods."}

One of the popular solutions is to exploit the temporal information and enhance per-frame representation through aggregating features from neighboring frames. Despite achieving improvements in detection, existing methods focus on the selection of higher-level video frames for aggregation rather than modeling lower-level temporal relations to increase the feature representation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel solution named TF-Blender, which includes three modules: 1) Temporal relation models the relations between the current frame and its neighboring frames to preserve spatial information. 2). Feature adjustment enriches the representation of every neighboring feature map; 3) Feature blender combines outputs from the first two modules and produces stronger features for the later detection tasks. For its simplicity, TF-Blender can be effortlessly plugged into any detection network to improve detection behavior. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet VID and YouTube-VIS benchmarks indicate the performance guarantees of using TF-Blender on recent state-of-the-art methods."}

Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has gained increasing attention for its effectiveness in unsupervised representation learning. The main idea of instance contrastive learning is to match a same instance in different augmented views. However, the relationship between different instances has not been fully explored in previous contrastive methods, especially for instance-level contrastive loss. To address this issue, we propose Inter-instance Contrastive Encoding (ICE) that leverages inter-instance pairwise similarity scores to boost previous class-level contrastive ReID methods. We first use pairwise similarity ranking as one-hot hard pseudo labels for hard instance contrast, which aims at reducing intra-class variance. Then, we use similarity scores as soft pseudo labels to enhance the consistency between augmented and original views, which makes our model more robust to augmentation perturbations.

The proposed model can generate photo-realistic portrait images with accurate movements according to intuitive modifications. Experiments on both direct and indirect editing tasks demonstrate the superiority of this model. Meanwhile, we further extend this model to tackle the audio-driven facial reenactment task by extracting sequential motions from audio inputs. We show that our model can generate coherent videos with convincing movements from only a single reference image and a driving audio stream.

But how to teach them to perform dexterous operations like human hands is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a grasp synthesis framework to make robots grasp and manipulate objects like human beings. We first build a dataset by accurately segmenting the functional areas of the object and annotating semantic touch code for each functional area to guide the dexterous hand to complete the functional grasp and post-grasp manipulation. This dataset contains 18 categories of 129 objects selected from four datasets, and 15 people participated in data annotation. Then we carefully design four loss functions to constrain the network, which successfully generates the functional grasp of dexterous hand under the guidance of semantic touch code. The thorough experiments in synthetic data show our model can robustly generate functional grasp, even for objects that the model has not see before."}

While individual modalities can approximate a solution, accurate predictions can only be achieved by explicitly fusing the audio and visual features and modeling their temporal progression. Despite its inherent muti-modal nature, current methods still focus on modeling and fusing short-term audiovisual features for individual speakers, often at frame level. In this paper we present a novel approach to active speaker detection that directly addresses the multi-modal nature of the problem, and provides a straightforward strategy where independent visual features from potential speakers in the scene are assigned to a previously detected speech event. Our experiments show that, an small graph data structure built from local information, allows to approximate an instantaneous audio-visual assignment problem. Moreover, the temporal extension of this initial graph achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset with a mAP of 88.8%."}

Existing methods mostly employ homogeneous convolution operators to consume the RGB and depth features, ignoring their intrinsic differences. In fact, the RGB values capture the photometric appearance properties in the projected image space, while the depth feature encodes both the shape of a local geometry as well as the base (whereabout) of it in a larger context. Compared with the base, the shape probably is more inherent and has a stronger connection to the semantics, and thus is more critical for segmentation accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we introduce Shape-aware Convolutional layer (ShapeConv) for processing the depth feature, where the depth feature is firstly decomposed into a shape-component and a base-component, next two learnable weights are introduced to cooperate with them independently, and finally a convolution is applied on the re-weighted combination of these two components. ShapeConv is model-agnostic and can be easily integrated into most CNNs to replace vanilla convolutional layers for semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on three challenging indoor RGB-D semantic segmentation benchmarks, i.e., NYU-Dv2(-13,-40), SUN RGB-D, and SID, demonstrate the effectiveness of our ShapeConv when employing it over five popular architectures. Moreover, the performance of CNNs with ShapeConv is boosted without introducing any computation and memory increase in the inference phase. The reason is that the learnt weights for balancing the importance between the shape and base components in ShapeConv become constants in the inference phase, and thus can be fused into the following convolution, resulting in a network that is identical to one with vanilla convolutional layers."}

Deep learning provides a promising solution for automatic medical image analysis and clinical decision support. However, large-scale manually labeled datasets required for training deep neural networks are difficult and expensive to obtain for medical images. The purpose of this work is to develop label-efficient multimodal medical imaging representations by leveraging radiology reports. Specifically, we propose an attention-based framework (GLoRIA) for learning global and local representations by contrasting image sub-regions and words in the paired report. In addition, we propose methods to leverage the learned representations for various downstream medical image recognition tasks with limited labels. Our results demonstrate high-performance and label-efficiency for image-text retrieval, classification (finetuning and zeros-shot settings), and segmentation on different datasets."}

Previous methods usually lack robustness, scalability, or stability for the first process and simply fuse consensus features with image features for the second process. In this paper, we propose a novel consensus-aware dynamic convolution model to explicitly and effectively perform the \"summarize and search\" process. To summarize consensus image features, we first summarize robust features for every single image using an effective pooling method and then aggregate cross-image consensus cues via the self-attention mechanism. By doing this, our model meets the scalability and stability requirements. Next, we generate dynamic kernels from consensus features to encode the summarized consensus knowledge. Two kinds of kernels are generated in a supplementary way to summarize fine-grained image-specific consensus object cues and the coarse group-wise common knowledge, respectively. Then, we can effectively perform object searching by employing dynamic convolution at multiple scales. Besides, a novel and effective data synthesis method is also proposed to train our network. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code and saliency maps are available at https://github.com/nnizhang/CADC."}

However, adapting them to articulated shapes is non-trivial. Existing approaches learn a backward warp field that maps deformed to canonical points. However, this is problematic since the backward warp field is pose dependent and thus requires large amounts of data to learn. To address this, we introduce SNARF, which combines the advantages of linear blend skinning (LBS) for polygonal meshes with those of neural implicit surfaces by learning a forward deformation field without direct supervision. This deformation field is defined in canonical, pose-independent, space, enabling generalization to unseen poses. Learning the deformation field from posed meshes alone is challenging since the correspondences of deformed points are defined implicitly and may not be unique under changes of topology. We propose a forward skinning model that finds all canonical correspondences of any deformed point using iterative root finding. We derive analytical gradients via implicit differentiation, enabling end-to-end training from 3D meshes with bone transformations. Compared to state-of-the-art neural implicit representations, our approach generalizes better to unseen poses while preserving accuracy. We demonstrate our method in challenging scenarios on (clothed) 3D humans in diverse and unseen poses."}

We argue that this stems from the way data is collected. Designing and collecting static datasets of images (or videos) locks us in to specific design choices and limits us to post-hoc analyses. In practice, vision datasets only include specific domains and tasks. This not only makes it necessary and difficult to combine datsets, but leads to scattershot overall coverage that frustrates systemic research into the interaction of tasks, data, models, and learning algorithms. For example, if a model trained for ImageNet classification on ImageNet transfers better to CoCo than does a model trained for Kitti depth estimation--is that due to the difference in tasks or the different training data? We note that one way to do this is to use a comprehensive, standardized scene representation that contains extra information about the scene, and then to use that to create a specific dataset of study. We introduce a platform for doing this. Specifically, we provide a pipeline that takes as input a 3D scans and generates multi-task datasets of mid-level cues. The pipeline exposes complete control over the generation process, is implemented in mostly python, and we provide ecosystem tools such as a Docker and PyTorch dataloaders. We also provide a starter dataset of several recent 3D scan datasets, processed into standard static datasets of mid-level cues. We show that this starter dataset (generated from the annotator pipeline) is reliable; it yields models that provide state-of-the-art performance for several tasks. It yields human-level surface normal estimation performance on OASIS, despite having never seen OASIS data during training. With the proliferation of cheaper 3D sensors (e.g. on the newest iPhone), we anticipate that releasing an automated tool for this processing pipeline will allow the starter set to continue to expand and cover more domains. We examine a few small examples of using this procedure to analyze the relationship of data, tasks, models and learning algorithms, and suggest several exciting directions that are well out of the scope of this paper."}

Despite their efficiency, current graph-based predictors treat all operations equally, resulting in biased topological knowledge of cell architectures. Intuitively, not all operations are equally significant during forwarding propagation when aggregating information from these operations to another operation. To address the above issue, we propose a Hierarchical Operation-adaptive Predictor (HOP) for NAS. HOP contains an operation-adaptive attention module (OAM) to capture the diverse knowledge between operations by learning the relative significance of operations in cell architectures during aggregation over iterations. In addition, a cell-hierarchical gated module (CGM) further refines and enriches the obtained topological knowledge of cell architectures, by integrating cell information from each iteration of OAM. The experimental results compared with state-of-the-art predictors demonstrate the capability of our proposed HOP. In specific, only using 0.1% training data, HOP improves kendall's Tau by 3.45%, N@5 by 20 places on NASBech-101; only using 1% training data, HOP improves kendall's Tau by 2.12%, N@5 by 18 places on NASBench-201, respectively."}

In this work, we present a novel, flexible, and effective transformer-based model for high-quality instance segmentation. The proposed method, Segmenting Objects with TRansformers (SOTR), simplifies the segmentation pipeline, building on an alternative CNN backbone appended with two parallel subtasks: (1) predicting per-instance category via transformer and (2) dynamically generating segmentation mask with the multi-level upsampling module. SOTR can effectively extract lower-level feature representations and capture long-range context dependencies by Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and twin transformer, respectively. Meanwhile, compared with the original transformer, the proposed twin transformer is timeand resource-efficient since only a row and a column attention are involved to encode pixels. Moreover, SOTR is easy to be incorporated with various CNN backbones and transformer model variants to make considerable improvements for the segmentation accuracy and training convergence. Extensive experiments show that our SOTR performs well on the MS COCO dataset and surpasses state-of-the-art instance segmentation approaches. We hope our simple but strong framework could serve as a preferment baseline for instance-level recognition. Our code is available at https://github.com/easton-cau/SOTR."}

To tackle this problem, we propose a unique geometry-guided fusion framework: 1) First, we characterize fusion correspondences with the geodesic curves derived from the mass transport problem, also known as the Monge-Kantorovich problem. Compared with the depth map back-projection methods, the geodesic curves reveal the geometric structures of the local surface. 2) Moving the points along the geodesic curves is the core of our fusion approach, guided by local geometric properties, i.e., Gaussian curvature and mean curvature. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our novel geometry-guided displacement interpolation fully utilizes the meaningful geometric features of the local surface. It makes the reconstruction accuracy and completeness improved. Finally, a significant number of experimental results on real object data verify the superior performance of the proposed method. Our technique achieves the most delicate geometric details on thin objects for which the original depth map back-projection fusion scheme suffers from severe artifacts (See Fig.1)."}

Of particular importance are interactive situations such as merges, unprotected turns, etc., where predicting individual object motion is not sufficient. Joint predictions of multiple objects are required for effective route planning. There has been a critical need for highquality motion data that is rich in both interactions and annotation to develop motion planning models. In this work, we introduce the most diverse interactive motion dataset to our knowledge, and provide specific labels for interacting objects suitable for developing joint prediction models. With over 100,000 scenes, each 20 seconds long at 10 Hz, our new dataset contains more than 570 hours of unique data over 1750 km of roadways. It was collected by mining for interesting interactions between vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists across six cities within the United States. We use a high-accuracy 3D auto-labeling system to generate high quality 3D bounding boxes for each road agent, and provide corresponding high definition 3D maps for each scene. Furthermore, we introduce a new set of metrics that provides a comprehensive evaluation of both single agent and joint agent interaction motion forecasting models. Finally, we provide strong baseline models for individual agent prediction and joint-prediction. We hope that this new large-scale interactive motion dataset will provide new opportunities for advancing motion forecasting models."}

Recent work shows capabilities of transferring local facial features by capitalizing on the disentanglement property of the StyleGAN latent space. RIS improves existing art on the following: 1) Introducing more effective feature disentanglement to allow for challenging transfers (i.e., hair, pose) that were not shown possible in SoTA methods. 2) Eliminating the need for per-image hyperparameter tuning, and for computing a catalog over a large batch of images. 3) Enabling fine-grained face retrieval using disentangled facial features (e.g., eyes). To our best knowledge, this is the first work to retrieve face images at this fine level. 4) Demonstrating robust, natural editing on real images.

We begin by developing a vanilla 1-bit GNN framework that binarizes both the GNN parameters and the graph features. Despite the lightweight architecture, we observed that this vanilla framework suffered from insufficient discriminative power in distinguishing graph topologies, leading to a dramatic drop in performance. This discovery motivates us to devise meta aggregators to improve the expressive power of vanilla binarized GNNs, of which the aggregation schemes can be adaptively changed in a learnable manner based on the binarized features. Towards this end, we propose two dedicated forms of meta neighborhood aggregators, an exclusive meta aggregator termed as Greedy Gumbel Neighborhood Aggregator (GNA), and a diffused meta aggregator termed as Adaptable Hybrid Neighborhood Aggregator (ANA). GNA learns to exclusively pick one single optimal aggregator from a pool of candidates, while ANA learns a hybrid aggregation behavior to simultaneously retain the benefits of several individual aggregators. Furthermore, the proposed meta aggregators may readily serve as a generic plugin module into existing full-precision GNNs. Experiments across various domains demonstrate that the proposed method yields results superior to the state of the art."}

Building on recent progress on still image text replacement, we present extensions that alter text while preserving the appearance and motion characteristics of the original video. Compared to the problem of still image text replacement, our method addresses additional challenges introduced by video, namely effects induced by changing lighting, motion blur, diverse variations in camera-object pose over time, and preservation of temporal consistency. We parse the problem into three steps. First, the text in all frames is normalized to a frontal pose using a spatio-temporal transformer network. Second, the text is replaced in a single reference frame using a state-of-art still-image text replacement method. Finally, the new text is transferred from the reference to remaining frames using a novel learned image transformation network that captures lighting and blur effects in a temporally consistent manner. Results on synthetic and challenging real videos show realistic text transfer, competitive quantitative and qualitative performance, and superior inference speed relative to alternatives. We introduce new synthetic and real-world datasets with paired text objects. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt at deep video text replacement."}

However, most existing methods directly use feature extraction models trained on ImageNet alone, ignoring the cross-dataset bias between ImageNet and GZSL benchmarks. Such a bias inevitably results in poor-quality visual features for GZSL tasks, which potentially limits the recognition performance on both seen and unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective GZSL method, termed feature refinement for generalized zero-shot learning (FREE), to tackle the above problem. FREE employs a feature refinement (FR) module that incorporates semantic-visual mapping into a unified generative model to refine the visual features of seen and unseen class samples. Furthermore, we propose a self-adaptive margin center loss (SAMC-loss) that cooperates with a semantic cycle-consistency loss to guide FR to learn class- and semantically-relevant representations, and concatenate the features in FR to extract the fully refined features. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant performance gain of FREE over current state-of-the-art methods and its baseline.

We address this challenge by introducing Hypersim, a photorealistic synthetic dataset for holistic indoor scene understanding. To create our dataset, we leverage a large repository of synthetic scenes created by professional artists, and we generate 77,400 images of 461 indoor scenes with detailed per-pixel labels and corresponding ground truth geometry. Our dataset: (1) relies exclusively on publicly available 3D assets; (2) includes complete scene geometry, material information, and lighting information for every scene; (3) includes dense per-pixel semantic instance segmentations and complete camera information for every image; and (4) factors every image into diffuse reflectance, diffuse illumination, and a non-diffuse residual term that captures view-dependent lighting effects. We analyze our dataset at the level of scenes, objects, and pixels, and we analyze costs in terms of money, computation time, and annotation effort. Remarkably, we find that it is possible to generate our entire dataset from scratch, for roughly half the cost of training a popular open-source natural language processing model. We also evaluate sim-to-real transfer performance on two real-world scene understanding tasks - semantic segmentation and 3D shape prediction - where we find that pre-training on our dataset significantly improves performance on both tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the most challenging Pix3D test set.

In this paper, we present a novel deep network to solve the generic rolling shutter correction problem with two consecutive frames. Our pipeline is symmetrically designed to predict the global shutter image corresponding to the intermediate time of these two frames, which is difficult for existing methods because it corresponds to a camera pose that differs most from the two frames. First, two time-symmetric dense undistortion flows are estimated by using well-established principles: pyramidal construction, warping, and cost volume processing. Then, both rolling shutter images are warped into a common global shutter one in the feature space, respectively. Finally, a symmetric consistency constraint is constructed in the image decoder to effectively aggregate the contextual cues of two rolling shutter images, thereby recovering the high-quality global shutter image. Extensive experiments with both synthetic and real data from public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art methods."}

Unlike the majority of existing descriptors, rather than capturing local geometry, DWKS captures the deformation around a point within a collection in a multi-scale and informative manner. This, in turn, allows to compute inter-collection correspondences without using landmarks. To this end, we build upon the successful spectral WKS descriptors, but rather than using the Laplace-Beltrami operator, show that a similar construction can be performed on shape difference operators, that capture differences or distortion within a collection. By leveraging the collection information our descriptor facilitates difficult non-rigid shape matching tasks, even in the presence of strong partiality and significant deformations. We demonstrate the utility of our approach across a range of challenging matching problems on both meshes and point clouds.

Crucially, it affords a sparser dependency structure compared to fully autoregressive approaches. Our PixelPyramids yield state-of-the-art results for density estimation on various image datasets, especially for high-resolution data.

Point clouds are sparse, noisy, and contain limited semantic information compared with 2D images. These inherent limitations make the 3D visual grounding problem more challenging. In this study, we propose 2D Semantics Assisted Training (SAT) that utilizes 2D image semantics in the training stage to ease point-cloud-language joint representation learning and assist 3D visual grounding. The main idea is to learn auxiliary alignments between rich, clean 2D object representations and the corresponding objects or mentioned entities in 3D scenes. SAT takes 2D object semantics, i.e., object label, image feature, and 2D geometric feature, as the extra input in training but does not require such inputs during inference. By effectively utilizing 2D semantics in training, our approach boosts the accuracy on the Nr3D dataset from 37.7% to 49.2%, which significantly surpasses the non-SAT baseline with the identical network architecture and inference input.

Such flexibility at human ease, however, introduces abstract renderings that pose unique challenges to computer vision models. In this paper, we propose a purpose-made sketch representation for human sketches. The key intuition is that such representation should be abstract at design, so to accommodate the abstract nature of sketches. This is achieved by interpreting sketch abstraction on two levels: appearance and structure. We abstract sketch structure as a pre-defined coarse-to-fine visual block hierarchy, and average visual features within each block to model appearance abstraction. We then discuss three general strategies on how to exploit feature synergy across different levels of this abstraction hierarchy. The superiority of explicitly abstracting sketch representation is empirically validated on a number of sketch analysis tasks, including sketch recognition, fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval, and generative sketch healing. Our simple design not only yields strong results on all said tasks, but also offers intuitive feature granularity control to tailor for various downstream tasks.

The employment of the GAN paradigm has a twofold objective: 1) allowing the model to recover finer details than standard translation models; 2) reducing the domain shift between synthetic and real data distributions in an unsupervised way. An extensive evaluation, carried out on a public benchmark of synthetic and real images under different illumination conditions, shows that SurfaceNet largely outperforms existing SVBRDF reconstruction methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, SurfaceNet exhibits a re-markable ability in generating high-quality maps from real samples without any supervision at training time."}

We improve standard positional encoding by introducing the concept of Relative Positional Encoding, which integrates spatial information at the feature level and can handle arbitrary image sizes. Furthermore, while self-training is widely used in zero-shot semantic segmentation to generate pseudo-labels, we propose a new knowledge-distillation-inspired self-training strategy, namely Annealed Self-Training, which can automatically assign different importance to pseudo-labels to improve performance. We systematically study the proposed Relative Positional Encoding and Annealed Self-Training in a comprehensive experimental evaluation, and our empirical results confirm the effectiveness of our method on three benchmark datasets."}

This is known as shortcut learning and leads to impaired generalization. In this work, we show that common DNNs also suffer from shortcut learning when predicting only basic visual object factors of variation (FoV) such as shape, color, or texture. We argue that besides shortcut opportunities, generalization opportunities (GO) are also an inherent part of real-world vision data and arise from partial independence between predicted classes and FoVs. We also argue that it is necessary for DNNs to exploit GO to overcome shortcut learning. Our core contribution is to introduce the Diagnostic Vision Benchmark suite DiagViB-6, which includes datasets and metrics to study a network's shortcut vulnerability and generalization capability for six independent FoV. In particular, DiagViB-6 allows controlling the type and degree of SO and GO in a dataset. We benchmark a wide range of popular vision architectures and show that they can exploit GO only to a limited extent."}

The main challenge of this task is the large modality gap between attributes and images. To reduce the gap, we present a new loss for learning cross-modal embeddings in the context of attribute-based person search. We regard a set of attributes as a category of people sharing the same traits. In a joint embedding space of the two modalities, our loss pulls images close to their person categories for modality alignment. More importantly, it pushes apart a pair of person categories by a margin determined adaptively by their semantic distance, where the distance metric is learned end-to-end so that the loss considers importance of each attribute when relating person categories. Our loss guided by the adaptive semantic margin leads to more discriminative and semantically well-arranged distributions of person images. As a consequence, it enables a simple embedding model to achieve state-of-the-art records on public benchmarks without bells and whistles."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2021", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Swin Transformer", "Title": "Hierarchical Vision Transformer Using Shifted Windows", "Abstract": "This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer."}

We introduce a Dynamic Feature Reflecting Network, named DFR-Net, which contains two novel standalone modules: (i) the Appearance-Localization Feature Reflecting module (ALFR) that first separates task-specific features and then self-mutually reflects the reciprocal features; (ii) the Dynamic Intra-Trading module (DIT) that adaptively realigns the training processes of various sub-tasks via a self-learning manner.

Lidar-based methods achieve the best accuracy, but have a large footprint, high cost, and mechanically-limited angular sampling rates, resulting in low spatial resolution at long ranges. Recent approaches using low-cost monocular or stereo cameras promise to overcome these limitations but struggle in low-light or low-contrast regions as they rely on passive CMOS sensors. We propose a novel 3D object detection modality that exploits temporal illumination cues from a low-cost monocular gated imager. We introduce a novel deep detection architecture, Gated3D, that is tailored to temporal illumination cues in gated images. This modality allows us to exploit mature 2D object feature extractors that guide the 3D predictions through a frustum segment estimation. We assess the proposed method experimentally on a 3D detection dataset that includes gated images captured over 10,000 km of driving data. We validate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art monocular and stereo methods, opening up a new sensor modality as an avenue to replace lidar in autonomous driving. https://light.princeton.edu/gated3d"}

However, the acquisition of labeled data is limited by the high cost. To mitigate the reliance on large labeled datasets, active learning (AL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) are frequently adopted. Although current mainstream methods begin to combine SSL and AL (SSL-AL) to excavate the diverse expressions of unlabeled samples, these methods' fully supervised task models are still trained only with labeled data. Besides, these method's SSL-AL frameworks suffer from mismatch problems. Here, we propose a graph-based SSL-AL framework to unleash the SSL task models' power and make an effective SSL-AL interaction. In the framework, SSL leverages graph-based label propagation to deliver virtual labels to unlabeled samples, rendering AL samples' structural distribution and boosting AL. AL finds samples near the clusters' boundary to help SSL perform better label propagation by exploiting adversarial examples. The information exchange in the closed-loop realizes mutual enhancement of SSL and AL. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods against classification and segmentation benchmarks."}

Most recent efforts in visual navigation have typically focused on generalizing to novel target environments with similar appearance and dynamics characteristics. With RobustNav, we find that some standard embodied navigation agents significantly underperform (or fail) in the presence of visual or dynamics corruptions. We systematically analyze the kind of idiosyncrasies that emerge in the behavior of such agents when operating under corruptions. Finally, for visual corruptions in RobustNav, we show that while standard techniques to improve robustness such as data-augmentation and self-supervised adaptation offer some zero-shot resistance and improvements in navigation performance, there is still a long way to go in terms of recovering lost performance relative to clean \"non-corrupt\" settings, warranting more research in this direction.

Most of the previous methods rarely solve the cases that the prohibited items are deliberately hidden in messy objects due to the lack of large-scale datasets, restricted their applications in real-world scenarios. Towards real-world prohibited item detection, we collect a large-scale dataset, named as PIDray, which covers various cases in real-world scenarios for prohibited item detection, especially for deliberately hidden items. With an intensive amount of effort, our dataset contains 12 categories of prohibited items in 47,677 X-ray images with high-quality annotated segmentation masks and bounding boxes. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest prohibited items detection dataset to date. Meanwhile, we design the selective dense attention network (SDANet) to construct a strong baseline, which consists of the dense attention module and the dependency refinement module. The dense attention module formed by the spatial and channel-wise dense attentions, is designed to learn the discriminative features to boost the performance. The dependency refinement module is used to exploit the dependencies of multi-scale features. Extensive experiments conducted on the collected PIDray dataset demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods, especially for detecting the deliberately hidden items."}

In this paper, we propose a video restoration method to automatically remove these contaminants and produce a clean video. Our approach first seeks to detect attention maps that indicate the regions that need to be restored. In order to leverage the corresponding clean pixels from adjacent frames, we propose a flow completion module to hallucinate the flow of the background scene to the attention regions degraded by the contaminants. Guided by the attention maps and completed flows, we propose a recurrent technique to restore the input frame by fetching clean pixels from adjacent frames. Finally, a multi-frame processing stage is used to further process the entire video sequence in order to enforce temporal consistency. The entire network is trained on a synthetic dataset that approximates the physical lighting properties of contaminant artifacts. This new dataset and our novel framework lead to our method that is able to address different contaminants and outperforms competitive restoration approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

Given a pair of textured source and target objects, our method predicts a part-aware affine transformation field that naturally warps the source shape to imitate the overall geometric style of the target. In addition, the texture style of the target is transferred to the warped source object with the help of a multi-view differentiable renderer. Our model, 3DStyleNet, is composed of two sub-networks trained in two stages. First, the geometric style network is trained on a large set of untextured 3D shapes. Second, we jointly optimize our geometric style network and a pre-trained image style transfer network with losses defined over both the geometry and the rendering of the result. Given a small set of high-quality textured objects, our method can create many novel stylized shapes, resulting in effortless 3D content creation and style-ware data augmentation. We showcase our approach qualitatively on 3D content stylization, and provide user studies to validate the quality of our results. In addition, our method can serve as a valuable tool to create 3D data augmentations for computer vision tasks. Extensive quantitative analysis shows that 3DStyleNet outperforms alternative data augmentation techniques for the downstream task of single-image 3D reconstruction."}

This problem is inherently more challenging when the illumination is not a single light source under laboratory conditions but is instead an unconstrained environmental illumination. Though recent work has shown that implicit representations can be used to model the radiance field of an object, most of these techniques only enable view synthesis and not relighting. Additionally, evaluating these radiance fields is resource and time-intensive. We propose a neural reflectance decomposition (NeRD) technique that uses physically-based rendering to decompose the scene into spatially varying BRDF material properties. In contrast to existing techniques, our input images can be captured under different illumination conditions. In addition, we also propose techniques to convert the learned reflectance volume into a relightable textured mesh enabling fast real-time rendering with novel illuminations. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach with experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, where we are able to obtain high-quality relightable 3D assets from image collections.

Recently, graph convolutional network has been proven to be very effective to learn dynamic relations among pose joints, which is helpful for pose prediction. On the other hand, one can abstract a human pose recursively to obtain a set of poses at multiple scales. With the increase of the abstraction level, the motion of the pose becomes more stable, which benefits pose prediction too. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Scale Residual Graph Convolution Network (MSR-GCN) for human pose prediction task in the manner of end-to-end. The GCNs are used to extract features from fine to coarse scale and then from coarse to fine scale. The extracted features at each scale are then combined and decoded to obtain the residuals between the input and target poses. Intermediate supervisions are imposed on all the predicted poses, which enforces the network to learn more representative features. Our proposed approach is evaluated on two standard benchmark datasets, i.e., the Human3.6M dataset and the CMU Mocap dataset.

Afterwards, self-attention is integrated with conditional random fields (CRFs), the core of the network, to make use of the ability of self-attention in capturing the short-range correlations of the features and the ability of CRFs in learning the inter-dependencies of these features. Such a framework can learn not only the spatio-temporal interactions among the actors which are important for detecting complex movements, but also their short- and long-term dependencies across frames. Also, to deal with both local and non-local relationships of the features, a new variant of self-attention is developed by taking into consideration a set of cliques with different temporal localities. Moreover, a contrastive multi-instance learning scheme is considered to broaden the gap between the normal and abnormal instances, resulting in more accurate abnormal discrimination.

The challenging nature of the very problem however dictated a fragmentation of research efforts: Scene Text Recognition (STR) that deals with text in everyday scenes, and Handwriting Text Recognition (HTR) that tackles hand-written text. In this paper, for the first time, we argue for their unification -- we aim for a single model that can compete favourably with two separate state-of-the-art STR and HTR models. We first show that cross-utilisation of STR and HTR models trigger significant performance drops due to differences in their inherent challenges. We then tackle their union by introducing a knowledge distillation (KD) based framework. This however is non-trivial, largely due to the variable-length and sequential nature of text sequences, which renders off-the-shelf KD techniques that mostly work with global fixed length data, inadequate. For that, we propose four distillation losses, all of which are specifically designed to cope with the aforementioned unique characteristics of text recognition. Empirical evidence suggests that our proposed unified model performs at par with individual models, even surpassing them in certain cases. Ablative studies demonstrate that naive baselines such as a two-stage framework, multi-task and domain adaption/generalisation alternatives do not work that well, further authenticating our design."}

Previous methods are either subject to single-modal input or perform supervised image-level product retrieval, thus fail to accommodate real-life scenarios where enormous weakly annotated multi-modal data are present. In this paper, we investigate a more realistic setting that aims to perform weakly-supervised multi-modal instance-level product retrieval among fine-grained product categories. To promote the study of this challenging task, we contribute Product1M, one of the largest multi-modal cosmetic datasets for real-world instance-level retrieval.

However, few GAN models have explicit dimensions to control the semantic attributes represented in a specific layer. This paper proposes EigenGAN which is able to unsupervisedly mine interpretable and controllable dimensions from different generator layers. Specifically, EigenGAN embeds one linear subspace with orthogonal basis into each generator layer. Via generative adversarial training to learn a target distribution, these layer-wise subspaces automatically discover a set of \"eigen-dimensions\" at each layer corresponding to a set of semantic attributes or interpretable variations. By traversing the coefficient of a specific eigen-dimension, the generator can produce samples with continuous changes corresponding to a specific semantic attribute. Taking the human face for example, EigenGAN can discover controllable dimensions for high-level concepts such as pose and gender in the subspace of deep layers, as well as low-level concepts such as hue and color in the subspace of shallow layers.

In particular, the sample-targeted backdoor attack is a new challenge. It targets at one or a few specific samples, called target samples, to misclassify them to a target class. Without a trigger planted in the backdoor model, the existing backdoor detection schemes fail to detect the sample-targeted backdoor as they depend on reverse-engineering the trigger or strong features of the trigger. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to detect and mitigate sample-targeted backdoor attacks. We discover and demonstrate a unique property of the sample-targeted backdoor, which forces a boundary change such that small \"pockets\" are formed around the target sample. Based on this observation, we propose a novel defense mechanism to pinpoint a malicious pocket by \"wrapping\" them into a tight convex hull in the feature space. We design an effective algorithm to search for such a convex hull and remove the backdoor by fine-tuning the model using the identified malicious samples with the corrected label according to the convex hull. The experiments show that the proposed approach is highly efficient for detecting and mitigating a wide range of sample-targeted backdoor attacks."}

Our key contribution is DensePose 3D, a novel parametric model of an articulated mesh, which can be learned in a self-supervised fashion from 2D image annotations only. This is in stark contrast with previous human body reconstruction methods that utilize a parametric model like SMPL pre-trained on a large dataset of 3D body scans that had to be obtained in a controlled environment. DensePose 3D can thus be applied for modelling broad range of articulated categories such as animal species. In an end-to-end fashion, it automatically learns to softly assign each vertex of a category-specific 3D template mesh to one of the rigidly moving latent parts and trains a single-view network predicting rigid motions of the parts to deform the template so that it re-projects correctly to the dense 2D surface annotations of objects (such as DensePose). In order to prevent unrealistic template deformations, we further propose to align the motions of nearby mesh vertices by expressing the part assignment as a function of the smooth eigenfunctions of the Laplace--Beltrami operator computed on the template mesh. Our experiments demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the-art non-rigid structure-from-motion baselines on both synthetic and real data on categories of humans and animals."}

Self-supervised learning (SSL), which leverages unlabeled data only for representation learning, might be a promising way to improve model performance. Existing SSL methods, however, usually rely on the single-centric-object guarantee, which may not be applicable for multi-instance datasets such as street scenes. To alleviate this limitation, we raise two issues to solve: (1) how to define positive samples for cross-view consistency and (2) how to measure similarity in multi-instance circumstances. We first adopt an IoU threshold during random cropping to transfer global-inconsistency to local-consistency. Then, we propose two feature alignment methods to enable 2D feature maps for multi-instance similarity measurement. Additionally, we adopt intra-image clustering with self-attention for further mining intra-image similarity and translation-invariance. Experiments show that, when pre-trained on Waymo dataset, our method called Multi-instance Siamese Network (MultiSiam) remarkably improves generalization ability and achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, including Cityscapes and BDD100K, while existing SSL counterparts like MoCo, MoCo-v2, and BYOL show significant performance drop. By pre-training on SODA10M, a large-scale autonomous driving dataset, MultiSiam exceeds the ImageNet pre-trained MoCo-v2, demonstrating the potential of domain-specific pre-training.

It provides audio-visual cues beyond predetermined normal field of views and displays distinctive spatial relations on a sphere. However, previous benchmark tasks for panoramic videos are still limited to evaluate the semantic understanding of audio-visual relationships or spherical spatial property in surroundings. We propose a novel benchmark named Pano-AVQA as a large-scale grounded audio-visual question answering dataset on panoramic videos. Using 5.4K 360deg video clips harvested online, we collect two types of novel question-answer pairs with bounding-box grounding: spherical spatial relation QAs and audio-visual relation QAs. We train several transformer-based models from Pano-AVQA, where the results suggest that our proposed spherical spatial embeddings and multimodal training objectives fairly contribute to better semantic understanding of the panoramic surroundings on the dataset."}

While end-to-end methods have recently demonstrated promising results at high efficiency, they are still inferior when compared with elaborate PnP/RANSAC-based approaches in terms of pose accuracy. In this work, we address this shortcoming by means of a novel reason-ing about self-occlusion, in order to establish a two-layer representation for 3D objects which considerably enhances the accuracy of end-to-end 6D pose estimation. Our frame-work, named SO-Pose, takes a single RGB image as input and respectively generates 2D-3D correspondences as well as self-occlusion information harnessing a shared encoder and two separate decoders. Both outputs are then fused to directly regress the 6DoF pose parameters. Incorporating cross-layer consistencies that align correspondences, self-occlusion, and 6D pose, we can further improve accuracy and robustness, surpassing or rivaling all other state-of-the-art approaches on various challenging datasets."}

Transformer for video-text learning has attracted increasing attention due to its promising performance. However, existing cross-modal transformer approaches typically suffer from two major limitations: 1) Exploitation of the transformer architecture where different layers have different feature characteristics is limited; 2) End-to-end training mechanism limits negative sample interactions in a mini-batch. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Transformer (HiT) for video-text retrieval. HiT performs Hierarchical Cross-modal Contrastive Matching in both feature-level and semantic-level, achieving multi-view and comprehensive retrieval results. Moreover, inspired by MoCo, we propose Momentum Cross-modal Contrast for cross-modal learning to enable large-scale negative sample interactions on-the-fly, which contributes to the generation of more precise and discriminative representations. Experimental results on the three major Video-Text Retrieval benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of our method."}

Such pairwise functions underpin the effectiveness of non-local layers, but also determine a complexity that scales quadratically with respect to the input size both in space and time. This is a severely limiting factor that practically hinders the applicability of non-local blocks to even moderately sized inputs. Previous works focused on reducing the complexity by modifying the underlying matrix operations, however in this work we aim to retain full expressiveness of non-local layers while keeping complexity linear. We overcome the efficiency limitation of non-local blocks by framing them as special cases of 3rd order polynomial functions. This fact enables us to formulate novel fast Non-Local blocks, capable of reducing the complexity from quadratic to linear with no loss in performance, by replacing any direct computation of pairwise similarities with element-wise multiplications. The proposed method, which we dub as \"Poly-NL\", is competitive with state-of-the-art performance across image recognition, instance segmentation, and face detection tasks, while having considerably less computational overhead."}

However, non-learning based approaches still outperform for scenes with large depth ranges and sparser wide-baseline views, in part due to their PatchMatch optimization over pixelwise estimates of depth, normals, and visibility. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable PatchMatch-based MVS approach that combines advantages of trainable costs and regularizations with pixelwise estimates. To overcome the challenge of the non-differentiable PatchMatch optimization that involves iterative sampling and hard decisions, we use reinforcement learning to minimize expected photometric cost and maximize likelihood of ground truth depth and normals. We incorporate normal estimation by using dilated patch kernels, and propose a recurrent cost regularization that applies beyond frontal plane-sweep algorithms to our pixelwise depth/normal estimates. We evaluate our method on widely used MVS benchmarks, ETH3D and Tanks and Temples (TnT), and compare to other state of the art learning based MVS models. On ETH3D, our method outperforms other recent learning-based approaches and performs comparably on advanced TnT."}

Unlike the traditional pipelines that conduct detection and description separately, ELSD utilizes a shared feature extractor for both detection and description, to provide the essential line features to the higher-level tasks like SLAM and image matching in real time. First, we design a one-stage compact model, and propose to use the mid-point, angle and length as the minimal representation of line segment, which also guarantees the center-symmetry. The non-centerness suppression is proposed to filter out the fragmented line segments caused by lines' intersections. The fine offset prediction is designed to refine the mid-point localization. Second, the line descriptor branch is integrated with the detector branch, and the two branches are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. In the experiments, the proposed ELSD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the Wireframe dataset and YorkUrban dataset, in both accuracy and efficiency. The line description ability of ELSD also outperforms the previous works on the line matching task."}

However, constructed using simple feature correlations, they lack the ability to encapsulate prior, or even non-local, knowledge. This creates artifacts in poorly constrained, ambiguous regions, such as occluded and textureless areas. We propose a separable cost volume module, a drop-in replacement to correlation cost volumes, that uses non-local aggregation layers to exploit global context cues and prior knowledge, in order to disambiguate motions in these regions. Our method leads both the now standard Sintel and KITTI optical flow benchmarks in terms of accuracy, and is also shown to generalize better from synthetic to real data."}

A major share of such images originate from smart phone cameras capable of very high resolution captures. Most of the existing methods either focus on restoration quality by compromising on processing speed and memory requirements or, focus on removing reflections at very low resolutions, there by limiting their practical deploy-ability. We propose a light weight deep learning model for reflection removal using a novel scale space architecture. Our method processes the corrupted image in two stages, a Low Scale Sub-network (LSSNet) to process the lowest scale and a Progressive Inference (PI) stage to process all the higher scales. In order to reduce the computational complexity, the sub-networks in PI stage are designed to be much shallower than LSSNet. Moreover, we employ weight sharing between various scales within the PI stage to limit the model size. This also allows our method to generalize to very high resolutions without explicit retraining. Our method is superior both qualitatively and quantitatively compared to the state of the art methods and at the same time 20x faster with 50x less number of parameters compared to the most recent state-of-the-art algorithm RAGNet. We implemented our method on an android smart phone, where a high resolution 12 MP image is restored in under 5 seconds."}

Crack detection (e.g., from pavement images) is a challenging task due to intensity in-homogeneity, topology complexity, low contrast and noisy background. The overall crack detection accuracy can be significantly affected by the detection performance on fine-grained cracks. In this work, we propose a Crack Transformer network (CrackFormer) for fine-grained crack detection. The CrackFormer is composed of novel attention modules in a SegNet-like encoder-decoder architecture. Specifically, it consists of novel self-attention modules with 1x1 convolutional kernels for efficient contextual information extraction across feature-channels, and efficient positional embedding to capture large receptive field contextual information for long range interactions. It also introduces new scaling-attention modules to combine outputs from the corresponding encoder and decoder blocks to suppress non-semantic features and sharpen semantic cracks. The CrackFormer is trained and evaluated on three classical crack datasets. The experimental results show that CrackFormer achieves ODS values of 0.871, 0.877 and 0.881, respectively, on the three datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."}

Our method takes a semantic block world as input, where each block is assigned a semantic label such as dirt, grass, or water. We represent the world as a continuous volumetric function and train our model to render view-consistent photorealistic images for a user-controlled camera. In the absence of paired ground truth real images for the block world, we devise a training technique based on pseudo-ground truth and adversarial training. This stands in contrast to prior work on neural rendering for view synthesis, which requires ground truth images to estimate scene geometry and view-dependent appearance. In addition to camera trajectory, GANcraft allows user control over both scene semantics and output style. Experimental results with comparison to strong baselines show the effectiveness of GANcraft on this novel task of photorealistic 3D block world synthesis."}

However, existing works are incapable to deliver a continuous and fine-grained editing mode (e.g., editing a slightly smiling face to a big laughing one) with natural interactions with users. In this work, we propose Talk-to-Edit, an interactive facial editing framework that performs fine-grained attribute manipulation through dialog between the user and the system. Our key insight is to model a continual \"\"semantic field\"\" in the GAN latent space. 1) Unlike previous works that regard the editing as traversing straight lines in the latent space, here the fine-grained editing is formulated as finding a curving trajectory that respects fine-grained attribute landscape on the semantic field. 2) The curvature at each step is location-specific and determined by the input image as well as the users' language requests. 3) To engage the users in a meaningful dialog, our system generates language feedback by considering both the user request and the current state of the semantic field. We also contribute CelebA-Dialog, a visual-language facial editing dataset to facilitate large-scale study. Specifically, each image has manually annotated fine-grained attribute annotations as well as template-based textual descriptions in natural language. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of 1) the smoothness of fine-grained editing, 2) the identity/attribute preservation, and 3) the visual photorealism and dialog fluency. Notably, user study validates that our overall system is consistently favored by around 80% of the participants."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2021", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "AgentFormer", "Title": "Agent-Aware Transformers for Socio-Temporal Multi-Agent Forecasting", "Abstract": "Predicting accurate future trajectories of multiple agents is essential for autonomous systems but is challenging due to the complex interaction between agents and the uncertainty in each agent's future behavior. Forecasting multi-agent trajectories requires modeling two key dimensions: (1) time dimension, where we model the influence of past agent states over future states; (2) social dimension, where we model how the state of each agent affects others. Most prior methods model these two dimensions separately, e.g., first using a temporal model to summarize features over time for each agent independently and then modeling the interaction of the summarized features with a social model. This approach is suboptimal since independent feature encoding over either the time or social dimension can result in a loss of information. Instead, we would prefer a method that allows an agent's state at one time to directly affect another agent's state at a future time. To this end, we propose a new Transformer, termed AgentFormer, that simultaneously models the time and social dimensions. The model leverages a sequence representation of multi-agent trajectories by flattening trajectory features across time and agents. Since standard attention operations disregard the agent identity of each element in the sequence, AgentFormer uses a novel agent-aware attention mechanism that preserves agent identities by attending to elements of the same agent differently than elements of other agents. Based on AgentFormer, we propose a stochastic multi-agent trajectory prediction model that can attend to features of any agent at any previous timestep when inferring an agent's future position. The latent intent of all agents is also jointly modeled, allowing the stochasticity in one agent's behavior to affect other agents. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the state of the art on well-established pedestrian and autonomous driving datasets."}

While standard pre-training on a single large dataset (such as ImageNet) can provide a good initial representation for transfer learning tasks, this approach may result in biased representations that impact the success of learning with new multi-domain data (e.g., different artistic styles) via methods like domain adaptation. We propose a novel pre-training approach called Cross-Domain Self-supervision (CDS), which directly employs unlabeled multi-domain data for downstream domain transfer tasks. Our approach uses self-supervision not only within a single domain but also across domains. In-domain instance discrimination is used to learn discriminative features on new data in a domain-adaptive manner, while cross-domain matching is used to learn domain-invariant features. We apply our method as a second pre-training step (after ImageNet pre-training), resulting in a significant target accuracy boost to diverse domain transfer tasks compared to standard one-stage pre-training."}

To narrow this gap, some methods consider knowledge transfer from additional fully-supervised dataset. But these methods do not fully exploit discriminative category information in the fully-supervised dataset, thus causing low mAP. To solve this issue, we propose a novel category transfer framework for weakly supervised object detection. The intuition is to fully leverage both visually-discriminative and semantically-correlated category information in the fully-supervised dataset to enhance the object-classification ability of a weakly-supervised detector. To handle overlapping category transfer, we propose a double-supervision mean teacher to gather common category information and bridge the domain gap between two datasets. To handle non-overlapping category transfer, we propose a semantic graph convolutional network to promote the aggregation of semantic features between correlated categories. Experiments are conducted with Pascal VOC 2007 as the target weakly-supervised dataset and COCO as the source fully-supervised dataset. Our category transfer framework achieves 63.5% mAP and 80.3% CorLoc with 5 overlapping categories between two datasets, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

However, due to occlusions and physical limitations of range sensors, existing methods only handle the visible surface, thus causing discontinuities and incompleteness in the motion field. To this end, we introduce 4DComplete, a novel data-driven approach that estimates the non-rigid motion for the unobserved geometry. 4DComplete takes as input a partial shape and motion observation, extracts 4D time-space embedding, and jointly infers the missing geometry and motion field using a sparse fully-convolutional network. For network training, we constructed a large-scale synthetic dataset called DeformingThings4D, which consists of 1,972 animation sequences spanning 31 different animals or humanoid categories with dense 4D annotation. Experiments show that 4DComplete 1) reconstructs high-resolution volumetric shape and motion field from a partial observation, 2) learns an entangled 4D feature representation that benefits both shape and motion estimation, 3) yields more accurate and natural deformation than classic non-rigid priors such as As-RigidAs-Possible (ARAP) deformation, and 4) generalizes well to unseen objects in real-world sequences."}

The resulting white-box loss provides a simple and fast \"plug-and-play\" module that enables effective label-noise-robust learning in diverse downstream tasks, without requiring a special training procedure or network architecture. The efficacy of our loss is demonstrated on a variety of datasets with both synthetic and real label noise, where we compare favourably to prior work."}

Existing person ReID studies focus on horizontal-view ReID tasks, in which the person images are captured by the cameras from a (nearly) horizontal view. In this work we introduce a new ReID task, bird-view person ReID, which aims at searching for a person in a gallery of horizontal-view images with the query images taken from a bird's-eye view, i.e., an elevated view of an object from above. The task is important because there are a large number of video surveillance cameras capturing persons from such an elevated view at public places. However, it is a challenging task in that the images from the bird view (i) provide limited person appearance information and (ii) have a large discrepancy compared to the persons in the horizontal view. We aim to facilitate the development of person ReID from this line by introducing a large-scale real-world dataset for this task. The proposed dataset, named BV-Person, contains 114k images of 18k identities in which nearly 20k images of 7.4k identities are taken from the bird's-eye view. We further introduce a novel model for this new ReID task. Large-scale experiments are performed to evaluate our model and 11 current state-of-the-art ReID models on BV-Person to establish performance benchmarks from multiple perspectives.

To address the first limitation, which is due to the quadratic computational complexity of the self-attention module in Transformer encoders, we propose a   dynamic encoder  to approximate the Transformer encoder's attention mechanism using a convolution-based dynamic encoder with various attention types. Such an encoder can dynamically adjust attentions based on multiple factors such as scale importance, spatial importance, and representation (i.e., feature dimension) importance. To mitigate the second limitation of learning difficulty, we introduce a   dynamic decoder  by replacing the cross-attention module with a ROI-based dynamic attention in the Transformer decoder. Such a decoder effectively assists Transformers to focus on region of interests from a coarse-to-fine manner and dramatically lowers the learning difficulty, leading to a much faster convergence with fewer training epochs. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate our advantages. Our Dynamic DETR significantly reduces the training epochs (by  \\bf 14x  ), yet results in a much better performance (by  \\bf 3.6   on mAP). Meanwhile, in the standard  1x  setup with ResNet-50 backbone, we archive a new state-of-the-art performance that further proves the learning effectiveness of the proposed approach.

However, the best RGBD trackers are extensions of the state-of-the-art deep RGB trackers. They are trained with RGB data and the depth channel is used as a sidekick for subtleties such as occlusion detection. This can be explained by the fact that there are no sufficiently large RGBD datasets to 1) train \"deep depth trackers\" and to 2) challenge RGB trackers with sequences for which the depth cue is essential. This work introduces a new RGBD tracking dataset - DepthTrack - that has twice as many sequences (200) and scene types (40) than in the largest existing dataset, and three times more objects (90). In addition, the average length of the sequences (1473), the number of deformable objects (16) and the number of annotated tracking attributes (15) have been increased.

The XVFI-Net is based on a recursive multi-scale shared structure that consists of two cascaded modules for bidirectional optical flow learning between two input frames (BiOF-I) and for bidirectional optical flow learning from target to input frames (BiOF-T). The optical flows are stably approximated by a complementary flow reversal (CFR) proposed in BiOF-T module. During inference, the BiOF-I module can start at any scale of input while the BiOF-T module only operates at the original input scale so that the inference can be accelerated while maintaining highly accurate VFI performance.

The whole pipeline is significantly simplified by unifying the backbone network and eliminating many hand-crafted components. WOO takes a unified video backbone to simultaneously extract features for actor location and action classification. In addition, we introduce spatial-temporal action embeddings into our framework and design a spatial-temporal fusion module to obtain more discriminative features with richer information, which further boosts the action classification performance.

An explanation of the decision of the classifier needs to both discover and visualize these properties. Here we present StylEx, a method for doing this, by training a generative model to specifically explain multiple attributes that underlie classifier decisions. A natural source for such attributes is the StyleSpace of StyleGAN, which is known to generate semantically meaningful dimensions in the image. However, because standard GAN training is not dependent on the classifier, it may not represent those attributes which are important for the classifier decision, and the dimensions of StyleSpace may represent irrelevant attributes. To overcome this, we propose a training procedure for a StyleGAN, which incorporates the classifier model, in order to learn a classifier-specific StyleSpace. Explanatory attributes are then selected from this space. These can be used to visualize the effect of changing multiple attributes per image, thus providing image-specific explanations. We apply StylEx to multiple domains, including animals, leaves, faces and retinal images. For these, we show how an image can be modified in different ways to change its classifier output. Our results show that the method finds attributes that align well with semantic ones, generate meaningful image-specific explanations, and are human-interpretable as measured in user-studies."}

To address this, we design a multi-scale image quality Transformer (MUSIQ) to process native resolution images with varying sizes and aspect ratios. With a multi-scale image representation, our proposed method can capture image quality at different granularities. Furthermore, a novel hash-based 2D spatial embedding and a scale embedding is proposed to support the positional embedding in the multi-scale representation.

Many works focus on how to design efficient channel attention mechanisms while ignoring a fundamental problem, i.e., channel attention mechanism uses scalar to represent channel, which is difficult due to massive information loss. In this work, we start from a different view and regard the channel representation problem as a compression process using frequency analysis. Based on the frequency analysis, we mathematically prove that the conventional global average pooling is a special case of the feature decomposition in the frequency domain. With the proof, we naturally generalize the compression of the channel attention mechanism in the frequency domain and propose our method with multi-spectral channel attention, termed as FcaNet. FcaNet is simple but effective. We can change a few lines of code in the calculation to implement our method within existing channel attention methods. Moreover, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results compared with other channel attention methods on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.

Recent image sensors can record the brightness of scenes with more than eight-bit precision, available in their RAW-format image. We are interested in making full use of such high-precision information to match extremely low-light scene images that conventional methods cannot handle. For extreme low-light scenes, even if some of their brightness information exists in the RAW format images' low bits, the standard raw image processing fails to utilize them properly. As was recently shown by Chen et al., CNNs can learn to produce images with a natural appearance from such RAW-format images. To consider if and how well we can utilize such information stored in RAW-format images for image matching, we have created a new dataset named MID (matching in the dark). Using it, we experimentally evaluated combinations of eight image-enhancing methods and eleven image matching methods consisting of classical/neural local descriptors and classical/neural initial point-matching methods. The results show the advantage of using the RAW-format images and the strengths and weaknesses of the above component methods. They also imply there is room for further research."}

To reduce the huge annotation burden, we propose a Region-based and Diversity-aware Active Learning (ReDAL), a general framework for many deep learning approaches, aiming to automatically select only informative and diverse sub-scene regions for label acquisition. Observing that only a small portion of annotated regions are sufficient for 3D scene understanding with deep learning, we use softmax entropy, color discontinuity, and structural complexity to measure the information of sub-scene regions. A diversity-aware selection algorithm is also developed to avoid redundant annotations resulting from selecting informative but similar regions in a querying batch. Extensive experiments show that our method highly outperforms previous active learning strategies, and we achieve the performance of 90% fully supervised learning, while less than 15% and 5% annotations are required on S3DIS and SemanticKITTI datasets, respectively."}

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) learn a continuous volumetric representation of a scene through multi-view consistency, and can be rendered from novel viewpoints by ray casting. While NeRF has an impressive ability to reconstruct geometry and fine details given many images, up to 100 for challenging 360 degree scenes, it often finds a degenerate solution to its image reconstruction objective when only a few input views are available. To improve few-shot quality, we propose DietNeRF. We introduce an auxiliary semantic consistency loss that encourages realistic renderings at novel poses. DietNeRF is trained on individual scenes to (1) correctly render given input views from the same pose, and (2) match high-level semantic attributes across different, random poses. Our semantic loss allows us to supervise DietNeRF from arbitrary poses. We extract these semantics using a pre-trained visual encoder such as CLIP, a Vision Transformer trained on hundreds of millions of diverse single-view, 2D photographs mined from the web with natural language supervision. In experiments, DietNeRF improves the perceptual quality of few-shot view synthesis when learned from scratch, can render novel views with as few as one observed image when pre-trained on a multi-view dataset, and produces plausible completions of completely unobserved regions.

Existing methods usually use rectangular anchor boxes or a set of points to represent objects. However, these methods either introduce background noise or miss the continuous appearance information inside the object, and thus cause incorrect detection results. In this paper, we propose a novel anchor-free object detection network, called CrossDet, which uses a set of growing cross lines along horizontal and vertical axes as object representations. An object can be flexibly represented as cross lines in different combinations. It not only can effectively reduce the interference of noise, but also takes into account the continuous object information, which is useful to enhance the discriminability of object features and find the object boundaries. Based on the learned cross lines, we propose a crossline extraction module to adaptively capture features of cross lines. Furthermore, we design a decoupled regression mechanism to regress the localization along the horizontal and vertical directions respectively, which helps to decrease the optimization difficulty because the optimization space is limited to a specific direction. Our method achieves consistently improvement on the PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."}

Thereby, these specifications should be abstract, i.e. allowing easy user interaction, whilst providing enough interface for detailed control. Scene graphs are representations of a scene, composed of objects (nodes) and inter-object relationships (edges), proven to be particularly suited for this task, as they allow for semantic control on the generated content. Previous works tackling this task often rely on synthetic data, and retrieve object meshes, which naturally limits the generation capabilities. To circumvent this issue, we instead propose the first work that directly generates shapes from a scene graph in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we show that the same model supports scene modification, using the respective scene graph as interface. Leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) we train a variational Auto-Encoder on top of the object and edge categories, as well as 3D shapes and scene layouts, allowing latter sampling of new scenes and shapes."}

Such models are appealing, because they can provide human-friendly and comprehensive explanations. However, there is a lack of comparison between existing methods, which is due to a lack of re-usable evaluation frameworks and a scarcity of datasets. In this work, we introduce e-ViL and e-SNLI-VE. e-ViL is a benchmark for explainable vision-language tasks that establishes a unified evaluation framework and provides the first comprehensive comparison of existing approaches that generate NLEs for VL tasks. It spans four models and three datasets and both automatic metrics and human evaluation are used to assess model-generated explanations. e-SNLI-VE is currently the largest existing VL dataset with NLEs (over 430k instances). We also propose a new model that combines UNITER, which learns joint embeddings of images and text, and GPT-2, a pre-trained language model that is well-suited for text generation. It surpasses the previous state of the art by a large margin across all datasets. Code and data are available here: https://github.com/maximek3/e-ViL."}

Due to dynamically increasing number of categories and practical constraint of training on every possible domain, which requires large amounts of data, generalizing to both unseen classes and domains is important. Towards that goal, we propose SnMpNet (Semantic Neighbourhood and Mixture Prediction Network), which incorporates two novel losses to account for the unseen classes and domains encountered during testing. Specifically, we introduce a novel Semantic Neighborhood loss to bridge the knowledge gap between seen and unseen classes and ensure that the latent space embedding of the unseen classes is semantically meaningful with respect to its neighboring classes. We also introduce a mix-up based supervision at image-level as well as semantic-level of the data for training with the Mixture Prediction loss, which helps in efficient retrieval when the query belongs to an unseen domain. These losses are incorporated on the SE-ResNet50 backbone to obtain SnMpNet. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, Sketchy Extended and DomainNet, and thorough comparisons with state-of-the-art justify the effectiveness of the proposed model."}

Our method works on the graph-based representation of multiple observable human-centric modalities in the videos, such as poses and faces. We use an autoencoder network equipped with spatial-temporal graph convolutions to detect human activities and interactions based on these modalities. We train our network to map the activity- and interaction-based latent structural representations of the different modalities to per-frame highlight scores based on the representativeness of the frames. We use these scores to compute which frames to highlight and stitch contiguous frames to produce the excerpts. We train our network on the large-scale AVA-Kinetics action dataset and evaluate it on four benchmark video highlight datasets: DSH, TVSum, PHD^2, and SumMe. We observe a 4-12% improvement in the mean average precision of matching the human-annotated highlights over state-of-the-art methods in these datasets, without requiring any user-provided preferences or dataset-specific fine-tuning."}

Our contribution allows animating any template outfit with arbitrary topology and geometric complexity. Recent works develop models for garment edition, resizing and animation at the same time by leveraging the support body model (encoding garments as body homotopies). This leads to complex engineering solutions that suffer from scalability, applicability and compatibility. By limiting our scope to garment animation only, we are able to propose a simple model that can animate any outfit, independently of its topology, vertex order or connectivity. Our proposed architecture maps outfits to animated 3D models into the standard format for 3D animation (blend weights and blend shapes matrices), automatically providing of compatibility with any graphics engine. We also propose a methodology to complement supervised learning with an unsupervised physically based learning that implicitly solves collisions and enhances cloth quality."}

While generative adversarial networks can learn a distribution over future trajectories, they tend to predict out-of-distribution samples when the distribution of future trajectories is a mixture of multiple, possibly disconnected modes. To address this issue, we propose a multi-generator model for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Each generator specializes in learning a distribution over trajectories routing towards one of the primary modes in the scene, while a second network learns a categorical distribution over these generators, conditioned on the dynamics and scene input. This architecture allows us to effectively sample from specialized generators and to significantly reduce the out-of-distribution samples compared to single generator methods."}

This often leads to failures in crowded scenes with occlusions. We propose a novel solution to overcome the limitations of this fundamental assumption. Our Multi-Instance Pose Network (MIPNet) allows for predicting multiple 2D pose instances within a given bounding box. We introduce a Multi-Instance Modulation Block (MIMB) that can adaptively modulate channel-wise feature responses for each instance and is parameter efficient. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by evaluating on COCO, CrowdPose, and OCHuman datasets. Specifically, we achieve 70.0 AP on CrowdPose and 42.5 AP on OCHuman test sets, a significant improvement of 2.4 AP and 6.5 AP over the prior art, respectively. When using ground truth bounding boxes for inference, MIPNet achieves an improvement of 0.7 AP on COCO, 0.9 AP on CrowdPose, and 9.1 AP on OCHuman validation sets compared to HRNet. Interestingly, when fewer, high confidence bounding boxes are used, HRNet's performance degrades (by 5 AP) on OCHuman, whereas MIPNet maintains a relatively stable performance (drop of 1 AP) for the same inputs."}

This paper proposes an expressive yet compact model for joint object pose and shape optimization, and an associated optimization algorithm to infer an object-level map from multi-view RGB-D camera observations. The model is expressive because it captures the identities, positions, orientations, and shapes of objects in the environment. It is compact because it relies on a low-dimensional latent representation of implicit object shape, allowing onboard storage of large multi-category object maps. Different from other works that rely on a single object representation format, our approach has a bi-level object model that captures both the coarse level scale as well as the fine level shape details. Our approach is evaluated on the large-scale real-world ScanNet dataset and compared against state-of-the-art methods."}

Our reconstructed avatars are animation-ready and highly realistic, in both the visible regions from input views and the unseen regions. While prior work shows great promise of reconstructing animatable clothed humans with various topologies, we observe that there exist fundamental limitations resulting in sub-optimal reconstruction quality. In this paper, we revisit the major steps of image-based avatar reconstruction and address the limitations with ARCH++. First, we introduce an end-to-end point based geometry encoder to better describe the semantics of the underlying 3D human body, in replacement of previous hand-crafted features. Second, in order to address the occupancy ambiguity caused by topological changes of clothed humans in the canonical pose, we propose a co-supervising framework with cross-space consistency to jointly estimate the occupancy in both the posed and canonical spaces. Last, we use image-to-image translation networks to further refine detailed geometry and texture on the reconstructed surface, which improves the fidelity and consistency across arbitrary viewpoints. In the experiments, we demonstrate improvements over the state of the art on both public benchmarks and user studies in reconstruction quality and realism."}

However, most existing methods are based on gradients or intermediate features, which are not directly involved in the decision-making process of the classifier. In this paper, we propose a slot attention-based classifier called SCOUTER for transparent yet accurate classification. Two major differences from other attention-based methods include: (a) SCOUTER's explanation is involved in the final confidence for each category, offering more intuitive interpretation, and (b) all the categories have their corresponding positive or negative explanation, which tells \"why the image is of a certain category\" or \"why the image is not of a certain category.\" We design a new loss tailored for SCOUTER that controls the model's behavior to switch between positive and negative explanations, as well as the size of explanatory regions. Experimental results show that SCOUTER can give better visual explanations in terms of various metrics while keeping good accuracy on small and medium-sized datasets."}

In contrast to traditional generative learned models which encode the full generative process into a neural network and can struggle with maintaining local details at the scene level, we introduce a new method that directly leverages scene geometry from the training database. First, we learn to synthesize an initial estimate for a 3D scene, constructed by retrieving a top-k set of volumetric chunks from the scene database. These candidates are then refined to a final scene generation with an attention-based refinement that can effectively select the most consistent set of geometry from the candidates and combine them together to create an output scene, facilitating transfer of coherent structures and local detail from train scene geometry. We demonstrate our neural scene reconstruction with a database for the tasks of 3D super-resolution and surface reconstruction from sparse point clouds, showing that our approach enables generation of more coherent, accurate 3D scenes, improving on average by over 8% in IoU over state-of-the-art scene reconstruction."}

However, the occlusion is still a common and challenging problem for recent ReID methods. Several mainstream methods utilize extra cues (e.g., human pose information) to distinguish human parts from obstacles to alleviate the occlusion problem. Although achieving inspiring progress, these methods severely rely on the fine-grained extra cues, and are sensitive to the estimation error in the extra cues. In this paper, we show that existing methods may degrade if the extra information is sparse or noisy. Thus we propose a simple yet effective method that is robust to sparse and noisy pose information. This is achieved by discretizing pose information to the visibility label of body parts, so as to suppress the influence of occluded regions. We show in our experiments that leveraging pose information in this way is more effective and robust. Besides, our method can be embedded into most person ReID models easily. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model on common occluded person ReID datasets."}

We identify that the long-tail distribution of visual concepts and unequal importance of reasoning steps in real data are the two key obstacles that limit the models' real-world potentials. To address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm, Calibrating Concepts and Operations (CCO), which enables neural symbolic models to capture underlying data characteristics and to reason with hierarchical importance. Specifically, we introduce an executor with learnable concept embedding magnitudes for handling distribution imbalance, and an operation calibrator for highlighting important operations and suppressing redundant ones. Our experiments show CCO substantially boosts the performance of neural symbolic methods on real images. By evaluating models on the real world dataset GQA, CCO helps the neural symbolic method NSCL outperforms its vanilla counterpart by 9.1% (from 47.0% to 56.1%); this result also largely reduces the performance gap between symbolic and non-symbolic methods.

Specifically, we demonstrate that positional information is encoded based on the ordering of the channel dimensions, while semantic information is largely not. Following this demonstration, we show the real world impact of these findings by applying them to two applications. First, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and loss function which improves the translation invariance of a CNN's output. Second, we propose a method to efficiently determine which channels in the latent representation are responsible for (i) encoding overall position information or (ii) region-specific positions. We first show that semantic segmentation has a significant reliance on the overall position channels to make predictions. We then show for the first time that it is possible to perform a `region-specific' attack, and degrade a network's performance in a particular part of the input. We believe our findings and demonstrated applications will benefit research areas concerned with understanding the characteristics of CNNs."}

This is accomplished through two primary modifications: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding, and a convolutional Trasnsformer block leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes introduce desirable properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the ViT architecture (i.e. shift, scale, and distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of Transformers (i.e. dynamic attention, global context, and better generalization). We validate CvT by conducting extensive experiments, showing that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transformers and ResNets on ImageNet-1k, with less parameters and lower FLOPs. In addition, performance gains are maintained when pretrained on larger datasets (e.g. ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks.

Importantly, in order to capture both local and global priors, and to let our model relate between image regions using the most relevant among said priors, we realize our network using a transformer. At inference time, we apply our correspondence network by recursively zooming in around the estimates, yielding a multi-scale pipeline able to provide highly-accurate correspondences.

Decentralized momentum SGD (DmSGD), in which each node averages only with its neighbors, is more communication efficient than vanilla Parallel momentum SGD that incurs global average across all computing nodes. On the other hand, the large-batch training has been demonstrated critical to achieve runtime speedup. This motivates us to investigate how DmSGD performs in the large-batch scenario.  In this work, we find the momentum term can amplify the inconsistency bias in DmSGD. Such bias becomes more evident as batch-size grows large and hence results in severe performance degradation. We next propose DecentLaM, a novel decentralized large-batch momentum SGD to remove the momentum-incurred bias. The convergence rate for both strongly convex and non-convex scenarios is established. Our theoretical results justify the superiority of DecentLaM to DmSGD especially in the large-batch scenario. Experimental results on a a variety of computer vision tasks and models show that DecentLaM promises both efficient and high-quality training."}

The most successful approaches to alleviate this forgetting require extensive replay of previously seen data, which is problematic when memory constraints or data legality concerns exist. In this work, we consider the high-impact problem of Data-Free Class-Incremental Learning (DFCIL), where an incremental learning agent must learn new concepts over time without storing generators or training data from past tasks. One approach for DFCIL is to replay synthetic images produced by inverting a frozen copy of the learner's classification model, but we show this approach fails for common class-incremental benchmarks when using standard distillation strategies. We diagnose the cause of this failure and propose a novel incremental distillation strategy for DFCIL, contributing a modified cross-entropy training and importance-weighted feature distillation, and show that our method results in up to a 25.1% increase in final task accuracy (absolute difference) compared to SOTA DFCIL methods for common class-incremental benchmarks.

Most exist attack methods focus on crafting adversarial examples in the digital domain, while only limited works study physical adversarial attack. However, it is more challenging to generate effective adversarial examples in the physical world due to many uncontrollable physical dynamics. Most current physical attack methods aim to generate robust physical adversarial examples by simulating all possible physical dynamics. When attacking new images or new DNN models, they require expensive manually efforts for simulating physical dynamics and considerable time for iteratively optimizing for each image. To tackle these issues, we propose a class-agnostic and model-agnostic physical adversarial attack model (Meta-Attack), which is able to not only generate robust physical adversarial examples by simulating color and shape distortions, but also generalize to attacking novel images and novel DNN models by accessing a few digital and physical images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate the physical attack as a few-shot learning problem. Here, the training task is redefined as the composition of a support set, a query set, and a target DNN model. Under the few- shot setting, we design a novel class-agnostic and model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm to enhance the generalization ability of our method. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets with four challenging experimental settings verify the superior robustness and generalization of our method by comparing to state-of-the-art physical attack methods."}

We address these three challenges with a hybrid algorithm building on the insight from Wronski et al. that aliasing is an ally in this setting, with parameters that can be learned end to end, while retaining the interpretability of classical approaches to inverse problems. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on synthetic and real image bursts, setting a new state of the art on several benchmarks and delivering excellent qualitative results on real raw bursts captured by smartphones and prosumer cameras."}

This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, namely Graph Convolutional Network with Point Refinement (PR-GCN), to simultaneously address the issues above in a unified way. It first introduces the Point Refinement Network (PRN) to polish 3D point clouds, recovering missing parts with noise removed. Subsequently, the Multi-Modal Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (MMF-GCN) is presented to strengthen RGB-D combination, which captures geometry-aware inter-modality correlation through local information propagation in the graph convolutional network. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used benchmarks, and state-of-the-art performance is reached. Besides, it is also shown that the proposed PRN and MMF-GCN modules are well generalized to other frameworks."}

While great progress has been made in detecting generic or individual types of edges, it remains under-explored to comprehensively study all four edge types together. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network solution, RINDNet, to jointly detect all four types of edges. Taking into consideration the distinct attributes of each type of edges and the relationship between them, RINDNet learns effective representations for each of them and works in three stages. In stage I, RINDNet uses a common backbone to extract features shared by all edges. Then in stage II it branches to prepare discriminative features for each edge type by the corresponding decoder. In stage III, an independent decision head for each type aggregates the features from previous stages to predict the initial results. Additionally, an attention module learns attention maps for all types to capture the underlying relations between them, and these maps are combined with initial results to generate the final edge detection results. For training and evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, BSDS-RIND, with all four types of edges carefully annotated. In our experiments, RINDNet yields promising results in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Additional analysis is presented in supplementary material."}

A distinct characteristic in vehicle tracking is that the trajectories of vehicles are fairly smooth in both the world coordinate and the image coordinate. Hence, models that capture motion consistencies are of high necessity. However, tracking with the standalone motion-based trackers is quite challenging because targets could get lost easily due to limited information, detection error and occlusion. Leveraging appearance information to assist object re-identification could resolve this challenge to some extent. However, doing so requires extra computation while appearance information is sensitive to occlusion as well. In this paper, we try to explore the significance of motion patterns for vehicle tracking without appearance information. We propose a novel approach that tackles the association issue for long-term tracking with the exclusive fully-exploited motion information. We address the tracklet embedding issue with the proposed reconstruct-to-embed strategy based on deep graph convolutional neural networks (GCN). Comprehensive experiments on the KITTI-car tracking dataset and UA-Detrac dataset show that the proposed method, though without appearance information, could achieve competitive performance with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers.

Existing solutions either attentively fuse deep style feature into deep content feature without considering feature distributions, or adaptively normalize deep content feature according to the style such that their global statistic information is matched. Although effective, leaving shallow feature unexplored or without locally considering feature statistics, they are prone to suffer from unnatural output with unpleasing local distortions. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Attention Normalization (AdaAttN) module to adaptively perform attentive normalization on per-point basis. Specifically, spatial attention score is learnt from both shallow and deep features of content and style images. Then per-point weighted statistics are calculated by regarding a style feature point as a distribution of attention-weighted output of all style feature points. Finally, the content feature is normalized so that they demonstrate the same local feature statistics as the calculated per-point weighted style feature statistics. Besides, a novel local feature loss is derived based on AdaAttN to enhance local visual quality. We also extend AdaAttN to be ready for video style transfer with slight modifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art arbitrary image/video style transfer. Codes and models will be available."}

Such encoding has two major issues: (a) it makes the face representations susceptible to privacy leakage (b) it appears to contribute to bias in face recognition. However, existing bias mitigation approaches generally require end-to-end training and are unable to achieve high verification accuracy. Therefore, we present a descriptor-based adversarial de-biasing approach called `Protected Attribute Suppression System (PASS)'. PASS can be trained on top of descriptors obtained from any previously trained high-performing network to classify identities and simultaneously reduce encoding of sensitive attributes. This eliminates the need for end-to-end training. As a component of PASS, we present a novel discriminator training strategy that discourages a network from encoding protected attribute information. We show the efficacy of PASS to reduce gender and skintone information in descriptors from SOTA face recognition networks like Arcface. As a result, PASS descriptors outperform existing baselines in reducing gender and skintone bias on the IJB-C dataset, while maintaining a high verification accuracy."}

The RS effect brings tremendous difficulties for the downstream applications. In this paper, we propose to invert the above RS imaging mechanism, i.e., recovering a high framerate GS video from consecutive RS images to achieve RS temporal super-resolution (RSSR). This extremely challenging problem, e.g., recovering 1440 GS images from two 720-height RS images, is far from being solved end-to-end. To address this challenge, we exploit the geometric constraint in the RS camera model, thus achieving geometry-aware inversion. Specifically, we make three contributions in resolving the above difficulties: (i) formulating the bidirectional RS undistortion flows under the constant velocity motion model, (ii) building the connection between the RS undistortion flow and optical flow via a scaling operation, and (iii) developing a mutual conversion scheme between varying RS undistortion flows that correspond to different scanlines. Building upon these formulations, we propose the first RS temporal super-resolution network in a cascaded structure to extract high framerate global shutter video. Our method explores the underlying spatio-temporal geometric relationships within a deep learning framework, where no extra supervision besides the middle-scanline ground truth GS image is needed. Essentially, our method can be very efficient for explicit propagation to generate GS images under any scanline. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data show that our method can produce high-quality GS image sequences with rich details, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."}

Channel pruning is one important compression strategy, and widely used in slimming various DNNs. Previous gate-based or importance-based pruning methods aim to remove channels whose \"importance\" are smallest. However, it remains unclear what criteria the channel importance should be measured on, leading to various channel selection heuristics. Some other sampling-based pruning methods deploy sampling strategy to train sub-nets, which often causes the training instability and the compressed model's degraded performance. In view of the research gaps, we present a new module named Gates with Differentiable Polarization (GDP), inspired by principled optimization ideas. GDP can be plugged before convolutional layers without bells and whistles, to control the on-and-off of each channel or whole layer block. During the training process, the polarization effect will drive a subset of gates to smoothly decrease to exactly zero, while other gates gradually stay away from zero by a large margin. When training terminates, those zero-gated channels can be painlessly removed, while other non-zero gates can be absorbed into the succeeding convolution kernel, causing completely no interruption to training nor damage to the trained model. Experiments conducted over CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show that the proposed GDP algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark DNNs at a broad range of pruning ratios. We also apply GDP to DeepLabV3Plus-ResNet50 on the challenging Pascal VOC segmentation task, whose test performance sees no drop (even slightly improved) with over 60% FLOPs saving."}

Different from previous methods considering the visual and linguistic information in two separate structures, we propose a Visual Language Modeling Network (VisionLAN), which views the visual and linguistic information as a union by directly enduing the vision model with language capability. Specially, we introduce the text recognition of character-wise occluded feature maps in the training stage. Such operation guides the vision model to use not only the visual texture of characters, but also the linguistic information in visual context for recognition when the visual cues are confused (e.g. occlusion, noise, etc.). As the linguistic information is acquired along with visual features without the need of extra language model, VisionLAN significantly improves the speed by 39% and adaptively considers the linguistic information to enhance the visual features for accurate recognition. Furthermore, an Occlusion Scene Text (OST) dataset is proposed to evaluate the performance on the case of missing character-wise visual cues. The state of-the-art results on several benchmarks prove our effectiveness. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/wangyuxin87/VisionLAN."}

The network models 3D geometries as a general radiance field, which takes a set of 2D images with camera poses and intrinsics as input, constructs an internal representation for each point of the 3D space, and then renders the corresponding appearance and geometry of that point viewed from an arbitrary position. The key to our approach is to learn local features for each pixel in 2D images and to then project these features to 3D points, thus yielding general and rich point representations. We additionally integrate an attention mechanism to aggregate pixel features from multiple 2D views, such that visual occlusions are implicitly taken into account. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality and realistic novel views for novel objects, unseen categories and challenging real-world scenes."}

The model is fully differentiable. We train its parameters from a single training drawing of another 3D shape. We show that, in contrast to previous image-based methods, the use of a geometric representation of 3D shape and 2D strokes allows the model to transfer important aspects of shape and texture style while preserving contours. Our method outputs the resulting drawing in a vector representation, enabling richer downstream analysis or editing in interactive applications."}

Local BA over the latest several keyframes plays a crucial role in visual SLAM. Its execution time should be sufficiently short for robust tracking; this is especially critical for embedded systems with a limited computational resource. This study proposes a learning-based method using a graph network that can replace conventional optimization-based BA and works faster. The graph network operates on a graph consisting of the nodes of keyframes and landmarks and the edges of the latter's visibility from the former. The graph network receives the parameters' initial values as inputs and predicts the updates to their optimal values. We design an intermediate representation of inputs inspired by the normal equation of the Levenberg-Marquardt method. We use the sum of reprojection errors as a loss function to train the graph network. The experiments show that the proposed method outputs parameter estimates with slightly inferior accuracy in 1/60-1/10 of time compared with the conventional BA."}

Yet, these object-centric images are not effectively leveraged for improving object detection in scene-centric images. In this paper, we propose Mosaic of Object-centric images as Scene-centric images (MosaicOS), a simple and novel framework that is surprisingly effective at tackling the challenges of long-tailed object detection. Keys to our approach are three-fold: (i) pseudo scene-centric image construction from object-centric images for mitigating domain differences, (ii) high-quality bounding box imputation using the object-centric images' class labels, and (iii) a multi-stage training procedure. On LVIS object detection (and instance segmentation), MosaicOS leads to a massive 60% (and 23%) relative improvement in average precision for rare object categories. We also show that our framework can be compatibly used with other existing approaches to achieve even further gains.

While recent 3D detection research focuses on improving performance within a single domain, our study reveals that the performance of modern detectors can drop drastically cross-domain. In this paper, we investigate unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. On the Waymo Domain Adaptation dataset, we identify the deteriorating point cloud quality as the root cause of the performance drop. To address this issue, we present Semantic Point Generation (SPG), a general approach to enhance the reliability of LiDAR detectors against domain shifts. Specifically, SPG generates semantic points at the predicted foreground regions and faithfully recovers missing parts of the foreground objects, which are caused by phenomena such as occlusions, low reflectance, or weather interference. By merging the semantic points with the original points, we obtain an augmented point cloud, which can be directly consumed by modern LiDAR-based detectors.  To validate the wide applicability of SPG, we experiment with two representative detectors, PointPillars and PV-RCNN.  On the UDA task, SPG significantly improves both detectors across all object categories of interest and at all difficulty levels. SPG can also benefit object detection in the original domain. On the Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI, SPG improves 3D detection results of these two methods across all categories. Combined with PV-RCNN, SPG achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection results on KITTI."}

We observe two key issues in existing works: firstly, lack of an architecture which can exploit the limited amount of coupling in the decoder stage between the two subtasks, namely occlusion boundary extraction and occlusion orientation prediction, and secondly, improper representation of occlusion orientation. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called Occlusion-shared and Path-separated Network (OPNet), which solves the first issue by exploiting rich occlusion cues in shared high-level features and structured spatial information in task-specific low-level features. We then design a simple but effective orthogonal occlusion representation (OOR) to tackle the second issue.

Recent methods involve a two-stage process: i) warping of the garment to align with the model ii) texture fusion of the warped garment and target model to generate the try-on output. Issues arise due to the non-rigid nature of garments and the lack of geometric information about the model or the garment. It often results in improper rendering of granular details. We propose ZFlow, an end-to-end framework, which seeks to alleviate these concerns regarding geometric and textural integrity (such as pose, depth-ordering, skin and neckline reproduction) through a combination of gated aggregation of hierarchical flow estimates termed Gated Appearance Flow, and dense structural priors at various stage of the network. ZFlow achieves state-of-the-art results as observed qualitatively, and on benchmark image quality measures (PSNR, SSIM, and FID scores).

However, the quality of video delivery system greatly depends on the Internet bandwidth. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are utilized to improve the quality of video delivery recently. These methods divide a video into chunks, and stream LR video chunks and corresponding content-aware models to the client. The client runs the inference of models to super-resolve the LR chunks. Consequently, a large number of models are streamed in order to deliver a video. In this paper, we first carefully study the relation between models of different chunks, then we tactfully design a joint training framework along with the Content-aware Feature Modulation (CaFM) layer to compress these models for neural video delivery. With our method, each video chunk only requires less than 1% of original parameters to be streamed, achieving even better SR performance. We conduct extensive experiments across various SR backbones, video time length, and scaling factors to demonstrate the advantages of our method. Besides, our method can be also viewed as a new approach of video coding. Our primary experiments achieve better video quality compared with the commercial H.264 and H.265 standard under the same storage cost, showing the great potential of the proposed method.

This closed-world setting assumes that the list of object categories is available during training and deployment. However, many real-world applications require detecting or segmenting novel objects, i.e., object categories never seen during training. In this paper, we present, UVO (Unidentified Video Objects), a new benchmark for open-world class-agnostic object segmentation in videos. Besides shifting the focus to the open-world setup, UVO is significantly larger, providing approximately 6 times more videos compared with DAVIS, and 7 times more mask (instance) annotations per video compared with YouTube-VO(I)S. UVO is also more challenging as it includes many videos with crowded scenes and complex background motions. We also demonstrated that UVO can be used for other applications, such as object tracking and super-voxel segmentation. We believe that UVO is a versatile testbed for researchers to develop novel approaches for open-world class-agnostic object segmentation, and inspires new research directions towards a more comprehensive video understanding beyond classification and detection."}

Despite more than four decades since the definition of the Photometric Stereo problem, most of the literature has had limited success when global illumination effects such as cast shadows, self-reflections and ambient light come into play, especially for specular surfaces. Recent approaches have leveraged the capabilities of deep learning in conjunction with computer graphics in order to cope with the need of a vast number of training data to invert the image irradiance equation and retrieve the geometry of the object. However, rendering global illumination effects is a slow process which can limit the amount of training data that can be generated. In this work we propose a novel pixel-wise training procedure for normal prediction by replacing the training data (observation maps) of globally rendered images with independent per-pixel generated data. We show that global physical effects can be approximated on the observation map domain and this simplifies and speeds up the data creation procedure. Our network, PX-NET, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other pixelwise methods on synthetic datasets, as well as the DiLiGenT real dataset on both dense and sparse light settings."}

However, existing localization based methods relying on intermediate representations (i.e., density maps or pseudo boxes) serving as learning targets are counter-intuitive and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a purely point-based framework for joint crowd counting and individual localization. For this framework, instead of merely reporting the absolute counting error at image level, we propose a new metric, called density Normalized Average Precision (nAP), to provide more comprehensive and more precise performance evaluation. Moreover, we design an intuitive solution under this framework, which is called Point to Point Network (P2PNet). P2PNet discards superfluous steps and directly predicts a set of point proposals to represent heads in an image, being consistent with the human annotation results. By thorough analysis, we reveal the key step towards implementing such a novel idea is to assign optimal learning targets for these proposals. Therefore, we propose to conduct this crucial association in an one-to-one matching manner using the Hungarian algorithm. The P2PNet not only significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods on popular counting benchmarks, but also achieves promising localization accuracy.

The task of identifying the main speaker (who is properly taking his/her turn of speaking) and the interrupters (who are interrupting or reacting to the main speaker's utterances) remains a challenging task. Although some prior methods have partially addressed this task, there still remain some limitations. Firstly, a direct association of Audio and Visual features may limit the correlations to be extracted due to different modalities. Secondly, the relationship across temporal segments helping to maintain the consistency of localization, separation and conversation contexts is not effectively exploited. Finally, the interactions between speakers that usually contain the tracking and anticipatory decisions about transition to a new speaker is usually ignored. Therefore, this work introduces a new Audio-Visual Transformer approach to the problem of localization and highlighting the main speaker in both audio and visual channels of a multi-speaker conversation video in the wild. The proposed method exploits different types of correlations presented in both visual and audio signals. The temporal audio-visual relationships across spatial-temporal space are anticipated and optimized via the self-attention mechanism in a Transformer structure. Moreover, a newly collected dataset is introduced for the main speaker detection. To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the first studies that is able to automatically localize and highlight the main speaker in both visual and audio channels in multi-speaker conversation videos."}

However, this dataset preparation strategy harms the application of these CNNs in real-world scenarios due to the inherent domain gap between the training and testing data. A popular attempts towards the challenge is unpaired generative adversarial networks, which generate \"real\" LR counterparts from real HR images using image-to-image translation and then perform super-resolution from \"real\" LR->SR. Despite great progress, it is still difficult to synthesize perfect \"real\" LR images for super-resolution. In this paper, we firstly consider the real-world SR problem from the traditional domain adaptation perspective. We propose a novel unpaired SR training framework based on feature distribution alignment, with which we can obtain degradation-indistinguishable feature maps and then map them to HR images. In order to generate better SR images for target LR domain, we introduce several regularization losses to force the aligned feature to locate around the target domain. Our experiments indicate that our SR network obtains the state-of-the-art performance over both blind and unpaired SR methods on diverse datasets."}

Yet the hash is invariant to benign transformations (changes in quality, codecs, sizes, shapes, etc.) experienced by images during online redistribution. Our key contribution is OSCAR-Net (Object-centric Scene Graph Attention for Image Attribution Network); a robust image hashing model inspired by recent successes of Transformers in the visual domain. OSCAR-Net constructs a scene graph representation that attends to fine-grained changes of every object's visual appearance and their spatial relationships.

However, much less effort has been devoted to modeling general articulated objects. Compared to rigid objects, articulated objects have higher degrees of freedom, which makes it hard to generalize to unseen shapes. To deal with the large shape variance, we introduce Articulated Signed Distance Functions (A-SDF) to represent articulated shapes with a disentangled latent space, where we have separate codes for encoding shape and articulation. With this disentangled continuous representation, we demonstrate that we can control the articulation input and animate unseen instances with unseen joint angles. Furthermore, we propose a Test-Time Adaptation inference algorithm to adjust our model during inference. We demonstrate our model generalize well to out-of-distribution and unseen data, e.g., partial point clouds and real-world depth images."}

In this paper we study the use of body-worn electromagnetic (EM) field-based sensing for the task of 3D human pose reconstruction. To this end, we present a method to estimate SMPL parameters from 6-12 EM sensors. We leverage a customized wearable system consisting of wireless EM sensors measuring time-synchronized 6D poses at 120 Hz. To provide accurate poses even with little user instrumentation, we adopt a recently proposed hybrid framework, learned gradient descent (LGD), to iteratively estimate SMPL pose and shape from our input measurements. This allows us to harness powerful pose priors to cope with the idiosyncrasies of the input data and achieve accurate pose estimates. The proposed method uses AMASS to synthesize virtual EM-sensor data and we show that it generalizes well to a newly captured real dataset consisting of a total of 36 minutes of motion from 5 subjects.

Applications range from representation learning, image translation and generative modeling, to the estimation of spatial deformations. Such maps relate feature vectors, or map between feature spaces. Well-behaved maps should be regular, which can be imposed explicitly or may emanate from the data itself. We explore what induces regularity for spatial transformations, e.g., when computing image registrations. Classical optimization-based models compute maps between pairs of samples and rely on an appropriate regularizer for well-posedness. Recent deep learning approaches have attempted to avoid using such regularizers altogether by relying on the sample population instead. We explore if it is possible to obtain spatial regularity using an inverse consistency loss only and elucidate what explains map regularity in such a context. We find that deep networks combined with an inverse consistency loss and randomized off-grid interpolation yield well behaved, approximately diffeomorphic, spatial transformations. Despite the simplicity of this approach, our experiments present compelling evidence, on both synthetic and real data, that regular maps can be obtained without carefully tuned explicit regularizers and competitive registration performance."}

In this work, we propose several ideas for learned video compression which allow for improved performance for the low-latency mode (I- and P-frames only) along with a considerable increase in computational efficiency. In this setting, for natural videos our approach compares favorably across the entire R-D curve under metrics PSNR, MS-SSIM and VMAF against all mainstream video standards (H.264, H.265, AV1) and all ML codecs. At the same time, our approach runs at least 5x faster and has fewer parameters than all ML codecs which report these figures. Our contributions include a flexible-rate framework allowing a single model to cover a large and dense range of bitrates, at a negligible increase in computation and parameter count; an efficient backbone optimized for ML-based codecs; and a novel in-loop flow prediction scheme which leverages prior information towards more efficient compression. We benchmark our method, which we call ELF-VC (Efficient, Learned and Flexible Video Coding) on popular video test sets UVG and MCL-JCV under metrics PSNR, MS-SSIM and VMAF. For example, on UVG under PSNR, it reduces the BD-rate by 44% against H.264, 26% against H.265, 15% against AV1, 35% against the current best ML codec. At the same time, on an NVIDIA Titan V GPU our approach encodes/decodes VGA at 49/91 FPS, HD 720 at 19/35 FPS, and HD 1080 at 10/18 FPS."}

In this paper, we address the problem of unsupervised viewpoint estimation. We formulate this as a self-supervised learning task, where image reconstruction provides the supervision needed to predict the camera viewpoint. Specifically, we make use of pairs of images of the same object at training time, from unknown viewpoints, to self-supervise training by combining the viewpoint information from one image with the appearance information from the other. We demonstrate that using a perspective spatial transformer allows efficient viewpoint learning, outperforming existing unsupervised approaches on synthetic data, and obtains competitive results on the challenging PASCAL3D+ dataset."}

The dataset is collected using programmable hardware in which an event camera consistently moves around a monitor displaying images from ImageNet. N-ImageNet serves as a challenging benchmark for event-based object recognition, due to its large number of classes and samples. We empirically show that pretraining on N-ImageNet improves the performance of event-based classifiers and helps them learn with few labeled data. In addition, we present several variants of N-ImageNet to test the robustness of event-based classifiers under diverse camera trajectories and severe lighting conditions, and propose a novel event representation to alleviate the performance degradation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to quantitatively investigate the consequences caused by various environmental conditions on event-based object recognition algorithms. N-ImageNet and its variants are expected to guide practical implementations for deploying event-based object recognition algorithms in the real world."}

In this work, we present the first generative model of city blocks named BlockPlanner, and showcase its ability to synthesize valid city blocks with varying land lots configurations. We propose a novel vectorized city block representation utilizing a ring topology and a two-tier graph to capture the global and local structures of a city block. Each land lot is abstracted into a vector representation covering both its 3D geometry and land use semantics. Such vectorized representation enables us to deploy a lightweight network to capture the underlying distribution of land lots configuration in a city block. To enforce intrinsic spatial constraints of a valid city block, a set of effective loss functions are imposed to shape rational results. We contribute a pilot city block dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our representation and framework over the state-of-the-art. Notably, our BlockPlanner is also able to edit and manipulate city blocks, enabling several useful applications, e.g., topology refinement and footprint generation."}

Recently, several deep nets have been proposed to solve these steps jointly. We built upon these works and propose PCAM: a neural network whose key element is a pointwise product of cross-attention matrices that permits to mix both low-level geometric and high-level contextual information to find point correspondences. These cross-attention matrices also permits the exchange of context information between the point clouds, at each layer, allowing the network construct better matching features within the overlapping regions. The experiments show that PCAM achieves state-of-the-art results among methods which, like us, solve steps (a) and (b) jointly via deepnets."}

However, with the expanding demand for multi-disease diagnosis in clinical applications, multi-function solutions need to be investigated. Previous works proposed to either exploit different disease labels to conduct transfer learning through fine-tuning, or transfer knowledge across different domains with similar diseases. However, these methods still cannot address the real clinical challenge - a multi-disease model is required but annotations for each disease are not always available. In this paper, we introduce the task of transferring knowledge from single-disease diagnosis (source domain) to enhance multi-disease diagnosis (target domain). A category-invariant cross-domain transfer (CCT) method is proposed to address this single-to-multiple extension. First, for domain-specific task learning, we present a confidence weighted pooling (CWP) to obtain coarse heatmaps for different disease categories. Then, conditioned on these heatmaps, category-invariant feature refinement (CIFR) blocks are proposed to better localize discriminative semantic regions related to the corresponding diseases. The category-invariant characteristic enables transferability from the source domain to the target domain. We validate our method in two popular areas: extending diabetic retinopathy to identifying multiple ocular diseases, and extending glioma identification to the diagnosis of other brain tumors."}

This task is referred to as Active Recognition (AR). Currently, most methods toward AR are implemented under a fixed-category setting, which constrains their applicability in realistic scenarios that need to incrementally learn new classes without retraining from scratch. Further, collecting massive data for novel categories is expensive. To address this demand, in this paper, we propose a unified framework towards Few-sample Lifelong Active Recognition (FLAR), which aims at performing active recognition on progressively arising novel categories that only have few training samples. Three difficulties emerge with FLAR: the lifelong recognition policy learning, the knowledge preservation of old categories, and the lack of training samples. To this end, our approach integrates prototypes, a robust representation for limited training samples, into a reinforcement learning solution, which motivates the agent to move towards views resulting in more discriminative features. Catastrophic forgetting during lifelong learning is then alleviated with knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments across two datasets, respectively for object and scene recognition, demonstrate that even without large training samples, the proposed approach could learn to actively recognize novel categories in a class-incremental behavior."}

While grammar is an essential representation of natural language, it also exists ubiquitously in vision to represent the hierarchical part-whole structure. In this work, we study grounded grammar induction of vision and language in a joint learning framework. Specifically, we present VLGrammar, a method that uses compound probabilistic context-free grammars (compound PCFGs) to induce the language grammar and the image grammar simultaneously. We propose a novel contrastive learning framework to guide the joint learning of both modules. To provide a benchmark for the grounded grammar induction task, we collect a large-scale dataset, PartIt, which contains human-written sentences that describe part-level semantics for 3D objects. Experiments on the PartIt dataset show that VLGrammar outperforms all baselines in image grammar induction and language grammar induction. The learned VLGrammar naturally benefits related downstream tasks. Specifically, it improves the image unsupervised clustering accuracy by 30%, and performs well in image retrieval and text retrieval. Notably, the induced grammar shows superior generalizability by easily generalizing to unseen categories."}

It learns the model from collections of few-shot classification tasks, which is believed to have a key advantage of making the training objective consistent with the testing objective. However, some recent works report that by training for whole-classification, i.e. classification on the whole label-set, it can get comparable or even better embedding than many meta-learning algorithms. The edge between these two lines of works has yet been underexplored, and the effectiveness of meta-learning in few-shot learning remains unclear. In this paper, we explore a simple process: meta-learning over a whole-classification pre-trained model on its evaluation metric. We observe this simple method achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks. Our further analysis shed some light on understanding the trade-offs between the meta-learning objective and the whole-classification objective in few-shot learning."}

In the case of high-resolution point cloud scans, the challenge is to be able to detect both large primitives as well as those explaining the detailed parts. While the classical RANSAC approach requires case-specific parameter tuning, state-of-the-art networks are limited by memory consumption of their backbone modules such as PointNet++, and hence fail to detect the fine-scale primitives. We present Cascaded Primitive Fitting Networks (CPFN) that relies on an adaptive patch sampling network to assemble detection results of global and local primitive detection networks. As a key enabler, we present a merging formulation that dynamically aggregates the primitives across global and local scales. Our evaluation demonstrates that CPFN improves the state-of-the-art SPFN performance by 13-14% on high-resolution point cloud datasets and specifically improves the detection of fine-scale primitives by 20-22%.

There is great interest in building models that are able to learn similar structure, ideally in an unsupervised manner. Learning such structure from complex 3D scenes that include clutter, occlusions, interactions, and camera motion is still an open challenge. We present a model that is able to segment visual scenes from complex 3D environments into distinct objects, learn disentangled representations of individual objects, and form consistent and coherent predictions of future frames, in a fully unsupervised manner. Our model (named PARTS) builds on recent approaches that utilize iterative amortized inference and transition dynamics for deep generative models. We achieve dramatic improvements in performance by introducing several novel contributions. We introduce a recurrent slot-attention like encoder which allows for top-down influence during inference. Unlike prior work, we eschew using an auto-regressive prior when modeling image sequences, and demonstrate that a fixed frame-independent prior is superior for the purpose of scene segmentation and representation learning. We demonstrate our model's success on three different video datasets (the popular benchmark CLEVRER; a simulated 3D Playroom environment; and a real-world Robotics Arm dataset). Finally, we analyze the contributions of the various model components and the representations learned by the model."}

However, recently several works raise the security issues of 3D deep models. Although most of them consider adversarial attacks, we identify that backdoor attack is indeed a more serious threat to 3D deep learning systems but remains unexplored. We present the backdoor attacks in 3D point cloud with a unified framework that exploits the unique properties of 3D data and networks. In particular, we design two attack approaches on point cloud: the poison-label backdoor attack (PointPBA) and the clean-label backdoor attack (PointCBA). The first one is straightforward and effective in practice, while the latter is more sophisticated assuming there are certain data inspections. The attack algorithms are mainly motivated and developed by 1) the recent discovery of 3D adversarial samples suggesting the vulnerability of deep models under spatial transformation; 2) the proposed feature disentanglement technique that manipulates the feature of the data through optimization methods and its potential to embed a new task. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of the PointPBA with over 95% success rate across various 3D datasets and models, and the more stealthy PointCBA with around 50% success rate. Our proposed backdoor attack in 3D point cloud is expected to perform as a baseline for improving the robustness of 3D deep models."}

This has mostly addressed the design of architectures, typically by adding parameters and increasing model complexity. However, visual relation learning is a long-tailed problem, due to the combinatorial nature of joint reasoning about groups of objects. Increasing model complexity is, in general, ill-suited for long-tailed problems due to their tendency to overfit. In this paper, we explore an alternative hypothesis, denoted the Devil is in the Tails. Under this hypothesis, better performance is achieved by keeping the model simple but improving its ability to cope with long-tailed distributions. To test this hypothesis, we devise a new approach for training visual relationships models, which is inspired by state-of-the-art long-tailed recognition literature. This is based on an iterative decoupled training scheme, denoted Decoupled Training for Devil in the Tails (DT2). DT2 employs a novel sampling approach, Alternating Class-Balanced Sampling (ACBS), to capture the interplay between the long-tailed entity and predicate distributions of visual relations. Results show that, with an extremely simple architecture, DT2-ACBS significantly outperforms much more complex state-of-the-art methods on scene graph generation tasks. This suggests that the development of sophisticated models must be considered in tandem with the long-tailed nature of the problem."}

We propose a novel approach named T-SVDNet to address the task of Multi-source Domain Adaptation (MDA), which is featured by incorporating Tensor Singular Value Decomposition (T-SVD) into a neural network's training pipeline. Overall, high-order correlations among multiple domains are fully explored so as to better bridge the domain gap in this work. Specifically, we impose Tensor-Low-Rank (TLR) constraint on the tensor obtained by stacking up a group of prototypical similarity matrices, aiming at capturing consistent data structure across different domains. Furthermore, to avoid negative transfer brought by noisy source data, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware weighting strategy to adaptively assign weights to different source domains and samples based on the result of uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our model in addressing the task of MDA compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

The dataset covers several building categories, such as houses, churches, skyscrapers, town halls, libraries, and castles. We include a benchmark for evaluating mesh and point cloud labeling. Buildings have more challenging structural complexity compared to objects in existing benchmarks (e.g., ShapeNet, PartNet), thus, we hope that our dataset can nurture the development of algorithms that are able to cope with such large-scale geometric data for both vision and graphics tasks e.g., 3D semantic segmentation, part-based generative models, correspondences, texturing, and analysis of point cloud data acquired from real-world buildings.

However, a counter-intuitive argument is that better teachers do not make better students due to the capacity mismatch. To this end, we present a novel adaptive knowledge distillation method to complement traditional approaches. The proposed method, named as Student Customized Knowledge Distillation (SCKD), examines the capacity mismatch between teacher and student from the perspective of gradient similarity. We formulate the knowledge distillation as a multi-task learning problem so that the teacher transfers knowledge to the student only if the student can benefit from learning such knowledge. We validate our methods on multiple datasets with various teacher-student configurations on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation."}

Existing VSR methods are mostly trained and evaluated on synthetic datasets, where the LR videos are uniformly downsampled from their high-resolution (HR) counterparts by some simple operators (e.g., bicubic downsampling). Such simple synthetic degradation models, however, cannot well describe the complex degradation processes in real-world videos, and thus the trained VSR models become ineffective in real-world applications. As an attempt to bridge the gap, we build a real-world video super-resolution (RealVSR) dataset by capturing paired LR-HR video sequences using the multi-camera system of iPhone 11 Pro Max. Since the LR-HR video pairs are captured by two separate cameras, there are inevitably certain misalignment and luminance/color differences between them. To more robustly train the VSR model and recover more details from the LR inputs, we convert the LR-HR videos into YCbCr space and decompose the luminance channel into a Laplacian pyramid, and then apply different loss functions to different components. Experiments validate that VSR models trained on our RealVSR dataset demonstrate better visual quality than those trained on synthetic datasets under real-world settings. They also exhibit good generalization capability in cross-camera tests. The dataset and code can be found at https://github.com/IanYeung/RealVSR."}

However, existing methods lack the ability to preserve the identity of the source domain. As a result, synthesized images can often over-adapt to the reference domain, losing important structural characteristics and suffering from suboptimal visual quality. To solve these challenges, we propose a novel frequency domain image translation (FDIT) framework, exploiting frequency information for enhancing the image generation process. Our key idea is to decompose the image into low-frequency and high-frequency components, where the high-frequency feature captures object structure akin to the identity. Our training objective facilitates the preservation of frequency information in both pixel space and Fourier spectral space. We broadly evaluate FDIT across five large-scale datasets and multiple tasks including image translation and GAN inversion. Extensive experiments and ablations show that FDIT effectively preserves the identity of the source image, and produces photo-realistic images. FDIT establishes state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average FID score by 5.6% compared to the previous best method."}

Existing methods mainly use contrastive loss with video clips as the instances and learn visual representation by discriminating instances from each other, but they need a careful treatment of negative pairs by either relying on large batch sizes, memory banks, extra modalities or customized mining strategies, which inevitably includes noisy data. In this paper, we observe that the consistency between positive samples is the key to learn robust video representation. Specifically, we propose two tasks to learn appearance and speed consistency, respectively. The appearance consistency task aims to maximize the similarity between two clips of the same video with different playback speeds. The speed consistency task aims to maximize the similarity between two clips with the same playback speed but different appearance information. We show that optimizing the two tasks jointly consistently improves the performance on downstream tasks, e.g., action recognition and video retrieval. Remarkably, for action recognition on the UCF-101 dataset, we achieve 90.8% accuracy without using any extra modalities or negative pairs for unsupervised pre-training, which outperforms the ImageNet supervised pre-trained model.

Recent approaches combine monocular depth networks with inpainting networks to achieve compelling results. A drawback of these techniques is the use of hard depth layering, making them unable to model intricate appearance details such as thin hair-like structures. We present SLIDE, a modular and unified system for single image 3D photography that uses a simple yet effective soft layering strategy to better preserve appearance details in novel views. In addition, we propose a novel depth-aware training strategy for our inpainting module, better suited for the 3D photography task. The resulting SLIDE approach is modular, enabling the use of other components such as segmentation and matting for improved layering. At the same time, SLIDE uses an efficient layered depth formulation that only requires a single forward pass through the component networks to produce high quality 3D photos. Extensive experimental analysis on three view-synthesis datasets, in combination with user studies on in-the-wild image collections, demonstrate superior performance of our technique in comparison to existing strong baselines while being conceptually much simpler.

In this paper, we innovate the widely used high-resolution image segmentation pipeline, in which an ultra-high resolution image is partitioned into regular patches for local segmentation and then the local results are merged into a high-resolution semantic mask. In particular, we introduce a novel locality-aware contextual correlation based segmentation model to process local patches, where the relevance between local patch and its various contexts are jointly and complementarily utilized to handle the semantic regions with large variations. Additionally, we present a contextual semantics refinement network that associates the local segmentation result with its contextual semantics, and thus is endowed with the ability of reducing boundary artifacts and refining mask contours during the generation of final high-resolution mask.

However, current models are stuck in common predicates, e.g., \"on\" and \"at\", rather than informative ones, e.g., \"standing on\" and \"looking at\", resulting in the loss of precise information and overall performance. If a model only uses \"stone on road\" rather than \"blocking\" to describe an image, it is easy to misunderstand the scene. We argue that this phenomenon is caused by two key imbalances between informative predicates and common ones, i.e., semantic space level imbalance and training sample level imbalance. To tackle this problem, we propose BA-SGG, a simple yet effective SGG framework based on balance adjustment but not the conventional distribution fitting. It integrates two components: Semantic Adjustment (SA) and Balanced Predicate Learning (BPL), respectively for adjusting these imbalances. Benefited from the model-agnostic process, our method is easily applied to the state-of-the-art SGG models and significantly improves the SGG performance. Our method achieves 14.3%, 8.0%, and 6.1% higher Mean Recall (mR) than that of the Transformer model at three scene graph generation sub-tasks on Visual Genome, respectively.

A promising research direction is to tackle such quadratic optimization problems over binary variables with quantum annealing, which allows for some problems a more efficient search in the solution space. Unfortunately, enforcing the linear equality constraints in QAPs via a penalty significantly limits the success probability of such methods on currently available quantum hardware. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Q-Match, i.e., a new iterative quantum method for QAPs inspired by the alpha-expansion algorithm, which allows solving problems of an order of magnitude larger than current quantum methods. It implicitly enforces the QAP constraints by updating the current estimates in a cyclic fashion. Further, Q-Match can be applied iteratively, on a subset of well-chosen correspondences, allowing us to scale to real-world problems. Using the latest quantum annealer, the D-Wave Advantage, we evaluate the proposed method on a subset of QAPLIB as well as on isometric shape matching problems from the FAUST dataset."}

In order to mitigate the impact of large modality discrepancy, existing works manually design various two-stream architectures to separately learn modality-specific and modality-sharable representations. Such a manual design routine, however, highly depends on massive experiments and empirical practice, which is time consuming and labor intensive. In this paper, we systematically study the manually designed architectures, and identify that appropriately separating Batch Normalization (BN) layers is the key to bring a great boost towards cross-modality matching. Based on this observation, the essential objective is to find the optimal separation scheme for each BN layer. To this end, we propose a novel method, named Cross-Modality Neural Architecture Search (CM-NAS).

Recent work based on self-training using target pseudolabels has shown promise, but on challenging shifts pseudolabels may be highly unreliable and using them for self-training may lead to error accumulation and domain misalignment. We propose Selective Entropy Optimization via Committee Consistency (SENTRY), a UDA algorithm that judges the reliability of a target instance based on its predictive consistency under a committee of random image transformations. Our algorithm then selectively minimizes predictive entropy to increase confidence on highly consistent target instances, while maximizing predictive entropy to reduce confidence on highly inconsistent ones. In combination with pseudolabel-based approximate target class balancing, our approach leads to significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on 27/31 domain shifts from standard UDA benchmarks as well as benchmarks designed to stress-test adaptation under label distribution shift."}

Localizing forged faces among multiple human faces in unrestricted natural scenes is far more challenging than the traditional deepfake recognition task. To promote these new tasks, we have created the first large-scale dataset posing a high level of challenges that is designed with face-wise rich annotations explicitly for face forgery detection and segmentation, namely OpenForensics. With its rich annotations, our OpenForensics dataset has great potentials for research in both deepfake prevention and general human face detection. We have also developed a suite of benchmarks for these tasks by conducting an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art instance detection and segmentation methods on our newly constructed dataset in various scenarios."}

For image super-resolution (SR), it learns to predict diverse photo-realistic high-resolution (HR) images from the low-resolution (LR) image rather than learning a deterministic mapping. For image rescaling, it achieves high accuracy by jointly modelling the downscaling and upscaling processes. While existing approaches employ specialized techniques for these two tasks, we set out to unify them in a single formulation. In this paper, we propose the hierarchical conditional flow (HCFlow) as a unified framework for image SR and image rescaling. More specifically, HCFlow learns a bijective mapping between HR and LR image pairs by modelling the distribution of the LR image and the rest high-frequency component simultaneously. In particular, the high-frequency component is conditional on the LR image in a hierarchical manner. To further enhance the performance, other losses such as perceptual loss and GAN loss are combined with the commonly used negative log-likelihood loss in training. Extensive experiments on general image SR, face image SR and image rescaling have demonstrated that the proposed HCFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality."}

Ideally, this task should synthesize natural-looking faces across various age groups while maintaining identity. However, most of the existing work has focused on only one of these or is difficult to train while unnatural artifacts still appear. In this work, we propose Re-Aging GAN (RAGAN), a novel single framework considering all the critical factors in age transformation. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art personalized face age transformation by compelling the input identity to perform the self-guidance of the generation process. Specifically, RAGAN can learn the personalized age features by using high-order interactions between given identity and target age. Learned personalized age features are identity information that is recalibrated according to the target age. Hence, such features encompass identity and target age information that provides important clues on how an input identity should be at a certain age. Experimental result shows the lowest FID and KID scores and the highest age recognition accuracy compared to previous methods. The proposed method also demonstrates the visual superiority with fewer artifacts, identity preservation, and natural transformation across various age groups."}

Acquiring LF data with high angular, spatial and temporal resolution poses significant challenges, especially with space constraints preventing bulky optics. At the same time, stereo video capture, now available on many consumer devices, can be interpreted as a sparse LF-capture. We explore the application of small baseline stereo videos for reconstructing high fidelity LF videos. We propose a self-supervised learning-based algorithm for LF video reconstruction from stereo video. The self-supervised LF video reconstruction is guided via the geometric information from the individual stereo pairs and the temporal information from the video sequence. LF estimation is further regularized by a low-rank constraint based on layered LF displays. The proposed self-supervised algorithm facilitates advantages such as post-training fine-tuning on test sequences and variable angular view interpolation and extrapolation. Quantitatively the LF videos show higher fidelity than previously proposed unsupervised approaches for LF reconstruction. We demonstrate our results via LF videos generated from stereo videos acquired from commercially available stereoscopic cameras. Finally, we demonstrate that our reconstructed LF videos allow applications such as post-capture focus control and RoI-based focus tracking for videos."}

Unlike traditional cameras, event cameras have very low latency (microseconds vs milliseconds) very high dynamic range (140dB vs 60 dB), and low power consumption, as they report changes of a scene and not a complete frame. As they re-port per pixel feature-like events and not the whole intensity frame they are immune to motion blur. However, event cameras require movement between the scene and camera to fire events ,i.e., they have no output when the scene is relatively static. Traditional cameras, however, report the whole frame of pixels at once in fixed intervals but have lower dynamic range and are prone to motion blur in case of rapid movements. We get the best from both worlds and use events and intensity images together in our complementary design and estimate dense disparity from this combination. The proposed end-to-end design combines events and images in a sequential manner and correlates them to esti-mate dense depth values. Our various experimental settings in real-world and simulated scenarios exploit the superiority of our method in predicting accurate depth values with fine details. We further extend our method to extreme cases of missing the left or right event or stereo pair and also investigate stereo depth estimation with inconsistent dynamic ranges or event thresholds on the left and right pairs"}

In this paper, we study the structural vulnerability of deep learning-based action recognition models against the adversarial attack using the one frame attack that adds an inconspicuous perturbation to only a single frame of a given video clip. Our analysis shows that the models are highly vulnerable against the one frame attack due to their structural properties. Experiments demonstrate high fooling rates and inconspicuous characteristics of the attack. Furthermore, we show that strong universal one frame perturbations can be obtained under various scenarios. Our work raises the serious issue of adversarial vulnerability of the state-of-the-art action recognition models in various perspectives."}

Meanwhile, neural architecture search methods are surging with an expectation to reduce human efforts. However, whether NAS methods can efficiently and effectively handle diversified search spaces with disparate candidates (e.g. CNNs and transformers) is still an open question. In this work, we present Block-wisely Self-supervised Neural Architecture Search (BossNAS), an unsupervised NAS method that addresses the problem of inaccurate architecture rating caused by large weight-sharing space and biased supervision in previous methods. More specifically, we factorize the search space into blocks and utilize a novel self-supervised training scheme, named ensemble bootstrapping, to train each block separately before searching them as a whole towards the population center. Additionally, we present HyTra search space, a fabric-like hybrid CNN-transformer search space with searchable down-sampling positions. On this challenging search space, our searched model, BossNet-T, achieves up to 82.5% accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing EfficientNet by 2.4% with comparable compute time. Moreover, our method achieves superior architecture rating accuracy with 0.78 and 0.76 Spearman correlation on the canonical MBConv search space with ImageNet and on NATS-Bench size search space with CIFAR-100, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art NAS methods."}

To this end, we propose a method to create a unified dataset for egocentric 3D interaction recognition. Our method produces annotations of the 3D pose of two hands and the 6D pose of the manipulated objects, along with their interaction labels for each frame. Our dataset, called H2O (2 Hands and Objects), provides synchronized multi-view RGB-D images, interaction labels, object classes, ground-truth 3D poses for left & right hands, 6D object poses, ground-truth camera poses, object meshes and scene point clouds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark that enables the study of first-person actions with the use of the pose of both left and right hands manipulating objects and presents an unprecedented level of detail for egocentric 3D interaction recognition. We further propose the method to predict interaction classes by estimating the 3D pose of two hands and the 6D pose of the manipulated objects, jointly from RGB images. Our method models both inter- and intra-dependencies between both hands and objects by learning the topology of a graph convolutional network that predicts interactions. We show that our method facilitated by this dataset establishes a strong baseline for joint hand-object pose estimation and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for first person interaction recognition."}

Progresses in this area, however, are often characterized by complicated methods, heavy computations, and lack of intuitive explanations. To effectively capture different spatial regions occupied by objects from different categories, we propose an embarrassingly simple module, named class-specific residual attention (CSRA). CSRA generates class-specific features for every category by proposing a simple spatial attention score, and then combines it with the class-agnostic average pooling feature. CSRA achieves state-of-the-art results on multilabel recognition, and at the same time is much simpler than them. Furthermore, with only 4 lines of code, CSRA also leads to consistent improvement across many diverse pretrained models and datasets without any extra training. CSRA is both easy to implement and light in computations, which also enjoys intuitive explanations and visualizations."}

However, despite current success, it still faces important challenges when applied to small domains. Existing methods use transfer learning for I2I translation, but they still require the learning of millions of parameters from scratch. This drawback severely limits its application on small domains. In this paper, we propose a new transfer learning for I2I translation (TransferI2I). We decouple our learning process into the image generation step and the I2I translation step. In the first step we propose two novel techniques: source-target initialization and self-initialization of the adaptor layer. The former finetunes the pretrained generative model (e.g., StyleGAN) on source and target data. The latter allows to initialize all non-pretrained network parameters without the need of any data. These techniques provide a better initialization for the I2I translation. Second step performs the actual I2I translation using the learned weights in the first step. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary GAN that further facilitates the training of deep I2I systems even from small datasets. In extensive experiments on three datasets, (Animal faces, Birds, and Foods), we show that we outperform existing methods and that mFID improves on several datasets with over 25 points."}

However, collecting large-scale real-world training data for face recognition has turned out to be challenging, especially due to the label noise and privacy issues. Meanwhile, existing face recognition datasets are usually collected from web images, lacking detailed annotations on attributes (e.g., pose and expression), so the influences of different attributes on face recognition have been poorly investigated. In this paper, we address the above-mentioned issues in face recognition using synthetic face images, i.e., SynFace. Specifically, we first explore the performance gap between recent state-of-the-art face recognition models trained with synthetic and real face images. We then analyze the underlying causes behind the performance gap, e.g., the poor intra-class variations and the domain gap between synthetic and real face images. Inspired by this, we devise the SynFace with identity mixup (IM) and domain mixup (DM) to mitigate the above performance gap, demonstrating the great potentials of synthetic data for face recognition. Furthermore, with the controllable face synthesis model, we can easily manage different factors of synthetic face generation, including pose, expression, illumination, the number of identities, and samples per identity. Therefore, we also perform a systematically empirical analysis on synthetic face images to provide some insights on how to effectively utilize synthetic data for face recognition."}

However, NeRF requires querying a deep Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) millions of times, leading to slow rendering times, even on modern GPUs. In this paper, we demonstrate that real-time rendering is possible by utilizing thousands of tiny MLPs instead of one single large MLP. In our setting, each individual MLP only needs to represent parts of the scene, thus smaller and faster-to-evaluate MLPs can be used. By combining this divide-and-conquer strategy with further optimizations, rendering is accelerated by three orders of magnitude compared to the original NeRF model without incurring high storage costs. Further, using teacher-student distillation for training, we show that this speed-up can be achieved without sacrificing visual quality."}

Using an analysis-by-synthesis approach, we design a novel GAN architecture to synthesize a multiple-instance depth image with independent control over each instance. InSeGAN takes in a set of code vectors (e.g., random noise vectors), each encoding the 3D pose of an object that is represented by a learned implicit object template. The generator has two distinct modules. The first module, the instance feature generator, uses each encoded pose to transform the implicit template into a feature map representation of each object instance. The second module, the depth image renderer, aggregates all of the single-instance feature maps output by the first module and generates a multiple-instance depth image. A discriminator distinguishes the generated multiple-instance depth images from the distribution of true depth images. To use our model for instance segmentation, we propose an instance pose encoder that learns to take in a generated depth image and reproduce the pose code vectors for all of the object instances. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, \"Insta-10,\" consisting of 100,000 depth images each with 5 instances of an object from one of 10 classes. Our experiments on Insta-10, as well as on real-world noisy depth images, show that InSeGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, often outperforming prior methods by large margins."}

Stateof-the-art methods for multi-scale feature learning focus on performing feature interactions across space and scales using neural networks with a fixed topology. In this paper, we propose graph feature pyramid networks that are capable of adapting their topological structures to varying intrinsic image structures, and supporting simultaneous feature interactions across all scales. We first define an image specific superpixel hierarchy for each input image to represent its intrinsic image structures. The graph feature pyramid network inherits its structure from this superpixel hierarchy. Contextual and hierarchical layers are designed to achieve feature interactions within the same scale and across different scales, respectively. To make these layers more powerful, we introduce two types of local channel attention for graph neural networks by generalizing global channel attention for convolutional neural networks. The proposed graph feature pyramid network can enhance the multiscale features from a convolutional feature pyramid network. We evaluate our graph feature pyramid network in the object detection task by integrating it into the Faster RCNN algorithm. The modified algorithm not only outperforms previous state-of-the-art feature pyramid based methods with a clear margin but also outperforms other popular detection methods on both MS-COCO 2017 validation and test datasets."}

Typically, there are two types of neuromorphic vision sensors, namely dynamic vision sensor (DVS) and spike camera. From the perspective of bio-inspired sampling, DVS only perceives movement by imitating the retinal periphery, while the spike camera was developed to perceive fine textures by simulating the fovea. It is meaningful to explore how to combine two types of neuromorphic cameras to reconstruct high quality image like human vision. In this paper, we propose a NeuSpike-Net to learn both the high dynamic range and high motion sensitivity of DVS and the full texture sampling of spike camera to achieve high-speed and high dynamic image reconstruction. We propose a novel representation to effectively extract the temporal information of spike and event data. By introducing the feature fusion module, the two types of neuromorphic data achieve complementary to each other. The experimental results on the simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective to reconstruct high-speed and high dynamic range images via the combination of spike and event data."}

Moreover, the malicious adversaries crafted on the surrogate (source) model often exhibit black-box transferability on other models with the same learning task but having different architectures. Recently, various methods are proposed to boost the adversarial transferability, among which the input transformation is one of the most effective approaches. We investigate in this direction and observe that existing transformations are all applied on a single image, which might limit the adversarial transferability. To this end, we propose a new input transformation based attack method called Admix that considers the input image and a set of images randomly sampled from other categories. Instead of directly calculating the gradient on the original input, Admix calculates the gradient on the input image admixed with a small portion of each add-in image while using the original label of the input to craft more transferable adversaries."}

However, large portions of online videos contain irrelevant audio-visual signals because of edited/overdubbed audio, and models trained on such uncurated videos have shown to learn suboptimal representations. Therefore, existing self-supervised approaches rely on datasets with predetermined taxonomies of semantic concepts, where there is a high chance of audio-visual correspondence. Unfortunately, constructing such datasets require labor intensive manual annotation and/or verification, which severely limits the utility of online videos for large-scale learning. In this work, we present an automatic dataset curation approach based on subset optimization where the objective is to maximize the mutual information between audio and visual channels in videos. We demonstrate that our approach finds videos with high audio-visual correspondence and show that self-supervised models trained on our data achieve competitive performances compared to models trained on existing manually curated datasets. The most significant benefit of our approach is scalability: We release ACAV100M that contains 100 million videos with high audio-visual correspondence, ideal for self-supervised video representation learning."}

The point-based view is geometrically accurate, but it is disordered, which makes it difficult to find local neighbors efficiently. The voxel-based view is regular, but sparse, and computation grows cubicly when voxel resolution increases. The range-based view is regular and generally dense, however spherical projection makes physical dimensions distorted. Both voxel- and range-based views suffer from quantization loss, especially for voxels when facing large-scale scenes. In order to utilize different view's advantages and alleviate their own shortcomings in fine-grained segmentation task, we propose a novel range-point-voxel fusion network, namely RPVNet. In this network, we devise a deep fusion framework with multiple and mutual information interactions among these three views, and propose a gated fusion module (termed as GFM), which can adaptively merge the three features based on concurrent inputs. Moreover, the proposed RPV interaction mechanism is highly efficient, and we summarize it to a more general formulation. By leveraging this efficient interaction and relatively lower voxel resolution, our method is also proved to be more efficient. Finally, we evaluated the proposed model on two large-scale datasets, i.e., SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and it shows state-of-the-art performance on both of them. Note that, our method currently ranks 1st on SemanticKITTI leaderboard without any extra tricks."}

In doing so, it addresses some of the limitations of the state-of-the-art works, namely, a) that they discover directions that are independent of the latent code, i.e., paths that are linear, and b) that their evaluation relies either on visual inspection or on laborious human labeling. More specifically, we propose to learn non-linear warpings on the latent space, each one parametrized by a set of RBF-based latent space warping functions, and where each warping gives rise to a family of non-linear paths via the gradient of the function. Building on the work of Voynov and Babenko, that discovers linear paths, we optimize the trainable parameters of the set of RBFs, so as that images that are generated by codes along different paths, are easily distinguishable by a discriminator network. This leads to easily distinguishable image transformations, such as pose and facial expressions in facial images. We show that linear paths can be derived as a special case of our method, and show experimentally that non-linear paths in the latent space lead to steeper, more disentangled and interpretable changes in the image space than in state-of-the art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Unseen objects can be reconstructed from a single image, and then rendered from new viewpoints or their shape and texture edited by varying the latent codes.

Prior arts focus on tackling this task via warping clothes and fusing the information at the pixel level with the help of semantic segmentation. However, conducting semantic segmentation is time-consuming and easily causes error accumulation over time. Besides, warping the information at the pixel level instead of the feature level limits the performance (e.g., unable to generate different views) and is unstable since it directly demonstrates the results even with a misalignment. In contrast, fusing information at the feature level can be further refined by the convolution to obtain the final results. Based on these assumptions, we propose a co-attention feature-remapping framework, namely FashionMirror, that generates the try-on results according to the driven-pose sequence in two stages. In the first stage, we consider the source human image and the target try-on clothes to predict the removed mask and the try-on clothing mask, which replaces the pre-processed semantic segmentation and reduces the inference time. In the second stage, we first remove the clothes on the source human via the removed mask and warp the clothing features conditioning on the try-on clothing mask to fit the next frame human. Meanwhile, we predict the optical flows from the consecutive 2D poses and warp the source human to the next frame at the feature level. Then, we enhance the clothing features and source human features in every frame to generate realistic try-on results with spatio-temporal smoothness. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that FashionMirror outperforms the state-of-the-art virtual try-on approaches."}

The challenges in this area include the design of the visual architecture and the nature of the training data, in that the available large scale video-text training datasets, such as HowTo100M, are noisy and hence competitive performance is achieved only at scale through large amounts of compute. We address both these challenges in this paper. We propose an end-to-end trainable model that is designed to take advantage of both large-scale image and video captioning datasets. Our model is an adaptation and extension of the recent ViT and Timesformer architectures, and consists of attention in both space and time. The model is flexible and can be trained on both image and video text datasets, either independently or in conjunction. It is trained with a curriculum learning schedule that begins by treating images as 'frozen' snapshots of video, and then gradually learns to attend to increasing temporal context when trained on video datasets. We also provide a new video-text pretraining dataset WebVid-2M, comprised of over two million videos with weak captions scraped from the internet.

A third-party model can be poisoned such that it works adequately in normal conditions but behaves maliciously on samples with specific trigger patterns. However, the trigger injection function is manually defined in most existing backdoor attack methods, e.g., placing a small patch of pixels on an image or slightly deforming the image before poisoning the model. This results in a two-stage approach with a sub-optimal attack success rate and a lack of complete stealthiness under human inspection. In this paper, we propose a novel and stealthy backdoor attack framework, LIRA, which jointly learns the optimal, stealthy trigger injection function and poisons the model. We formulate such an objective as a non-convex, constrained optimization problem. Under this optimization framework, the trigger generator function will learn to manipulate the input with imperceptible noise to preserve the model performance on the clean data and maximize the attack success rate on the poisoned data. Then, we solve this challenging optimization problem with an efficient, two-stage stochastic optimization procedure. Finally, the proposed attack framework achieves 100% success rates in several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and T-ImageNet, while simultaneously bypassing existing backdoor defense methods and human inspection."}

Our approach predicts absolute scale depth maps over the entire scene consisting of a static background and multiple moving people, by training on dynamic scenes. Since it is difficult to collect dense depth maps from crowded indoor environments, we design our training framework without requiring groundtruth depths produced from depth sensing devices. Our network leverages RGB images and sparse depth maps generated from traditional 3D reconstruction methods to estimate dense depth maps. We use two constraints to handle depth for non-rigidly moving people without tracking their motion explicitly.

Our model receives as input an initial frame, its corresponding segmentation map and the sparse motion vectors encoding the input provided by the user. It outputs a plausible video sequence starting from the given frame and with a motion that is consistent with user input. Notably, our proposed deep architecture incorporates a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) modelling the movements of all the objects in the scene in a holistic manner and effectively combining the sparse user motion information and image features.

The common practice of fine-tuning is to adopt a default hyperparameter setting with a fixed pre-trained model, while both of them are not optimized for specific tasks and time constraints. Moreover, in cloud computing or GPU clusters where the tasks arrive sequentially in a stream, faster online fine-tuning is a more desired and realistic strategy for saving money, energy consumption, and CO2 emission. In this paper, we propose a joint Neural Architecture Search and Online Adaption framework named NASOA towards a faster task-oriented fine-tuning upon the request of users. Specifically, NASOA first adopts an offline NAS to identify a group of training-efficient networks to form a pretrained model zoo. We propose a novel joint block and macro level search space to enable a flexible and efficient search. Then, by estimating fine-tuning performance via an adaptive model by accumulating experience from the past tasks, an online schedule generator is proposed to pick up the most suitable model and generate a personalized training regime with respect to each desired task in a one-shot fashion. The resulting model zoo is more training efficient than SOTA NAS models, e.g. 6x faster than RegNetY-16GF, and 1.7x faster than EfficientNetB3. Experiments on multiple datasets also show that NASOA achieves much better fine-tuning results, i.e. improving around 2.1% accuracy than the best performance in RegNet series under various time constraints and tasks; 40x faster compared to the BOHB method."}

However, one major bottleneck is the scarcity of annotated real datasets, especially compared to 2D object detection tasks, since a large amount of labor is involved in annotating the real scans of a scene. A promising solution to this problem is to make better use of the synthetic dataset, which consists of CAD object models, to boost the learning on real datasets. This can be achieved by the pre-training and fine-tuning procedure. However, recent work on 3D pre-training exhibits failure when transfer features learned on synthetic objects to other real-world applications. In this work, we put forward a new method called RandomRooms to accomplish this objective. In particular, we propose to generate random layouts of a scene by making use of the objects in the synthetic CAD dataset and learn the 3D scene representation by applying object-level contrastive learning on two random scenes generated from the same set of synthetic objects. The model pre-trained in this way can serve as a better initialization when later fine-tuning on the 3D object detection task. Empirically, we show consistent improvement in downstream 3D detection tasks on several base models, especially when less training data are used, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Benefiting from the rich semantic knowledge and diverse objects from synthetic data, our method establishes the new state-of-the-art on widely-used 3D detection benchmarks ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D. We expect our attempt to provide a new perspective for bridging object and scene-level 3D understanding."}

Having only one of them clearly cannot realize real image editing. In this paper, we resolve this paradox by introducing consecutive images (e.g., video frames or the same person with different poses) into the inversion process. The rationale behind our solution is that the continuity of consecutive images leads to inherent editable directions. This inborn property is used for two unique purposes: 1) regularizing the joint inversion process, such that each of the inverted codes is semantically accessible from one of the other and fastened in an editable domain; 2) enforcing inter-image coherence, such that the fidelity of each inverted code can be maximized with the complement of other images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our alternative significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity and editability on both the real image dataset and synthesis dataset. Furthermore, our method provides the first support of video-based GAN inversion and an interesting application of unsupervised semantic transfer from consecutive images.

Yet most proposed methods either use complex mathematical tools that may limit their accessibility, or are tied to specific input data types and network architectures. In this paper, we introduce a general framework built on top of what we call Vector Neuron representations for creating SO(3)-equivariant neural networks for pointcloud processing. Extending neurons from 1D scalars to 3D vectors, our vector neurons enable a simple mapping of SO(3) actions to latent spaces thereby providing a framework for building equivariance in common neural operations -- including linear layers, non-linearities, pooling, and normalizations. Due to their simplicity, vector neurons are versatile and, as we demonstrate, can be incorporated into diverse network architecture backbones, allowing them to process geometry inputs in arbitrary poses. Despite its simplicity, our method performs comparably well in accuracy and generalization with other more complex and specialized state-of-the-art methods on classification and segmentation tasks.

Conformer roots in the Feature Coupling Unit (FCU), which fuses local features and global representations under different resolutions in an interactive fashion. Conformer adopts a concurrent structure so that local features and global representations are retained to the maximum extent. Experiments show that Conformer, under the comparable parameter complexity, outperforms the visual transformer (DeiT-B) by 2.3% on ImageNet. On MSCOCO, it outperforms ResNet-101 by 3.7% and 3.6% mAPs for object detection and instance segmentation, respectively, demonstrating the great potential to be a general backbone network.

We propose a novel adversarial training-based model by Attention Guided Knowledge Distillation and Bi-directional Metric Learning (AGKD-BML). The attention knowledge is obtained from a weight-fixed model trained on a clean dataset, referred to as a teacher model, and transferred to a model that is under training on adversarial examples (AEs), referred to as a student model. In this way, the student model is able to focus on the correct region, as well as correcting the intermediate features corrupted by AEs to eventually improve the model accuracy. Moreover, to efficiently regularize the representation in feature space, we propose a bidirectional metric learning. Specifically, given a clean image, it is first attacked to its most confusing class to get the forward AE. A clean image in the most confusing class is then randomly picked and attacked back to the original class to get the backward AE. A triplet loss is then used to shorten the representation distance between original image and its AE, while enlarge that between the forward and backward AEs. We conduct extensive adversarial robustness experiments on two widely used datasets with different attacks. Our proposed AGKD-BML model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

The existing sampling strategy often employs a fixed frame selection and lacks the flexibility to deal with complex variations in videos. In this paper, we present a simple, sparse, and explainable frame sampler, termed as Motion-Guided Sampler (MGSampler). Our basic motivation is that motion is an important and universal signal that can drive us to adaptively select frames from videos. Accordingly, we propose two important properties in our MGSampler design: motion sensitive and motion uniform. First, we present two different motion representations to enable us to efficiently distinguish the motion-salient frames from the background. Then, we devise a motion-uniform sampling strategy based on the cumulative motion distribution to ensure the sampled frames evenly cover all the important segments with high motion salience. Our MGSampler yields a new principled and holistic sample scheme, that could be incorporated into any existing video architecture. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our MGSampler over previous fixed sampling strategies, and its generalization power across different backbones, video models, and datasets."}

Several SSDA methods have been proposed recently, which however fail to fully exploit the value of the few labeled target samples. In this paper, we propose Enhanced Categorical Alignment and Consistency Learning (ECACL), a holistic SSDA framework that incorporates multiple mutually complementary domain alignment techniques. ECACL includes two categorical domain alignment techniques that achieve class-level alignment, a strong data augmentation based technique that enhances the model's generalizability and a consistency learning based technique that forces the model to be robust with image perturbations. These techniques are applied on one or multiple of the three inputs (labeled source, unlabeled target, and labeled target) and align the domains from different perspectives. ECACL unifies them together and achieves fairly comprehensive domain alignments that are much better than the existing methods: For example, ECACL raises the state-of-the-art accuracy from 68.4 to 81.1 on VisDA2017 and from 45.5 to 53.4 on DomainNet for the 1-shot setting.

The prevalent approaches adopt a hybrid objective of reconstruction and perceptual quality by using generative adversarial networks. However, the reconstruction loss and adversarial loss focus on synthesizing contents of different frequencies and simply applying them together often leads to inter-frequency conflicts and compromised inpainting. This paper presents WaveFill, a wavelet-based inpainting network that decomposes images into multiple frequency bands and fills the missing regions in each frequency band separately and explicitly. WaveFill decomposes images by using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) that preserves spatial information naturally. It applies L1 reconstruction loss to the decomposed low-frequency bands and adversarial loss to high-frequency bands, hence effectively mitigate inter-frequency conflicts while completing images in spatial domain. To address the inpainting inconsistency in different frequency bands and fuse features with distinct statistics, we design a novel normalization scheme that aligns and fuses the multi-frequency features effectively. Extensive experiments over multiple datasets show that WaveFill achieves superior image inpainting qualitatively and quantitatively."}

With a near infinite degree of freedom, a garment's full configuration (i.e., poses) is often described by the per-vertex 3D locations of its entire 3D surface. However, garments are also commonly subject to extreme cases of self-occlusion, especially when folded or crumpled, making it challenging to perceive their full 3D surface. To address these challenges, we propose GarmentNets, where the key idea is to formulate the deformable object pose estimation problem as a shape completion task in the canonical space. This canonical space is defined across garments instances within a category, therefore, specifies the shared category-level pose. By mapping the observed partial surface to the canonical space and completing it in this space, the output representation describes the garment's full configuration using a complete 3D mesh with the per-vertex canonical coordinate label. To properly handle the thin 3D structure presented on garments, we proposed a novel 3D shape representation using the generalized winding number field. Experiments demonstrate that GarmentNets is able to generalize to unseen garment instances and achieve significantly better performance compared to alternative approaches. Code and data will be available online."}

Existing approaches mainly consider the domain shift resulting from external environments including the changes of background, illumination or weather, while distinct camera intrinsic parameters appear commonly in different domains and their influence for domain adaptation has been very rarely explored. In this paper, we observe that the Field of View (FoV) gap induces noticeable instance appearance differences between the source and target domains. We further discover that the FoV gap between two domains impairs domain adaptation performance under both the FoV-increasing (source FoV < target FoV) and FoV-decreasing cases. Motivated by the observations, we propose the Position-Invariant Transform (PIT) to better align images in different domains. We also introduce a reverse PIT for mapping the transformed/aligned images back to the original image space, and design a loss re-weighting strategy to accelerate the training process. Our method can be easily plugged into existing cross-domain detection/segmentation frameworks, while bringing about negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can soundly boost the performance on both cross-domain object detection and segmentation for state-of-the-art techniques.

These cases happen when a model exploits spurious statistical regularities to produce correct answers but does not actually deploy the desired behavior. There is a need to identify possible shortcuts in a dataset and assess their use before deploying a model in the real world. The research community in VQA has focused exclusively on question-based shortcuts, where a model might, for example, answer \"What is the color of the sky\" with \"blue\" by relying mostly on the question-conditional training prior and give little weight to visual evidence. We go a step further and consider multimodal shortcuts that involve both questions and images. We first identify potential shortcuts in the popular VQA v2 training set by mining trivial predictive rules such as co-occurrences of words and visual elements. We then introduce VQA-CounterExamples (VQA-CE), an evaluation protocol based on our subset of CounterExamples i.e. image-question-answer triplets where our rules lead to incorrect answers. We use this new evaluation in a large-scale study of existing approaches for VQA. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models perform poorly and that existing techniques to reduce biases are largely ineffective in this context. Our findings suggest that past work on question-based biases in VQA has only addressed one facet of a complex issue.

The effectiveness of these techniques is, however, subject to the availability of a large number (several tens) of input views of the scene, and computationally demanding optimizations. In this paper, we tackle these limitations for the specific problem of few-shot full 3D head reconstruction, by endowing coordinate-based representations with a probabilistic shape prior that enables faster convergence and better generalization when using few input images (down to three). First, we learn a shape model of 3D heads from thousands of incomplete raw scans using implicit representations. At test time, we jointly overfit two coordinate-based neural networks to the scene, one modeling the geometry and another estimating the surface radiance, using implicit differentiable rendering. We devise a two-stage optimization strategy in which the learned prior is used to initialize and constrain the geometry during an initial optimization phase. Then, the prior is unfrozen and fine-tuned to the scene. By doing this, we achieve high-fidelity head reconstructions, including hair and shoulders, and with a high level of detail that consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art 3D Morphable Models methods in the few-shot scenario, and non-parametric methods when large sets of views are available."}

Recording these IRs is both time-intensive and expensive, and often infeasible for inaccessible locations.

We evaluate our method both by comparisons to ground truth data and by human expert evaluation.

Thus, TrivialAugment's effectiveness is very unexpected to us and we performed very thorough experiments to study its performance. First, we compare TrivialAugment to previous state-of-the-art methods in a variety of image classification scenarios. Then, we perform multiple ablation studies with different augmentation spaces, augmentation methods and setups to understand the crucial requirements for its performance. Additionally, we provide a simple interface to facilitate the widespread adoption of automatic augmentation methods, as well as our full code base for reproducibility.

Existing methods predict the 3D pose for each object independently or merely by combining local relationships within limited surroundings, but rarely explore the inherent geometric relationships from a global perspective. To address this issue, we argue that modeling geometric structure among objects in a scene is very crucial, and thus elaborately devise the Holistic Pose Graph (HPG) that explicitly integrates all geometric poses including the object pose treated as nodes and the relative pose treated as edges. The inference of the HPG uses GRU to encode the pose features from their corresponding regions in a single RGB image, and passes messages along the graph structure iteratively to improve the predicted poses. To further enhance the correspondence between the object pose and the relative pose, we propose a novel consistency loss to explicitly measure the deviations between them. Finally, we apply Holistic Pose Estimation (HPE) to jointly evaluate both the independent object pose and the relative pose. Our experiments on the SUN RGB-D dataset demonstrate that the proposed method provides a significant improvement on 3D object prediction."}

Most existing approaches employ the Faster R-CNN as basic detection framework, yet, due to the lack of tailored considerations for data-scarce scenario, their performance is often not satisfactory. In this paper, we look closely into the conventional Faster R-CNN and analyze its contradictions from two orthogonal perspectives, namely multi-stage (RPN vs. RCNN) and multi-task (classification vs. localization). To resolve these issues, we propose a simple yet effective architecture, named Decoupled Faster R-CNN (DeFRCN). To be concrete, we extend Faster R-CNN by introducing Gradient Decoupled Layer for multi-stage decoupling and Prototypical Calibration Block for multi-task decoupling. The former is a novel deep layer with redefining the feature-forward operation and gradient-backward operation for decoupling its subsequent layer and preceding layer, and the latter is an offline prototype-based classification model with taking the proposals from detector as input and boosting the original classification scores with additional pairwise scores for calibration.

Existing work predominantly utilizes either, (i) a pixelative format that treats sketches as natural images employing off-the-shelf CNN-based networks, or (ii) an elaborately designed vector format that leverages the structural information of drawing orders using sequential RNN-based methods. While the pixelative format lacks intuitive exploitation of structural cues, sketches in vector format are absent in most cases limiting their practical usage. Hence, in this paper, we propose a lattice structured sketch representation that not only removes the bottleneck of requiring vector data but also preserves the structural cues that vector data provides. Essentially, sketch lattice is a set of points sampled from the pixelative format of the sketch using a lattice graph. We show that our lattice structure is particularly amenable to structural changes that largely benefits sketch abstraction modeling for generation tasks. Our lattice representation could be effectively encoded using a graph model, that uses significantly fewer model parameters (13.5 times lesser) than existing state-of-the-art. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of sketch lattice for sketch manipulation, including sketch healing and image-to-sketch synthesis."}

Under this setting, we propose a flexible weakly-supervised multi-factor disentanglement framework DisUnknown, which Distills Unknown factors for enabling multi-conditional generation regarding both labeled and unknown factors. Specifically, a two-stage training approach is adopted to first disentangle the unknown factor with an effective and robust training method, and then train the final generator with the proper disentanglement of all labeled factors utilizing the unknown distillation.

However, its vulnerability to adversarial examples has not been sufficiently studied, especially under the practical scenario of black-box attacks, where the attacker can only access the query feedback of predicted bounding-boxes and top-1 scores returned by the attacked model. Compared with black-box attack to image classification, there are two main challenges in black-box attack to detection. Firstly, even if one bounding-box is successfully attacked, another sub-optimal bounding-box may be detected near the attacked bounding-box. Secondly, there are multiple bounding-boxes, leading to very high attack cost. To address these challenges, we propose a Parallel Rectangle Flip Attack (PRFA) via random search. Specifically, we generate perturbations in each rectangle patch to avoid sub-optimal detection near the attacked region. Besides, utilizing the observation that adversarial perturbations mainly locate around objects' contours and critical points under white-box attacks, the search space of attacked rectangles is reduced to improve the attack efficiency. Moreover, we develop a parallel mechanism of attacking multiple rectangles simultaneously to further accelerate the attack process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively and efficiently attack various popular object detectors, including anchor-based and anchor-free, and generate transferable adversarial examples."}

We first propose to use estimated optical flow from ambient information of multiple video frames as a complementary guide for training a single-frame depth estimation network, helping to preserve edges and reduce over-smoothing issues. Utilizing optical flow, we also propose to fuse the data of multiple video frames to get a more accurate depth map. In particular, fused depth maps are more robust in occluded areas and incur less in flying pixels artifacts. We finally demonstrate that these more precise fused depth maps can be used as self-supervision for fine-tuning a single-frame depth estimation network to improve its performance. Our models' effectiveness is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art models on both synthetic and our newly introduced real datasets. The implementation code, training procedure, and both synthetic and captured real datasets are available at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/depthinspace."}

The key idea of our approach is to use Gaussian distributions to capture statistics on Rn and those on the space of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. The main challenge is how to parametrize those distributions. Towards this end, we develop methods for embedding Gaussian distributions in matrix groups based on the theory of Lie groups and Riemannian symmetric spaces. Our method relies on the Riemannian geometry of the underlying manifolds and has the advantage of encoding high-order statistics from 3D joint positions. We show that the proposed method achieves competitive results in two-person interaction recognition on two large-scale benchmarks for 3D human activity understanding."}

Most of the previous work utilizing motion is deterministic but there are stochastic methods that can model the inherent uncertainty of the future. Existing stochastic models either do not reason about motion explicitly or make limiting assumptions about the static part. In this paper, we reason about appearance and motion in the video stochastically by predicting the future based on the motion history. Explicit reasoning about motion without history already reaches the performance of current stochastic models. The motion history further improves the results by allowing to predict consistent dynamics several frames into the future. Our model performs comparably to the state-of-the-art models on the generic video prediction datasets, however, significantly outperforms them on two challenging real-world autonomous driving datasets with complex motion and dynamic background."}

Significant progress has been made in estimating hand and object separately with deep learning methods, simultaneous HO pose estimation and contact modeling has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we present an explicit contact representation namely Contact Potential Field (CPF), and a learning-fitting hybrid framework namely MIHO to Modeling the Interaction of Hand and Object. In CPF, we treat each contacting HO vertex pair as a spring-mass system. Hence the whole system forms a potential field with minimal elastic energy at the grasp position. Extensive experiments on the two commonly used benchmarks have demonstrated that our method can achieve state-of-the-art in several reconstruction metrics, and allow us to produce more physically plausible HO pose even when the ground-truth exhibits severe interpenetration or disjointedness.

However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM) for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness."}

Although previous approaches pre-define the type of dataset bias to prevent the network from learning it, recognizing the bias type in the real dataset is often prohibitive. This paper proposes a novel bias-tailored augmentation-based approach, BiaSwap, for learning debiased representation without requiring supervision on the bias type. Motivated by the phenomenon that the bias corresponds to the attributes the model learns as a shortcut, we utilize an image-to-image translation model optimized to transfer the attributes that the classifier often learns easily. As a prerequisite, we sort the training samples based on how much a biased model exploits them as a shortcut and divide them into bias-guiding and bias-contrary samples in an unsupervised manner. Afterwards, we utilize the CAM of GCE-trained classifier in the patch cooccurrence discriminator in order to focus on translating the bias attributes. Therefore, given the pair of bias-guiding and bias-contrary, the model generates the augmented bias-swapped image which contains the bias attributes from the bias-contrary images, while preserving bias-irrelevant ones in the bias-guiding images. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach against the baselines over both synthetic and real-world datasets. Even without careful supervision on the bias, BiaSwap achieves a remarkable performance on both unbiased and bias-guiding samples, implying the improved generalization capability of the model."}

It is hypothesized that the well known tendency of standard classifier training to overfit to popular classes can be exploited for effective transfer learning. Rather than eliminating this overfitting, e.g. by adopting popular class-balanced sampling methods, the learning algorithm should instead leverage this overfitting to transfer geometric information from popular to low-shot classes. A new classifier architecture, GistNet, is proposed to support this goal, using constellations of classifier parameters to encode the class geometry. A new learning algorithm is then proposed for GeometrIc Structure Transfer (GIST), with resort to a combination of loss functions that combine class-balanced and random sampling to guarantee that, while overfitting to the popular classes is restricted to geometric parameters, it is leveraged to transfer class geometry from popular to few-shot classes. This enables better generalization for few-shot classes without the need for the manual specification of class weights, or even the explicit grouping of classes into different types. Experiments on two popular long-tailed recognition datasets show that GistNet outperforms existing solutions to this problem."}

Our approach takes RGB images of a dynamic scene as input (e.g., from a monocular video recording), and creates a high-quality space-time geometry and appearance representation. We show that a single handheld consumer-grade camera is sufficient to synthesize sophisticated renderings of a dynamic scene from novel virtual camera views, e.g. a `bullet-time' video effect. NR-NeRF disentangles the dynamic scene into a canonical volume and its deformation. Scene deformation is implemented as ray bending, where straight rays are deformed non-rigidly. We also propose a novel rigidity network to better constrain rigid regions of the scene, leading to more stable results. The ray bending and rigidity network are trained without explicit supervision. Our formulation enables dense correspondence estimation across views and time, and compelling video editing applications such as motion exaggeration. Our code will be open sourced."}

We will show that this approach is easy to deploy, robust to style changes, and effective. Furthermore, it can be used for shape refinement given only single pen strokes.

Conventional work in temporal video segmentation and action detection focuses on localizing pre-defined action categories and thus does not scale to generic videos. Cognitive Science has known since last century that humans consistently segment videos into meaningful temporal chunks. This segmentation happens naturally, without pre-defined event categories and without being explicitly asked to do so. Here, we repeat these cognitive experiments on mainstream CV datasets; with our novel annotation guideline which addresses the complexities of taxonomy-free event boundary annotation, we introduce the task of Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) and the new benchmark Kinetics-GEBD. We view GEBD as an important stepping stone towards understanding the video as a whole, and believe it has been previously neglected due to a lack of proper task definition and annotations. Through experiment and human study we demonstrate the value of the annotations. Further, we benchmark supervised and un-supervised GEBD approaches on the TAPOS dataset and our Kinetics-GEBD.

The community has long enjoyed the benefits of synthesizing training data with graphics, but the domain gap between real and synthetic data has remained a problem, especially for human faces. Researchers have tried to bridge this gap with data mixing, domain adaptation, and domain-adversarial training, but we show that it is possible to synthesize data with minimal domain gap, so that models trained on synthetic data generalize to real in-the-wild datasets. We describe how to combine a procedurally-generated parametric 3D face model with a comprehensive library of hand-crafted assets to render training images with unprecedented realism and diversity. We train machine learning systems for face-related tasks such as landmark localization and face parsing, showing that synthetic data can both match real data in accuracy, as well as open up new approaches where manual labeling would be impossible."}

Automatic AU detection can improve the understanding of psychological conditions and emotional status. Recently, several deep learning methods have been proposed to detect AUs automatically. However, several challenges, such as poor extraction of fine-grained and robust local AUs information, model overfitting on person-specific features, as well as the limitation of datasets with wrong labels, remain to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a joint strategy called PIAP-DF to solve these problems, which involves 1) a multi-stage Pixel-Interested learning method with pixel-level attention for each AU; 2) an Anti Person-Specific method aiming to eliminate features associated with any individual as much as possible; 3) a semi-supervised learning method with Discrete Feedback, designed to effectively utilize unlabeled data and mitigate the negative impacts of wrong labels. Experimental results on the two popular AU detection datasets BP4D and DISFA prove that PIAP-DF can be the new state-of-the-art method. Compared with the current best method, PIAP-DF improves the average F1 score by 3.2% on BP4D and by 0.5% on DISFA. All modules of PIAP-DF can be easily removed after training to obtain a lightweight model for practical application."}

However, the construction of these parametric models is often tedious, as it requires heavy manual tweaking, and they struggle to represent additional complexity and details such as wrinkles or clothing. To this end, we propose Neural Parametric Models (NPMs), a novel, learned alternative to traditional, parametric 3D models, which does not require hand-crafted, object-specific constraints. In particular, we learn to disentangle 4D dynamics into latent-space representations of shape and pose, leveraging the flexibility of recent developments in learned implicit functions. Crucially, once learned, our neural parametric models of shape and pose enable optimization over the learned spaces to fit to new observations, similar to the fitting of a traditional parametric model, e.g., SMPL. This enables NPMs to achieve a significantly more accurate and detailed representation of observed deformable sequences. We show that NPMs improve notably over both parametric and non-parametric state of the art in reconstruction and tracking of monocular depth sequences of clothed humans and hands. Latent-space interpolation as well as shape / pose transfer experiments further demonstrate the usefulness of NPMs. Code is publicly available at https://pablopalafox.github.io/npms."}

Unlike existing neural network based optimization method that relies on estimated correspondences, our method directly optimizes over implicit volumes, eliminating the challenging step of matching pixels in indoor scenes. The key to our approach is to utilize the learning-based priors to guide the optimization process of NeRF. Our system firstly adapts a monocular depth network over the target scene by finetuning on its sparse SfM reconstruction. Then, we show that the shape-radiance ambiguity of NeRF still exists in indoor environments and propose to address the issue by employing the adapted depth priors to monitor the sampling process of volume rendering. Finally, a per-pixel confidence map acquired by error computation on the rendered image can be used to further improve the depth quality. Experiments show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on indoor scenes, with surprising findings presented on the effectiveness of correspondence-based optimization and NeRF-based optimization over the adapted depth priors. In addition, we show that the guided optimization scheme does not sacrifice the original synthesis capability of neural radiance fields, improving the rendering quality on both seen and novel views.

The rich notion of context incorporates several aspects including physics rules, statistical co-occurrences, and relative object sizes, among others. While previous work has focused on crowd-sourced out-of-context photographs from the web to study scene context, controlling the nature and extent of contextual violations has been a daunting task. Here we introduce a diverse, synthetic Out-of-Context Dataset (OCD) with fine-grained control over scene context. By leveraging a 3D simulation engine, we systematically control the gravity, object co-occurrences and relative sizes across 36 object categories in a virtual household environment. We conducted a series of experiments to gain insights into the impact of contextual cues on both human and machine vision using OCD. We conducted psychophysics experiments to establish a human benchmark for out-of-context recognition and then compared it with state-of-the-art computer vision models to quantify the gap between the two. We propose a context-aware recognition transformer model, fusing object and contextual information via multi-head attention.

In this work, we propose a novel system for integrated 3D object detection and tracking, which uses a dynamic object occupancy map and previous object states as spatial-temporal memory to assist object detection in future frames. This memory, together with the ego-motion from back-end odometry, guides the detector to achieve more efficient object proposal generation and more accurate object state estimation.

In this paper, we introduce Sub-bit Neural Networks (SNNs), a new type of binary quantization design tailored to compress and accelerate BNNs. SNNs are inspired by an empirical observation, showing that binary kernels learnt at convolutional layers of a BNN model are likely to be distributed over kernel subsets. As a result, unlike existing methods that binarize weights one by one, SNNs are trained with a kernel-aware optimization framework, which exploits binary quantization in the fine-grained convolutional kernel space. Specifically, our method includes a random sampling step generating layer-specific subsets of the kernel space, and a refinement step learning to adjust these subsets of binary kernels via optimization. Experiments on visual recognition benchmarks and the hardware deployment on FPGA validate the great potentials of SNNs. For instance, on ImageNet, SNNs of ResNet-18/ResNet-34 with 0.56-bit weights achieve 3.13/3.33 times runtime speed-up and 1.8 times compression over conventional BNNs with moderate drops in recognition accuracy.

This paper proposes the Chamfer OOD examples (CODEs), whose distribution is close to that of in-distribution samples, and thus could be utilized to alleviate the OOD overconfidence issue effectively by suppressing predictions on them. To obtain CODEs, we first generate seed OOD examples via slicing&splicing operations on in-distribution samples from different categories, and then feed them to the Chamfer generative adversarial network for distribution transformation, without accessing to any extra data. Training with suppressing predictions on CODEs is validated to alleviate the OOD overconfidence issue largely without hurting classification accuracy, and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

Most complex scenes, natural or human-designed, can be expressed as a meaningful arrangement of simpler compositional graphical primitives.

To do this, we propose LayoutTransformer, a novel framework that leverages self-attention to learn contextual relationships between layout elements and generate novel layouts in a given domain. Our framework allows us to generate a new layout either from an empty set or from an initial seed set of primitives, and can easily scale to support an arbitrary of primitives per layout. Furthermore, our analyses show that the model is able to automatically capture the semantic properties of the primitives.

Existing cross-view synthesis approaches focus on images, while video synthesis in such a case has not yet received enough attention. For geometrical and temporal consistency, our approach explicitly creates a 3D point cloud representation of the scene and maintains dense 3D-2D correspondences across frames that reflect the geometric scene configuration inferred from the satellite view. As for synthesis in the 3D space, we implement a cascaded network architecture with two hourglass modules to generate point-wise coarse and fine features from semantics and per-class latent vectors, followed by projection to frames and an upsampling module to obtain the final realistic video. By leveraging computed correspondences, the produced street-view video frames adhere to the 3D geometric scene structure and maintain temporal consistency. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate superior results compared to other state-of-the-art synthesis approaches that either lack temporal consistency or realistic appearance. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one to synthesize cross-view images to videos."}

However, existing works focus on OoD algorithms, such as invariant risk minimization, domain generalization, or stable learning, without considering the influence of deep model architectures on OoD generalization, which may lead to sub-optimal performance. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods search for architecture based on its performance on the training data, which may result in poor generalization for OoD tasks. In this work, we propose robust Neural Architecture Search for OoD generalization (NAS-OoD), which optimizes the architecture with respect to its performance on generated OoD data by gradient descent. Specifically, a data generator is learned to synthesize OoD data by maximizing losses computed by different neural architectures, while the goal for architecture search is to find the optimal architecture parameters that minimize the synthetic OoD data losses. The data generator and the neural architecture are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner, and the minimax training process effectively discovers robust architectures that generalize well for different distribution shifts. Extensive experimental results show that NAS-OoD achieves superior performance on various OoD generalization benchmarks with deep models having a much fewer number of parameters. In addition, on a real industry dataset, the proposed NAS-OoD method reduces the error rate by more than 70% compared with the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating the proposed method's practicality for real applications."}

Most previous works of AUC maximization focus on the perspective of optimization by designing efficient stochastic algorithms, and studies on generalization performance of large-scale DAM on difficult tasks are missing. In this work, we aim to make DAM more practical for interesting real-world applications (e.g., medical image classification). First, we propose a new margin-based min-max surrogate loss function for the AUC score (named as the AUC min-max-margin loss or simply AUC margin loss for short). It is more robust than the commonly used AUC square loss, while enjoying the same advantage in terms of large-scale stochastic optimization. Second, we conduct extensive empirical studies of our DAM method on four difficult medical image classification tasks, namely (i) classification of chest x-ray images for identifying many threatening diseases, (ii) classification of images of skin lesions for identifying melanoma, (iii) classification of mammogram for breast cancer screening, and (iv) classification of microscopic images for identifying tumor tissue. Our studies demonstrate that the proposed DAM method improves the performance of optimizing cross-entropy loss by a large margin, and also achieves better performance than optimizing the existing AUC square loss on these medical image classification tasks. Specifically, our DAM method has achieved the 1st place on Stanford CheXpert competition on Aug. 31, 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that makes DAM succeed on large-scale medical image datasets. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the advantages of the new AUC margin loss over the AUC square loss on benchmark datasets.

For example, an initial bounding box is needed to initialize visual object tracking. To date, all such work makes the assumption that the seed is a good one. However, in practice, from crowdsourcing to noisy automated seeds, this is often not the case. We hence propose the problem of seed rejection---determining whether to reject a seed based on the expected performance degradation when it is provided in place of a gold-standard seed. We provide a formal definition to this problem, and focus on two meaningful subgoals: understanding causes of error and understanding the model's response to noisy seeds conditioned on the primary input. With these goals in mind, we propose a novel training method and evaluation metrics for the seed rejection problem. We then use seeded versions of the viewpoint estimation and fine-grained classification tasks to evaluate these contributions. In these experiments, we show our method can reduce the number of seeds that need to be reviewed for a target performance by over 23% compared to strong baselines."}

However, they have been ignored in the 3D style research. Existing 3D style metrics typically operate on meshes or point clouds, and fail to account for end-user subjectivity by adopting fixed definitions of style, either through crowd-sourcing for style labels or hand-crafted features. We propose UVStyle-Net, a style similarity measure for B-Reps that leverages the style signals in the second order statistics of the activations in a pre-trained (unsupervised) 3D encoder, and learns their relative importance to a subjective end-user through few-shot learning. Our approach differs from all existing data-driven 3D style methods since it may be used in completely unsupervised settings, which is desirable given the lack of publicly available labeled B-Rep datasets. More importantly, the few-shot learning accounts for the inherent subjectivity associated with style. We show quantitatively that our proposed method with B-Reps is able to capture stronger style signals than alternative methods on meshes and point clouds despite its significantly greater computational efficiency. We also show it is able to generate meaningful style gradients with respect to the input shape, and that few-shot learning with as few as two positive examples selected by an end-user is sufficient to significantly improve the style measure. Finally, we demonstrate its efficacy on a large unlabeled public dataset of CAD models. Source code and data are available at https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/UVStyle-Net."}

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based image enhancement method covering multiple tonal styles using only a single model dubbed StarEnhancer. It can transform an image from one tonal style to another, even if that style is unseen. With a simple one-time setting, users can customize the model to make the enhanced images more in line with their aesthetics. To make the method more practical, we propose a well-designed enhancer that can process a 4K-resolution image over 200 FPS but surpasses the contemporaneous single style image enhancement methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Finally, our proposed enhancement method has good interactability, which allows the user to fine-tune the enhanced image using intuitive options."}

Two main challenges in VI-reID are intra-class variations across person images, and cross-modal discrepancies between visible and infrared images. Assuming that the person images are roughly aligned, previous approaches attempt to learn coarse image- or rigid part-level person representations that are discriminative and generalizable across different modalities. However, the person images, typically cropped by off-the-shelf object detectors, are not necessarily well-aligned, which distract discriminative person representation learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel feature learning framework that addresses these problems in a unified way. To this end, we propose to exploit dense correspondences between cross-modal person images. This allows to address the cross-modal discrepancies in a pixel-level, suppressing modality-related features from person representations more effectively. This also encourages pixel-wise associations between cross-modal local features, further facilitating discriminative feature learning for VI-reID. Extensive experiments and analyses on standard VI-reID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which significantly outperforms the state of the art."}

Recent works attempt to generate binaural audio in a multimodal learning framework using large quantities of videos with accompanying binaural audio. In contrast, we attempt a more challenging problem -- synthesizing binaural audios for a video with monaural audio in a weakly supervised setting and weakly semi-supervised setting. Our key idea is that any down-stream task that can be solved only using binaural audios can be used to provide proxy supervision for binaural audio generation, thereby reducing the reliance on explicit supervision. In this work, as a proxy-task for weak supervision, we use Sound Source Localization with only audio. We design a two-stage architecture called Localize-to-Binauralize Network (L2BNet). The first stage of L2BNet is a Stereo Generation (SG) network employed to generate two-stream audio from monaural audio using visual frame information as guidance. In the second stage, an Audio Localization (AL) network is designed to use the synthesized two-stream audio to localize sound sources in visual frames. The entire network is trained end-to-end so that the AL network provides necessary supervision for the SG network. We experimentally show that our weakly-supervised framework generates two-stream audio containing binaural cues. Through user study, we further validate that our proposed approach generates binaural-quality audio using as little as 10% of explicit binaural supervision data for the SG network."}

In this literature, we propose a single image desnowing algorithm to address the diversity of snow particles in shape and size. First, to better represent the complex snow shape, we apply the dual-tree wavelet transform and propose a complex wavelet loss in the network. Second, we propose a hierarchical decomposition paradigm in our network for better understanding the different sizes of snow particles. Last, we propose a novel feature called the contradict channel (CC) for the snow scenes. We find that the regions containing the snow particles tend to have higher intensity in the CC than that in the snow-free regions. We leverage this discriminative feature to construct the contradict channel loss for improving the performance of snow removal. Moreover, due to the limitation of existing snow datasets, to simulate the snow scenarios comprehensively, we propose a large-scale dataset called Comprehensive Snow Dataset (CSD). Experimental results show that the proposed method can favorably outperform existing methods in three synthetic datasets and real-world datasets.

Given a single image as input, MINE predicts a 4-channel image (RGB and volume density) at arbitrary depth values to jointly reconstruct the camera frustum and fill in occluded contents. The reconstructed and inpainted frustum can then be easily rendered into novel RGB or depth views using differentiable rendering. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K, KITTI and Flowers Light Fields show that our MINE outperforms state-of-the-art by a large margin in novel view synthesis.

Previous works attempt to globally fuse these images by using adjustable weighted coefficients. However, there is a serious semantic misalignment between different images from a global perspective, making these works suffer from poor generation quality and diversity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Local-Fusion Generative Adversarial Network (LoFGAN) for few-shot image generation. Instead of using these available images as a whole, we first randomly divide them into a base image and several reference images. Next, LoFGAN matches local representations between the base and reference images based on semantic similarities and replaces the local features with the closest related local features. In this way, LoFGAN can produce more realistic and diverse images at a more fine-grained level, and simultaneously enjoy the characteristic of semantic alignment. Furthermore, a local reconstruction loss is also proposed, which can provide better training stability and generation quality. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets, which successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method for few-shot image generation and downstream visual applications with limited data.

This enables fine-grained category retrieval of images in a collection annotated with coarse labels only. Our network is learned with a nearest-neighbor classifier objective, and an instance loss inspired by self-supervised learning. By jointly leveraging the coarse labels and the underlying fine-grained latent space, it significantly improves the accuracy of category-level retrieval methods.

We propose a new end-to-end self-supervised framework that overcomes this limitation by exploiting the equivariances present in natural signals.

At Stage-I, we propose a contextual patch matching module to generate a set of potential matching pairs of shadow and non-shadow patches. Combined with the potential contextual relationships between shadow and non-shadow regions, our well-designed contextual feature transfer (CFT) mechanism can transfer contextual information from non-shadow to shadow regions at different scales. With the reconstructed feature maps, we remove shadows at L and A/B channels separately. At Stage-II, we use an encoder-decoder to refine current results and generate the final shadow removal results. We evaluate our proposed CANet on two benchmark datasets and some real-world shadow images with complex scenes. Extensive experiment results strongly demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed CANet and exhibit superior performance to state-of-the-arts."}

In this paper, special considerations are given to those challenges and a set of good practices are consolidated for improving the performance of self-supervised monocular depth estimation in indoor environments. The proposed method mainly consists of two novel modules, i.e., a depth factorization module and a residual pose estimation module, each of which is designed to respectively tackle the aforementioned challenges. The effectiveness of each module is shown through a carefully conducted ablation study and the demonstration of the state-of-the-art performance on three indoor datasets, i.e., EuRoC, NYUv2 and 7-Scenes."}

The dataset contains a total of 1.5 million frames from nearly 19,000 videos capturing objects from 50 MS-COCO categories and, as such, it is significantly larger than alternatives both in terms of the number of categories and objects.

In this work, we propose a Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection (TOOD) that explicitly aligns the two tasks in a learning-based manner. First, we design a novel Task-aligned Head (T-Head) which offers a better balance between learning task-interactive and task-specific features, as well as a greater flexibility to learn the alignment via a task-aligned predictor. Second, we propose Task Alignment Learning (TAL) to explicitly pull closer (or even unify) the optimal anchors for the two tasks during training via a designed sample assignment scheme and a task-aligned loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on MS-COCO, where TOOD achieves a 51.1 AP at single-model single-scale testing. This surpasses the recent one-stage detectors by a large margin, such as ATSS (47.7 AP), GFL (48.2 AP), and PAA (49.0 AP), with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Qualitative results also demonstrate the effectiveness of TOOD for better aligning the tasks of object classification and localization. Code is available at https://github.com/fcjian/TOOD."}

Despite these efforts, UDA still has a long way to go to reach the fully supervised performance. To this end, we propose a Labeling Only if Required strategy, LabOR, where we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to adaptively give scarce labels to points that a UDA model is uncertain about. In order to find the uncertain points, we generate an inconsistency mask using the proposed adaptive pixel selector and we label these segment-based regions to achieve near supervised performance with only a small fraction (about 2.2%) ground truth points, which we call \"Segment based Pixel-Labeling (SPL).\" To further reduce the efforts of the human annotator, we also propose \"Point based Pixel-Labeling (PPL),\" which finds the most representative points for labeling within the generated inconsistency mask. This reduces efforts from 2.2% segment label to 40 points label while minimizing performance degradation. Through extensive experimentation, we show the advantages of this new framework for domain adaptive semantic segmentation while minimizing human labor costs."}

These assumptions often do not hold and we show, quantitatively and qualitatively, that they cause errors in the reconstructed 3D shape and pose. To address this, we introduce SPEC, the first in-the-wild 3D HPS method that estimates the perspective camera from a single image and employs this to reconstruct 3D human bodies more accurately. First, we train a neural network to estimate the field of view, camera pitch, and roll given an input image. We employ novel losses that improve the calibration accuracy over previous work. We then train a novel network that concatenates the camera calibration to the image features and uses these together to regress 3D body shape and pose. SPEC is more accurate than the prior art on the standard benchmark (3DPW) as well as two new datasets with more challenging camera views and varying focal lengths. Specifically, we create a new photorealistic synthetic dataset (SPEC-SYN) with ground truth 3D bodies and a novel in-the-wild dataset (SPEC-MTP) with calibration and high-quality reference bodies.

Two fundamental challenges of MSDA are: (i) how to deal with the diversity in the multiple source domains and (ii) how to cope with the data shift between the target domain and the source domains. In this paper, to address the first challenge, we propose a theoretical-guaranteed approach to combine domain experts locally trained on its own source domain to achieve a combined multi-source teacher that globally predicts well on the mixture of source domains. To address the second challenge, we propose to bridge the gap between the target domain and the mixture of source domains in the latent space via a generator or feature extractor. Together with bridging the gap in the latent space, we train a student to mimic the predictions of the teacher expert on both source and target examples. In addition, our approach is guaranteed with rigorous theory offered insightful justifications of how each component influences the transferring performance.

We explore the effects of contrastive learning from larger, less-curated image datasets such as YFCC, and find there is indeed a large difference in the resulting representation quality. We hypothesize that this curation gap is due to a shift in the distribution of image classes---which is more diverse and heavy-tailed---resulting in less relevant negative samples to learn from. We test this hypothesis with a new approach, Divide and Contrast (DnC), which alternates between contrastive learning and clustering-based hard negative mining. When pretrained on less curated datasets, DnC greatly improves the performance of self-supervised learning on downstream tasks, while remaining competitive with the current state-of-the-art on curated datasets."}

In the first module, the unknown density field is represented as a continuous and differentiable function, parameterized by a deep neural network. This network is learned, in a self-supervised fashion, from the incomplete or/and degraded input sinogram. After getting estimated through the sinogram prediction module, the density field is consistently refined in the second module using local and non-local geometrical priors. With these two core modules, we show that IntraTomo significantly outperforms existing approaches on several ill-posed inverse problems, such as limited angle tomography with a range of 45 degrees, sparse view tomographic reconstruction with as few as eight views, or super-resolution tomography with eight times increased resolution. The experiments on simulated and real data show that our approach can achieve results of unprecedented quality."}

It is the largest dataset of high quality for prohibited items detection, gathered from the real-world airport security inspection and annotated by professional security inspectors. Besides, for accurate prohibited item detection, we further propose the Lateral Inhibition Module (LIM) inspired by the fact that humans recognize these items by ignoring irrelevant information and focusing on identifiable characteristics, especially when objects are overlapped with each other. Specifically, LIM, the elaborately designed flexible additional module, suppresses the noisy information flowing maximumly by the Bidirectional Propagation (BP) module and activates the most identifiable charismatic, boundary, from four directions by Boundary Activation (BA) module.

In this paper we introduce Segmenter, a transformer model for semantic segmentation. In contrast to convolution-based methods, our approach allows to model global context already at the first layer and throughout the network. We build on the recent Vision Transformer (ViT) and extend it to semantic segmentation. To do so, we rely on the output embeddings corresponding to image patches and obtain class labels from these embeddings with a point-wise linear decoder or a mask transformer decoder. We leverage models pre-trained for image classification and show that we can fine-tune them on moderate sized datasets available for semantic segmentation. The linear decoder allows to obtain excellent results already, but the performance can be further improved by a mask transformer generating class masks. We conduct an extensive ablation study to show the impact of the different parameters, in particular the performance is better for large models and small patch sizes. Segmenter attains excellent results for semantic segmentation. It outperforms the state of the art on both ADE20K and Pascal Context datasets and is competitive on Cityscapes."}

In this paper, we address this issue by formulating DARTS as a bilinear optimization problem and introducing an Interactive Differentiable Architecture Search (IDARTS). We first develop a backtracking backpropagation process, which can decouple the relationships of different kinds of parameters and train them in the same framework. The backtracking method coordinates the training of different parameters that fully explore their interaction and optimize training. We present experiments on the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets that demonstrate the efficacy of the IDARTS approach by achieving a top-1 accuracy of 76.52% on ImageNet without additional search cost vs. 75.8% with the state-of-the-art PC-DARTS."}

To solve them, we propose a novel differentiable evolutionary framework named AutoSpace, which evolves the search space to an optimal one with following novel techniques: a differentiable fitness scoring function to efficiently evaluate the performance of cells and a reference architecture to speedup the evolution procedure and avoid falling into sub-optimal solutions. The framework is generic and compatible with additional computational constraints, making it feasible to learn specialized search spaces that fit different computational budgets. With the learned search space, the performance of recent NAS algorithms can be improved significantly compared with using manually de-signed spaces.

However, for ObjectGoal navigation (\"\"find a TV\"\"), this is an open question; one we tackle in this paper. The current best-known result on ObjectNav with general-purpose models is 6% success rate. First, we show that the key problem is overfitting. Large-scale training results in 94% success rate on training environments and only 8% in validation. We observe that this stems from agents memorizing environment layouts during training -- sidestepping the need for exploration and directly learning shortest paths to nearby goal objects. We show that this is a natural consequence of optimizing for the task metric (which in fact penalizes exploration), is enabled by powerful observation encoders, and is possible due to the finite set of training environment configurations. Informed by our findings, we introduce Treasure Hunt Data Augmentation (THDA) to address overfitting in ObjectNav. THDA inserts 3D scans of household objects at arbitrary scene locations and uses them as ObjectNav goals -- augmenting and greatly expanding the set of training layouts.

Our method performs element-wise swapping for partial features between samples to inject noise during training. It equips a regularization effect similar to Dropout, which promotes more neurons to represent the concepts. Furthermore, it also exhibits other advantages: 1) suppressing over-activation to some part patterns to improve feature representativeness, and 2) enriching pattern combination and simulating noisy cases to enhance classifier generalization. We verify the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments across four network backbones and three fine-grained datasets. Moreover, we demonstrate its ability to complement high-level representations, allowing a simple model to achieve performance comparable to the top-performing technologies in fine-grained recognition, indoor scene recognition, and material recognition while improving model interpretability."}

In this work, the problem of visual social distancing compliance assessment in busy public areas, with wide field-of-view cameras, is considered. A dataset of crowd scenes with people annotations under a bird's eye view (BEV) and ground truth for metric distances is introduced, and several measures for the evaluation of social distance detection systems are proposed. A multi-branch network, BEV-Net, is proposed to localize individuals in world coordinates and identify high-risk regions where social distancing is violated. BEV-Net combines detection of head and feet locations, camera pose estimation, a differentiable homography module to map image into BEV coordinates, and geometric reasoning to produce a BEV map of the people locations in the scene. Experiments on complex crowded scenes demonstrate the power of the approach and show superior performance over baselines derived from methods in the literature. Applications of interest for public health decision makers are finally discussed. Datasets, code and pretrained models are publicly available at GitHub."}

Furthermore, we develop a methodology for evaluating expected recovery performance for different types and shapes of objects."}

However, the dominant consistency learning diagram is limited by a) the misalignment between features from labeled and unlabeled data; b) treating each image and region separately without considering crucial semantic dependencies among classes. In this work, we introduce a novel C^3-SemiSeg to improve consistency-based semi-supervised learning by exploiting better feature alignment under perturbations and enhancing discriminative of the inter-class features cross images. Specifically, we first introduce a cross-set region-level data augmentation strategy to reduce the feature discrepancy between labeled data and unlabeled data. Cross-set pixel-wise contrastive learning is further integrated into the pipeline to facilitate discriminative and consistent intra-class features in a `compared to learn' way. To stabilize training from the noisy label, we propose a dynamic confidence region selection strategy to focus on the high confidence region for loss calculation. We validate the proposed approach on Cityscapes and BDD100K dataset, which significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods."}

By directly mapping raw pixels to model parameters, these methods can produce parametric models in a feed-forward manner via neural networks. However, minor deviation in parameters may lead to noticeable misalignment between the estimated meshes and image evidences. To address this issue, we propose a Pyramidal Mesh Alignment Feedback (PyMAF) loop to leverage a feature pyramid and rectify the predicted parameters explicitly based on the mesh-image alignment status in our deep regressor. In PyMAF, given the currently predicted parameters, mesh-aligned evidences will be extracted from finer-resolution features accordingly and fed back for parameter rectification. To reduce noise and enhance the reliability of these evidences, an auxiliary pixel-wise supervision is imposed on the feature encoder, which provides mesh-image correspondence guidance for our network to preserve the most related information in spatial features. The efficacy of our approach is validated on several benchmarks, including Human3.6M, 3DPW, LSP, and COCO, where experimental results show that our approach consistently improves the mesh-image alignment of the reconstruction.

However, existed approaches pre-train a one-stream model to learn joint vision-language representation, which suffers from calculation explosion when conducting cross-modal retrieval. In this work, we propose the Contrastive Cross-Modal Knowledge Sharing Pre-training (COOKIE) method to learn universal text-image representations. There are two key designs in it, one is the weight-sharing transformer on top of the visual and textual encoders to align text and image semantically, the other is three kinds of contrastive learning designed for sharing knowledge between different modalities. Cross-modal knowledge sharing greatly promotes the learning of unimodal representation. Experiments on multi-modal matching tasks including cross-modal retrieval, text matching, and image retrieval show the effectiveness and efficiency of our pre-training framework. Our COOKIE fine-tuned on cross-modal datasets MSCOCO, Flickr30K, and MSRVTT achieves new state-of-the-art results while using only 3/1000 inference time comparing to one-stream models. There are also 5.7 and 3.9 improvements in the task of image retrieval and text matching. Source code will be made public."}

LaLaLoc learns a rich embedding space shared between RGB panoramas and layouts inferred from a known floor plan that encodes the structural similarity between locations.

EPP-MVSNet can accurately aggregate features at high resolution to a limited cost volume with an optimal depth range, thus, leads to effective and efficient 3D construction. Distinct from existing works which measure feature cost at discrete positions which affects the 3D reconstruction accuracy, EPP-MVSNet introduces an epipolar assembling-based kernel that operates on adaptive intervals along epipolar lines for making full use of the image resolution. Further, we introduce an entropy-based refining strategy where the cost volume describes the space geometry with the little redundancy.

Unlike prior works on neural radiance fields that consider per-scene optimization on densely captured images, we propose a generic deep neural network that can reconstruct radiance fields from only three nearby input views via fast network inference. Our approach leverages plane-swept cost volumes (widely used in multi-view stereo) for geometry-aware scene reasoning, and combines this with physically based volume rendering for neural radiance field reconstruction. We train our network on real objects in the DTU dataset, and test it on three different datasets to evaluate its effectiveness and generalizability. Our approach can generalize across scenes (even indoor scenes, completely different from our training scenes of objects) and generate realistic view synthesis results using only three input images, significantly outperforming concurrent works on generalizable radiance field reconstruction. Moreover, if dense images are captured, our estimated radiance field representation can be easily fine-tuned; this leads to fast per-scene reconstruction with higher rendering quality and substantially less optimization time than NeRF."}

Our model is motivated by the recently proposed linear transforms based tensor-tensor product and tensor SVD. We define a new transforms depended tensor rank and the corresponding tensor nuclear norm. Then we solve the TRPCA problem by convex optimization whose objective is a weighted combination of the new tensor nuclear norm and l_1-norm. In theory, we prove that under some incoherence conditions, the convex program exactly recovers the underlying low-rank and sparse components with high probability. Our new TRPCA is much more general since it allows to use any invertible linear transforms. Thus, we have more choices in practice for different tasks and different type of data. Numerical experiments verify our results and the application on image recovery demonstrates the superiority of our method."}

The straightforward solution of supersampling by rendering with multiple rays per pixel is impractical for NeRF, because rendering each ray requires querying a multilayer perceptron hundreds of times. Our solution, which we call \"mip-NeRF\" (a la \"mipmap\"), extends NeRF to represent the scene at a continuously-valued scale. By efficiently rendering anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays, mip-NeRF reduces objectionable aliasing artifacts and significantly improves NeRF's ability to represent fine details, while also being 7% faster than NeRF and half the size. Compared to NeRF, mip-NeRF reduces average error rates by 17% on the dataset presented with NeRF and by 60% on a challenging multiscale variant of that dataset that we present. Mip-NeRF is also able to match the accuracy of a brute-force supersampled NeRF on our multiscale dataset while being 22x faster."}

Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem by trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead of the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting might make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely imbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a novel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP), which always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all intervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably introduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose another criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects the best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during inference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly negligible. As far as we are aware, this work is the first to delve into such a classification task and ends up with a promising solution for count interval partition. Following the above two theoretically demonstrated criterions, we propose a simple yet effective model termed Uniform Error Partition Network (UEPNet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging datasets.

Existing methods often align low dynamic range (LDR) input sequence in the image space using optical flow, and then merge the aligned images to produce HDR output. However, accurate alignment and fusion in the image space are difficult due to the missing details in the over-exposed regions and noise in the under-exposed regions, resulting in unpleasing ghosting artifacts. To enable more accurate alignment and HDR fusion, we introduce a coarse-to-fine deep learning framework for HDR video reconstruction. Firstly, we perform coarse alignment and pixel blending in the image space to estimate the coarse HDR video. Secondly, we conduct more sophisticated alignment and temporal fusion in the feature space of the coarse HDR video to produce better reconstruction. Considering the fact that there is no publicly available dataset for quantitative and comprehensive evaluation of HDR video reconstruction methods, we collect such a benchmark dataset, which contains 97 sequences of static scenes and 184 testing pairs of dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our dataset, code and model will be made publicly available."}

Events, on the other hand, have their unique challenges: rather than capturing static body postures, the event signals are best at capturing local motions. This leads us to propose a two-stage deep learning approach, called EventHPE. The first-stage, FlowNet, is trained by unsupervised learning to infer optical flow from events. Both events and optical flow are closely related to human body dynamics, which are fed as input to the ShapeNet in the second stage, to estimate 3D human shapes. To mitigate the discrepancy between image-based flow (optical flow) and shape-based flow (vertices movement of human body shape), a novel flow coherence loss is introduced by exploiting the fact that both flows are originated from the identical human motion. An in-house event-based 3D human dataset is curated that comes with 3D pose and shape annotations, which is by far the largest one to our knowledge. Empirical evaluations on DHP19 dataset and our in-house dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

Unfortunately, existing methods such as DVR or IDR require accurate per-pixel object masks as supervision. At the same time, neural radiance fields have revolutionized novel view synthesis. However, NeRF's estimated volume density does not admit accurate surface reconstruction. Our key insight is that implicit surface models and radiance fields can be formulated in a unified way, enabling both surface and volume rendering using the same model. This unified perspective enables novel, more efficient sampling procedures and the ability to reconstruct accurate surfaces without input masks. We compare our method on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and a synthetic indoor dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that we outperform NeRF in terms of reconstruction quality while performing on par with IDR without requiring masks."}

In this work, we propose a model called TransPose, which introduces Transformer for human pose estimation. The attention layers built in Transformer enable our model to capture long-range relationships efficiently and also can reveal what dependencies the predicted keypoints rely on. To predict keypoint heatmaps, the last attention layer acts as an aggregator, which collects contributions from image clues and forms maximum positions of keypoints. Such a heatmap-based localization approach via Transformer conforms to the principle of Activation Maximization. And the revealed dependencies are image-specific and fine-grained, which also can provide evidence of how the model handles special cases, e.g., occlusion. The experiments show that TransPose achieves 75.8 AP and 75.0 AP on COCO validation and test-dev sets, while being more lightweight and faster than mainstream CNN architectures. The TransPose model also transfers very well on MPII benchmark, achieving superior performance on the test set when fine-tuned with small training costs.

From a novel perspective, we argue that the bridging between the source and target domains can be utilized to tackle the UDA re-ID task, and we focus on explicitly modeling appropriate intermediate domains to characterize this bridging. Specifically, we propose an Intermediate Domain Module (IDM) to generate intermediate domains' representations on-the-fly by mixing the source and target domains' hidden representations using two domain factors. Based on the \"shortest geodesic path\" definition, i.e., the intermediate domains along the shortest geodesic path between the two extreme domains can play a better bridging role, we propose two properties that these intermediate domains should satisfy. To ensure these two properties to better characterize appropriate intermediate domains, we enforce the bridge losses on intermediate domains' prediction space and feature space, and enforce a diversity loss on the two domain factors. The bridge losses aim at guiding the distribution of appropriate intermediate domains to keep the right distance to the source and target domains. The diversity loss serves as a regularization to prevent the generated intermediate domains from being over-fitting to either of the source and target domains. Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a large margin in all the common UDA re-ID tasks, and the mAP gain is up to 7.7% on the challenging MSMT17 benchmark.

However, not much progress has been made on extending it to work in an online fashion, although many video related tasks can benefit by going online with the growing video streaming services. To this end, we introduce a new task called Online Temporal Action Localization (On-TAL), in which the goal is to immediately detect action instances from an untrimmed streaming video. The online setting makes the new task very challenging as the actionness decision for every frame has to be made without access to future frames and also because post-processing methods cannot be used to modify past action proposals. We propose a novel framework, Context-Aware Actionness Grouping (CAG) as a solution for On-TAL and train it with the imitation learning algorithm, which allows us to avoid sophisticated reward engineering. Evaluation of our work on THUMOS14 and Activitynet1.3 shows significant improvement over non-naive baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

We conduct an empirical investigation of embedding geometry on softmax losses for a variety of fixed-set classification and image retrieval tasks. An interesting property observed for the spherical losses lead us to propose a probabilistic classifier based on the von Mises-Fisher distribution, and we show that it is competitive with state-of-the-art methods while producing improved out-of-the-box calibration.

Existing FFG methods aim to disentangle content and style either by extracting a universal representation style or extracting multiple component-wise style representations. However, previous methods either fail to capture diverse local styles or cannot be generalized to a character with unseen components, e.g., unseen language systems. To mitigate the issues, we propose a novel FFG method, named Multiple Localized Experts Few-shot Font Generation Network (MX-Font). MX-Font extracts multiple style features not explicitly conditioned on component labels, but automatically by multiple experts to represent different local concepts, e.g., left-side sub-glyph. Owing to the multiple experts, MX-Font can capture diverse local concepts and show the generalizability to unseen languages. During training, we utilize component labels as weak supervision to guide each expert to be specialized for different local concepts. We formulate the component assign problem to each expert as the graph matching problem, and solve it by the Hungarian algorithm. We also employ the independence loss and the content-style adversarial loss to impose the content-style disentanglement. In our experiments, MX-Font outperforms previous state-of-the-art FFG methods in the Chinese generation and cross-lingual, e.g., Chinese to Korean, generation."}

Extracting confident examples has been widely studied in the community of learning with noisy labels. However, it remains elusive how to extract hard confident examples from the noisy training data. In this paper, we propose a deep learning paradigm to solve this problem, which is built on the memorization effect of deep neural networks that they would first learn simple patterns, i.e., which are defined by these shared by multiple training examples. To extract hard confident examples that contain non-simple patterns and are entangled with the inaccurately labeled examples, we borrow the idea of momentum from physics. Specifically, we alternately update the confident examples and refine the classifier. Note that the extracted confident examples in the previous round can be exploited to learn a better classifier and that the better classifier will help identify better (and hard) confident examples. We call the approach the \"Momentum of Memorization\" (Me-Momentum). Empirical results on benchmark-simulated and real-world label-noise data illustrate the effectiveness of Me-Momentum for extracting hard confident examples, leading to better classification performance."}

Our method consists of a partially-supervised adaptation stage and a fully-supervised adaptation stage. In the former, partial knowledge is transferred from multiple source domains to the target domain and fused therein. Negative transfer between unmatching label spaces is mitigated via three new modules: domain attention, uncertainty maximization and attention-guided adversarial alignment. In the latter, knowledge is transferred in the unified label space after a label completion process with pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on three different tasks - image classification, 2D semantic image segmentation, and joint 2D-3D semantic segmentation - show that our method outperforms all competing methods significantly."}

We propose the TransFER model which can learn rich relation-aware local representations. It mainly consists of three components: Multi-Attention Dropping (MAD), ViT-FER, and Multi-head Self-Attention Dropping (MSAD). First, local patches play an important role in distinguishing various expressions, however, few existing works can locate discriminative and diverse local patches. This can cause serious problems when some patches are invisible due to pose variations or viewpoint changes. To address this issue, the MAD is proposed to randomly drop an attention map. Consequently, models are pushed to explore diverse local patches adaptively. Second, to build rich relations between different local patches, the Vision Transformers (ViT) are used in FER, called ViT-FER. Since the global scope is used to reinforce each local patch, a better representation is obtained to boost the FER performance. Thirdly, the multi-head self-attention allows ViT to jointly attend to features from different information subspaces at different positions. Given no explicit guidance, however, multiple self-attentions may extract similar relations. To address this, the MSAD is proposed to randomly drop one self-attention module. As a result, models are forced to learn rich relations among diverse local patches. Our proposed TransFER model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several FER benchmarks, showing its effectiveness and usefulness."}

DNNs are shown to be vulnerable against the Trojan attack that manipulates the model parameters via poisoned training and gets activated by the pre-defined trigger in inputs during inference. In this work, we present ProFlip, the first targeted Trojan attack framework that can divert the prediction of the DNN to the target class by progressively identifying and flipping a small set of bits in model parameters. At its core, ProFlip consists of three key phases: (i) Determining significant neurons in the last layer; (ii) Generating an effective trigger pattern for the target class; (iii) Identifying a sequence of susceptible bits of DNN parameters stored in the main memory (e.g., DRAM). After model deployment, the adversary can insert the Trojan by flipping the critical bits found by ProFlip using bit flip techniques such as Row Hammer or laser beams. As the result, the altered DNN predicts the target class when the trigger pattern is present in any inputs. We perform extensive evaluations of ProFlip on CIFAR10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets with ResNet-18 and VGG-16 architectures. Empirical results show that, to reach an attack success rate (ASR) of over 94%, ProFlip requires only 12 bit flips out of 88 million parameter bits for ResNet-18 with CIFAR-10, and 15 bit flips for ResNet-18 with ImageNet. Compared to the SOTA, ProFlip reduces the number of required bits flips by 28x   34x while reaching the same level of ASR."}

However, the design of transformer networks is challenging. It has been observed that the depth, embedding dimension, and number of heads can largely affect the performance of vision transformers. Previous models configure these dimensions based upon manual crafting. In this work, we propose a new one-shot architecture search framework, namely AutoFormer, dedicated to vision transformer search. AutoFormer entangles the weights of different blocks in the same layers during supernet training. Benefiting from the strategy, the trained supernet allows thousands of subnets to be very well-trained. Specifically, the performance of these subnets with weights inherited from the supernet is comparable to those retrained from scratch. Besides, the searched models, which we refer to AutoFormers, surpass the recent state-of-the-arts such as ViT and DeiT. In particular, AutoFormer-tiny/small/base achieve 74.7%/81.7%/82.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 5.7M/22.9M/53.7M parameters, respectively. Lastly, we verify the transferability of AutoFormer by providing the performance on downstream benchmarks and distillation experiments.

However, most approaches carry out ReID only based upon holistic pedestrian regions. In contrast, real-world scenarios involve occluded pedestrians, which provide partial visual appearances and destroy the ReID accuracy. A common strategy is to locate visible body parts by auxiliary model, which however suffers from significant domain gaps and data bias issues. To avoid such problematic models in occluded person ReID, we propose the Occlusion-Aware Mask Network (OAMN). In particular, we incorporate an attention-guided mask module, which requires guidance from labeled occlusion data. To this end, we propose a novel occlusion augmentation scheme that produces diverse and precisely labeled occlusion for any holistic dataset. The proposed scheme suits real-world scenarios better than existing schemes, which consider only limited types of occlusions. We also offer a novel occlusion unification scheme to tackle ambiguity information at the test phase. The above three components enable existing attention mechanisms to precisely capture body parts regardless of the occlusion. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of person ReID benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of OAMN over state-of-the-arts."}

A thorough video understanding needs to fuse time-series data of different modalities for prediction. Due to the variable receiving frequency for sequences from each modality, there usually exists inherent asynchrony across the collected multimodal streams. Towards an efficient multimodal fusion from asynchronous multimodal streams, we need to model the correlations between elements from different modalities. The recent Multimodal Transformer (MulT) approach extends the self-attention mechanism of the original Transformer network to learn the crossmodal dependencies between elements. However, the direct replication of self-attention will suffer from the distribution mismatch across different modality features. As a result, the learnt crossmodal dependencies can be unreliable. Motivated by this observation, this work proposes the Modality-Invariant Crossmodal Attention (MICA) approach towards learning crossmodal interactions over modality-invariant space in which the distribution mismatch between different modalities is well bridged. To this end, both the marginal distribution and the elements with high-confidence correlations are aligned over the common space of the query and key vectors which are computed from different modalities. Experiments on three standard benchmarks of multimodal video understanding clearly validate the superiority of our approach."}

Their predictions, however, are prone to be corrupted by adversarial examples that are imperceptible to humans. Current efforts to improve the robustness of neural networks against adversarial examples are focused on developing robust training methods, which update the weights of a neural network in a more robust direction. In this work, we take a step beyond training of the weight parameters and consider the problem of designing an adversarially robust neural architecture with high intrinsic robustness. We propose AdvRush, a novel adversarial robustness-aware neural architecture search algorithm, based upon a finding that independent of the training method, the intrinsic robustness of a neural network can be represented with the smoothness of its input loss landscape. Through a regularizer that favors a candidate architecture with a smoother input loss landscape, AdvRush successfully discovers an adversarially robust neural architecture. Along with a comprehensive theoretical motivation for AdvRush, we conduct an extensive amount of experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of AdvRush on various benchmark datasets. Notably, on CIFAR-10, AdvRush achieves 55.91% robust accuracy under FGSM attack after standard training and 50.04% robust accuracy under AutoAttack after 7-step PGD adversarial training."}

However, the importance of the phase spectrum of the image for a robust vision system is still ignored. In this paper, we notice that the CNN tends to converge at the local optimum which is closely related to the high-frequency components of the training images, while the amplitude spectrum is easily disturbed such as noises or common corruptions. In contrast, more empirical studies found that humans rely on more phase components to achieve robust recognition. This observation leads to more explanations of the CNN's generalization behaviors in both robustness to common perturbations and out-of-distribution detection, and motivates a new perspective on data augmentation designed by re-combing the phase spectrum of the current image and the amplitude spectrum of the distracter image. That is, the generated samples force the CNN to pay more attention to the structured information from phase components and keep robust to the variation of the amplitude. Experiments on several image datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on multiple generalizations and calibration tasks, including adaptability for common corruptions and surface variations, out-of-distribution detection, and adversarial attack."}

Our method generates the movements of a complete upper body, including arms, hands, and the head. Although recent data-driven methods achieve great success, challenges still exist, such as limited variety, poor fidelity, and lack of objective metrics. Motivated by the fact that the speech cannot fully determine the gesture, we design a method that learns a set of gesture template vectors to model the latent conditions, which relieve the ambiguity. For our method, the template vector determines the general appearance of a generated gesture sequence, while the speech audio drives subtle movements of the body, both indispensable for synthesizing a realistic gesture sequence. Due to the intractability of an objective metric for gesture-speech synchronization, we adopt the lip-sync error as a proxy metric to tune and evaluate the synchronization ability of our model. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method in both objective and subjective evaluations on fidelity and synchronization."}

However, in terms of visual perception of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the ability for recognizing abstract objects (visual objects with lost information) is still a challenge. In this work, we investigate this issue from an adversarial viewpoint: will the performance of DNNs decrease even for the images only losing a little information? Towards this end, we propose a novel adversarial attack, named AdvDrop, which crafts adversarial examples by dropping existing information of images. Previously, most adversarial attacks add extra disturbing information on clean images explicitly. Opposite to previous works, our proposed work explores the adversarial robustness of DNN models in a novel perspective by dropping imperceptible details to craft adversarial examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdvDrop by extensive experiments, and show that this new type of adversarial examples is more difficult to be defended by current defense systems."}

Furthermore, we introduce a flexible optimization-based approach that leverages HuMoR as a motion prior to robustly estimate plausible pose and shape from ambiguous observations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our model generalizes to diverse motions and body shapes after training on a large motion capture dataset, and enables motion reconstruction from multiple input modalities including 3D keypoints and RGB(-D) videos."}

However, how to construct good cascade volume as well as effective sampling for them are still under in-depth study. Previous cascade-based methods usually perform uniform sampling in a predicted disparity range based on variance, which easily misses the ground truth disparity and decreases disparity map accuracy. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty adaptive sampling network (UASNet) featuring two modules: an uncertainty distribution-guided range prediction (URP) model and an uncertainty-based disparity sampler (UDS) module. The URP explores the more discriminative uncertainty distribution to handle the complex matching ambiguities and to improve disparity range prediction. The UDS adaptively adjusts sampling interval to localize disparity with improved accuracy. With the proposed modules, our UASNet learns to construct cascade cost volume and predict full-resolution disparity map directly. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves the highest ground truth covering ratio compared with other cascade cost volume based stereo matching methods. Our method also achieves top performance on both SceneFlow dataset and KITTI benchmark."}

The existing action detection benchmarks are limited in aspects of small numbers of instances in a trimmed video or low-level atomic actions. This paper aims to present a new multi-person dataset of spatio-temporal localized sports actions, coined as MultiSports. We first analyze the important ingredients of constructing a realistic and challenging dataset for spatio-temporal action detection by proposing three criteria: (1) multi-person scenes and motion dependent identification, (2) with well-defined boundaries, (3) relatively fine-grained classes of high complexity. Based on these guidelines, we build the dataset of MultiSports v1.0 by selecting 4 sports classes, collecting 3200 video clips, and annotating 37701 action instances with 902k bounding boxes. Our datasets are characterized with important properties of high diversity, dense annotation, and high quality. Our MultiSports, with its realistic setting and detailed annotations, exposes the intrinsic challenges of spatio-temporal action detection. To benchmark this, we adapt several baseline methods to our dataset and give an in-depth analysis on the action detection results in our dataset. We hope our MultiSports can serve as a standard benchmark for spatio-temporal action detection in the future. Our dataset website is at https://deeperaction.github.io/multisports/."}

By analyzing the literature, we found that current methods are either accurate or fast but not both which limits their usability in real world applications. To get the best of both aspects, we propose to mitigate the common shortcomings by following four design principles: decoupling the OOD detection from the segmentation task, observing the entire segmentation network instead of just its output, generating training data for the OOD detector by leveraging blind spots in the segmentation network and focusing the generated data on localized regions in the image to simulate OOD objects. Our main contribution is a new OOD detection architecture called ObsNet associated with a dedicated training scheme based on Local Adversarial Attacks (LAA). We validate the soundness of our approach across numerous ablation studies. We also show it obtains top performances both in speed and accuracy when compared to ten recent methods of the literature on three different datasets."}

Recent methods have tried to address this problem either by using reinforcement learning, which is difficult to train, or by uncertainty maps, which are task-specific and can only be implemented for dense prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose the Glimpse-Attend-and-Explore model which: (a) employs self-attention to guide the visual exploration instead of task-specific uncertainty maps; (b) can be used for both dense and sparse prediction tasks; and (c) uses a contrastive stream to further improve the representations learned. Unlike previous works, we show the application of our model on multiple tasks like reconstruction, segmentation and classification. Our model provides encouraging results against baseline while being less dependent on dataset bias in driving the exploration. We further perform an ablation study to investigate the features and attention learned by our model.

Solving this task for composite scenes (such as object stacks) is challenging: occluded areas are not only ambiguous in shape but also in instance segmentation; multiple decompositions could be valid. We observe that physics constrains decomposition as well as shape in occluded regions and hypothesise that a latent space learned from scenes built under physics simulation can serve as a prior to better predict shape and instances in occluded regions. To this end we propose SIMstack, a depth-conditioned Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), trained on a dataset of objects stacked under physics simulation. We formulate instance segmentation as a center voting task which allows for class-agnostic detection and doesn't require setting the maximum number of objects in the scene. At test time, our model can generate 3D shape and instance segmentation from a single depth view, probabilistically sampling proposals for the occluded region from the learned latent space. We argue that this method has practical applications in providing robots some of the ability humans have to make rapid intuitive inferences of partially observed scenes. We demonstrate an application for precise (non-disruptive) object grasping of unknown objects from a single depth view."}

The task of inverting an image into its corresponding latent code of the trained GAN is of utmost importance as it allows for the manipulation of real images, leveraging the rich semantics learned by the network. Recognizing the limitations of current inversion approaches, in this work we present a novel inversion scheme that extends current encoder-based inversion methods by introducing an iterative refinement mechanism. Instead of directly predicting the latent code of a given real image using a single pass, the encoder is tasked with predicting a residual with respect to the current estimate of the inverted latent code in a self-correcting manner. Our residual-based encoder, named ReStyle, attains improved accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art encoder-based methods with a negligible increase in inference time. We analyze the behavior of ReStyle to gain valuable insights into its iterative nature. We then evaluate the performance of our residual encoder and analyze its robustness compared to optimization-based inversion and state-of-the-art encoders."}

Existing approaches use images of unexpected objects from external datasets or require additional training (e.g., retraining segmentation networks or training an extra network), which necessitate a non-trivial amount of labor intensity or lengthy inference time. One possible alternative is to use prediction scores of a pre-trained network such as the max logits (i.e., maximum values among classes before the final softmax layer) for detecting such objects. However, the distribution of max logits of each predicted class is significantly different from each other, which degrades the performance of identifying unexpected objects in urban-scene segmentation. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach that standardizes the max logits in order to align the different distributions and reflect the relative meanings of max logits within each predicted class. Moreover, we consider the local regions from two different perspectives based on the intuition that neighboring pixels share similar semantic information. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not utilize any external datasets or require additional training, which makes our method widely applicable to existing pre-trained segmentation models. Such a straightforward approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available Fishyscapes Lost & Found leaderboard with a large margin.

We present an input transformation strategy based on the Gegenbauer polynomials which previously showed theoretical advantages over the Fourier basis. We conduct experiments that show our Gegenbauer-based design combined with sinusoidal activation functions leads to a better light field reconstruction quality than a variety of network designs, including those with Fourier-inspired techniques introduced by prior works. Moreover, our SInusoidal Gegenbauer NETwork, or SIGNET, can represent light field scenes more compactly than the state-of-the-art compression methods while maintaining a comparable reconstruction quality. SIGNET also innately allows random access to encoded light field pixels due to its functional design.

Existing vanishing point detection methods often need to trade off between robustness, precision, and inference speed. In this paper, we introduce VaPiD, a novel neural network-based rapid Vanishing Point Detector that achieves unprecedented efficiency with learned vanishing point optimizers. The core of our method contains two components: a vanishing point proposal network that gives a set of vanishing point proposals as coarse estimations; and a neural vanishing point optimizer that iteratively optimizes the positions of the vanishing point proposals to achieve high-precision levels. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method provides competitive, if not better, performance as compared to the previous state-of-the-art vanishing point detection approaches, while being significantly faster."}

However, learning prototypes online from streaming data proves a challenging endeavor as they rapidly become outdated, caused by an ever-changing parameter space during the learning process. Additionally, continual learning does not assume the data stream to be stationary, typically resulting in catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. As a first, we introduce a system addressing both problems, where prototypes evolve continually in a shared latent space, enabling learning and prediction at any point in time. To facilitate learning, a novel objective function synchronizes the latent space with the continually evolving prototypes. In contrast to the major body of work in continual learning, data streams are processed in an online fashion without task information and can be highly imbalanced, for which we propose an efficient memory scheme. As an additional contribution, we propose the learner-evaluator framework that i) generalizes existing paradigms in continual learning, ii) introduces data incremental learning, and iii) models the bridge between continual learning and concept drift. We obtain state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin on eight benchmarks, including three highly imbalanced data streams. Code is publicly available."}

While the mainstream technique seeks to completely filter out the OOD samples for semi-supervised learning (SSL), we propose a novel training mechanism that could effectively exploit the presence of OOD data for enhanced feature learning while avoiding its adverse impact on the SSL. We achieve this goal by first introducing a warm-up training that leverages all the unlabeled data, including both the in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. Specifically, we perform a pretext task that enforces our feature extractor to obtain a high-level semantic understanding of the training images, leading to more discriminative features that can benefit the downstream tasks. Since the OOD samples are inevitably detrimental to SSL, we propose a novel cross-modal matching strategy to detect OOD samples. Instead of directly applying binary classification, we train the network to predict whether the data sample is matched to an assigned one-hot class label. The appeal of the proposed cross-modal matching over binary classification is the ability to generate a compatible feature space that aligns with the core classification task. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially lifts the performance on open-set SSL and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin."}

Existing works use a network to learn point-wise weights for weighted least squares surface fitting to estimate the normals, which has difficulty in finding accurate normals in complex regions or containing noisy points. By analyzing the step of weighted least squares surface fitting, we find that it is hard to determine the polynomial order of the fitting surface and the fitting surface is sensitive to outliers. To address these problems, we propose a simple yet effective solution that adds an additional offset prediction to improve the quality of normal estimation. Furthermore, in order to take advantage of points from different neighborhood sizes, a novel Cascaded Scale Aggregation layer is proposed to help the network predict more accurate point-wise offsets and weights.

The effective loss functions play an important role for FR. In this paper, we observe that a majority of loss functions, including the widespread triplet loss and softmax-based cross-entropy loss, embed inter-class (negative) similarity s_n and intra-class (positive) similarity s_p into similarity pairs and optimize to reduce (s_n - s_p) in the training process. However, in the verification process, existing metrics directly take the absolute similarity between two features as the confidence of belonging to the same identity, which inevitably causes a gap between the training and verification process. To bridge the gap, we propose a new metric called Discrepancy Alignment Metric (DAM) for verification, which introduces the Local Inter-class Discrepancy (LID) for each face image to normalize the absolute similarity score. To estimate the LID of each face image in the verification process, we propose two types of LID Estimation (LIDE) methods, which are reference-based and learning-based estimation methods, respectively. The proposed DAM is plug-and-play and can be easily applied to the most existing methods.

Specifically, this is the first effort to assign mixed quantization schemes and multiple precisions within layers -- among rows of the DNN weight matrix, for simplified operations in hardware inference, while preserving accuracy. Furthermore, this paper makes a different observation from the prior work that the quantization error does not necessarily exhibit the layer-wise sensitivity, and actually can be mitigated as long as a certain portion of the weights in every layer are in higher precisions. This observation enables layer-wise uniformality in the hardware implementation towards guaranteed inference acceleration, while still enjoying row-wise flexibility of mixed schemes and multiple precisions to boost accuracy. The candidates of schemes and precisions are derived practically and effectively with a highly hardware-informative strategy to reduce the problem search space. With the offline determined ratio of different quantization schemes and precisions for all the layers, the RMSMP quantization algorithm uses Hessian and variance based method to effectively assign schemes and precisions for each row.

However, the observed elements may be of different levels of importance. Some information may be irrelevant or even distracting to the forecasting in certain situations. To address this issue, we propose a generic motion forecasting framework (named RAIN) with dynamic key information selection and ranking based on a hybrid attention mechanism. The general framework is instantiated to handle multi-agent trajectory prediction and human motion forecasting tasks, respectively. In the former task, the model learns to recognize the relations between agents with a graph representation and to determine their relative significance. In the latter task, the model learns to capture the temporal proximity and dependency in long-term human motions. We also propose an effective double-stage training pipeline with an alternating training strategy to optimize the parameters in different modules of the framework. We validate the framework on both synthetic simulations and motion forecasting benchmarks in different domains, demonstrating that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance but also provides interpretable and reasonable hybrid attention weights."}

In this work, we propose an approach for incorporating the shape-aware 2D/3D constraints into the 3D detection framework. Specifically, we employ the deep neural network to learn distinguished 2D keypoints in the 2D image domain and regress their corresponding 3D coordinates in the local 3D object coordinate first. Then the 2D/3D geometric constraints are built by these correspondences for each object to boost the detection performance. For generating the ground truth of 2D/3D keypoints, an automatic model-fitting approach has been proposed by fitting the deformed 3D object model and the object mask in the 2D image. The proposed framework has been verified on the public KITTI dataset and the experimental results demonstrate that by using additional geometrical constraints the detection performance has been significantly improved as compared to the baseline method. More importantly, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with real time. Data and code will be available at https://github.com/zongdai/AutoShape"}

However, optimal hyper-parameter selection is critical to achieving high accuracy and avoiding negative transfer. Supervised hyper-parameter validation is not possible without labeled target data, which raises the question: How can we validate unsupervised adaptation techniques in a realistic way? We first empirically analyze existing criteria and demonstrate that they are not very effective for tuning hyper-parameters. Intuitively, a well-trained source classifier should embed target samples of the same class nearby, forming dense neighborhoods in feature space. Based on this assumption, we propose a novel unsupervised validation criterion that measures the density of soft neighborhoods by computing the entropy of the similarity distribution between points. Our criterion is simpler than competing validation methods, yet more effective; it can tune hyper-parameters and the number of training iterations in both image classification and semantic segmentation models."}

In this paper, we propose a novel method for panoramic 3D scene understanding which recovers the 3D room layout and the shape, pose, position, and semantic category for each object from a single full-view panorama image. In order to fully utilize the rich context information, we design a novel graph neural network based context model to predict the relationship among objects and room layout, and a differentiable relationship-based optimization module to optimize object arrangement with well-designed objective functions on-the-fly. Realizing the existing data are either with incomplete ground truth or overly-simplified scene, we present a new synthetic dataset with good diversity in room layout and furniture placement, and realistic image quality for total panoramic 3D scene understanding.

Our method combines three neural networks: An encoder, a scoring network, and a decoder. The encoder extracts image features and predicts a neural activation map for each face looked at by a human observer. A neural scoring network compares the human and neural attention and predicts a relevance score for each extracted image feature. Finally, image features are aggregated into a single feature vector as a linear combination of all features weighted by relevance which a decoder decodes into the final photofit. We train the neural scoring network on a novel dataset containing gaze data of 19 participants looking at collages of synthetic faces. We show that our method significantly outperforms a mean baseline predictor and report on a human study that shows that we can decode photofits that are visually plausible and close to the observer's mental image."}

Yet, the dark side of such deepfakes, the malicious use of generated media, raises concerns about visual misinformation. While existing research work on deepfake detection demonstrates high accuracy, it is subject to advances in generation techniques and adversarial iterations on detection countermeasure techniques. Thus, we seek a proactive and sustainable solution on deepfake detection, that is agnostic to the evolution of generative models, by introducing artificial fingerprints into the models. Our approach is simple and effective. We first embed artificial fingerprints into training data, then validate a surprising discovery on the transferability of such fingerprints from training data to generative models, which in turn appears in the generated deepfakes. Experiments show that our fingerprinting solution (1) holds for a variety of cutting-edge generative models, (2) leads to a negligible side effect on generation quality, (3) stays robust against image-level and model-level perturbations, (4) stays hard to be detected by adversaries, and (5) converts deepfake detection and attribution into trivial tasks and outperforms the recent state-of-the-art baselines. Our solution closes the responsibility loop between publishing pre-trained generative model inventions and their possible misuses, which makes it independent of the current arms race."}

In detail, each keypoint is explicitly embedded as a token to simultaneously learn constraint relationships and appearance cues from images. Extensive experiments show that the small and large TokenPose models are on par with state-of-the-art CNN-based counterparts while being more lightweight.

We propose a novel compositional learning framework that decouples interaction labels into separate action and object scores that incorporate the spatial compatibility between the two components. We combine these scores to efficiently recognize seen and unseen interactions. However, learning action-object spatial relations, in principle, requires bounding-box annotations, which are costly to gather. Moreover, it is not clear how to generalize spatial relations to unseen interactions. We address these challenges by developing a cross-attention mechanism that localizes objects from action locations and vice versa by predicting displacements between them, referred to as relational directions. During training, we estimate the relational directions as ones maximizing the scores of ground-truth interactions that guide predictions toward compatible action-object regions. By extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of our framework, where we improve the state of the art by 2.6% mAP score and 5.8% recall score on HICO and Visual Genome datasets, respectively.

Previous methods extract all potential matching pairs of pot sherds and considers them simultaneously to search for an optimal global pot configuration. In this work, we empirically show such global approach greatly suffers from false positive matches between sherds inflicted by indistinctive sharp fracture surfaces in pot fragments. To mitigate this problem, we take inspirations from the field of structure-from-motion (SfM), where many pipelines have matured in reconstructing a 3D scene from multiple images. Motivated by the success of the incremental approach in robust SfM, we present an efficient reassembly method for axially symmetric pots based on iterative registration of one sherd at a time. Our method goes beyond replicating incremental SfM and addresses indistinguishable false matches by embracing beam search to explore multitudes of registration possibilities. Additionally, we utilize multiple roots in each step to allow simultaneous reassembly of multiple pots. The proposed approach shows above 80% reassembly accuracy on a dataset of real 80 fragments mixed from 5 pots, pushing the state-of-the-art and paving the way towards the goal of large-scale pot reassembly.

The GREW dataset is constructed from natural videos, which contains hundreds of cameras and thousands of hours streams in open systems. With tremendous manual annotations, the GREW consists of 26K identities and 128K sequences with rich attributes for unconstrained gait recognition. Moreover, we add a distractor set of over 233K sequences, making it more suitable for real-world applications. Compared with prevailing predefined cross-view datasets, the GREW has diverse and practical view variations, as well as more natural challenging factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale dataset for gait recognition in the wild. Equipped with this benchmark, we dissect the unconstrained gait recognition problem. Representative appearance-based and model-based methods are explored, and comprehensive baselines are established.

However, data acquisition in crowded public environments raises data privacy concerns -- we are not allowed to simply record and store data without the explicit consent of all participants. Furthermore, the annotation of such data for computer vision applications usually requires a substantial amount of manual effort, especially in the video domain. Labeling instances of pedestrians in highly crowded scenarios can be challenging even for human annotators and may introduce errors in the training data. In this paper, we study how we can advance different aspects of multi-person tracking using solely synthetic data. To this end, we generate MOTSynth, a large, highly diverse synthetic dataset for object detection and tracking using a rendering game engine. Our experiments show that MOTSynth can be used as a replacement for real data on tasks such as pedestrian detection, re-identification, segmentation, and tracking."}

Our main contribution is a principled approach that relies on the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to maximize a suitable objective function efficiently despite the complexity of the problem. Like previous work, we first project the input point cloud to a top view to create a density map and extract room proposals from it. Our method selects and optimizes the polygonal shapes of these room proposals jointly to fit the density map and outputs an accurate vectorized floor map even for large complex scenes. To do this, we adapted MCTS, an algorithm originally designed to learn to play games, to select the room proposals by maximizing an objective function combining the fitness with the density map as predicted by a deep network and regularizing terms on the room shapes. We also introduce a refinement step to MCTS that adjusts the shape of the room proposals. For this step, we propose a novel differentiable method for rendering the polygonal shapes of these proposals. We evaluate our method on the recent and challenging Structured3D and Floor-SP datasets and show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art, without imposing any hard constraints nor assumptions on the floor plan configurations."}

Our main contribution is the introduction of a novel loss formulation, which jointly enhances the discriminability of latent embeddings and robustness of the output temporal class activations with respect to foreground-background noise caused by weak supervision. The proposed formulation comprises a discriminative and a denoising loss term for enhancing temporal action localization. The discriminative term incorporates a classification loss and utilizes a top-down attention mechanism to enhance the separability of latent foreground-background embeddings. The denoising loss term explicitly addresses the foreground-background noise in class activations by simultaneously maximizing intra-video and inter-video mutual information using a bottom-up attention mechanism. As a result, activations in the foreground regions are emphasized whereas those in the background regions are suppressed, thereby leading to more robust predictions. Comprehensive experiments are performed on multiple benchmarks, including THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2. Our D2-Net performs favorably in comparison to the existing methods on all datasets, achieving gains as high as 2.3% in terms of mAP at IoU=0.5 on THUMOS14.

(1) Shadow brush: artists can draw scribbles to coarsely indicate the areas inside or outside their wanted shadows, and the application will generate the shadows in real-time. (2) Shadow boundary brush: this brush can precisely control the boundary of any specific shadow. (3) Global shadow generator: this tool can estimate the global shadow direction from input brush scribbles, and then consistently propagate local shadows to the entire image. These three tools can not only speed up the shadow drawing process (by 3.1 times as experiments validate), but also allow for the flexibility to achieve various shadow effects and facilitate richer artistic creations. To this end, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a collected large-scale dataset of both real and synthesized data, and especially, we collect 1670 shadow samples drawn by real artists. Both qualitative analysis and user study show that our approach can generate high-quality shadows that are practically usable in the daily works of digital painting artists.

Since both of these internal phases are computationally expensive, CapsNets have not found wider use. Existing variations of CapsNets mainly focus on performance comparison with the original CapsNet, and have not outperformed CNN-based models on complex tasks. To address the limitations of the existing CapsNet structures, we propose a novel Prediction-Tuning Capsule Network (PT-CapsNet), and also introduce fully connected PT-Capsules (FC-PT-Caps) and locally connected PT-Capsules (LC-PT-Caps). Different from existing CapsNet structures, our proposed model (i) allows the use of capsules for more difficult vision tasks and provides wider applicability; and (ii) provides better than or comparable performance to CNN-based baselines on these complex tasks.

Considering large-scale tabular data in online and offline documents, automatic table recognition has attracted increasing attention from the document analysis community. Though human can easily understand the structure of tables, it remains a challenge for machines to understand that, especially due to a variety of different table layouts and styles. Existing methods usually model a table as either the markup sequence or the adjacency matrix between different table cells, failing to address the importance of the logical location of table cells, e.g., a cell is located in the first row and the second column of the table. In this paper, we reformulate the problem of table structure recognition as the table graph reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end trainable table graph reconstruction network (TGRNet) for table structure recognition. Specifically, the proposed method has two main branches, a cell detection branch and a cell logical location branch, to jointly predict the spatial location and the logical location of different cells. Experimental results on three popular table recognition datasets and a new dataset with table graph annotations (TableGraph-350K) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TGRNet for table structure recognition.

We found that two factors, sparse connectivity and dynamic activation function, are effective to improve the accuracy. The former avoids the significant reduction of network width, while the latter mitigates the detriment of reduction in network depth. Technically, we propose micro-factorized convolution, which factorizes a convolution matrix into low rank matrices, to integrate sparse connectivity into convolution. We also present a new dynamic activation function, named Dynamic Shift Max, to improve the non-linearity via maxing out multiple dynamic fusions between an input feature map and its circular channel shift. Building upon these two new operators, we arrive at a family of networks, named MicroNet, that achieves significant performance gains over the state of the art in the low FLOP regime. For instance, under the constraint of 12M FLOPs, MicroNet achieves 59.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification, outperforming MobileNetV3 by 9.6%.

A pyramidal \"output\" representation consists of coarse-to-fine levels, where each level is \"specialize\" in a different class distribution (e.g., more stuff than things classes at coarser levels). Two types of pyramidal outputs (i.e., unity and semantic pyramid) are \"fused\" into the final semantic output, where the unity pyramid indicates unity-cells (i.e., all pixels in such cell share the same semantic label). The process ensures parsimony by predicting a relatively small number of labels for unity-cells (e.g., a large cell of grass) to build the final semantic output. In addition to the \"output\" representation, we design a coarse-to-fine contextual module to aggregate the \"features\" representation from different levels. We validate the effectiveness of each key module in our method through comprehensive ablation studies. Finally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used semantic segmentation datasets---ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Pascal-Context."}

Most existing learning-based methods use supervised learning and require a large number of paired images (shadow and corresponding non-shadow images) for training. A recent unsupervised method, Mask-ShadowGAN, addresses this limitation. However, it requires a binary mask to represent shadow regions, making it inapplicable to soft shadows. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain-classifier guided shadow removal network, DC-ShadowNet. Specifically, we propose to integrate a shadow/shadow-free domain classifier into a generator and its discriminator, enabling them to focus on shadow regions. To train our network, we introduce novel losses based on physics-based shadow-free chromaticity, shadow-robust perceptual features, and boundary smoothness. Moreover, we show that our network being unsupervised can be used for test-time training that further improves the results. Our experiments show that all these novel components allow our method to handle soft shadows, and also to perform better on hard shadows both quantitatively and qualitatively than the existing state-of-the-art shadow removal methods."}

Our system renders photorealistic novel views of the actor and her motion from arbitrary virtual camera locations. Rendering full-body avatars from such egocentric images come with unique challenges due to the top-down view and large distortions. We tackle these challenges by decomposing the rendering process into several steps, including texture synthesis, pose construction, and neural image translation. For texture synthesis, we propose Ego-DPNet, a neural network that infers dense correspondences between the input fisheye images and an underlying parametric body model, and to extract textures from egocentric inputs. In addition, to encode dynamic appearances, our approach also learns an implicit texture stack that captures detailed appearance variation across poses and viewpoints. For correct pose generation, we first estimate body pose from the egocentric view using a parametric model. We then synthesize an external free-viewpoint pose image by projecting the parametric model to the user-specified target viewpoint. We next combine the target pose image and the textures into a combined feature image, which is transformed into the output color image using a neural image translation network. Experimental evaluations show that EgoRenderer is capable of generating realistic free-viewpoint avatars of a person wearing an egocentric camera. Comparisons to several baselines demonstrate the advantages of our approach."}

Self-supervised monocular depth estimation uses geometric constraints derived from the camera measurement model in order to measure depth from monocular video sequences only.

To alleviate this issue, we introduce two novel training techniques called frequency dropping (F-Drop) and frequency matching (F-Match). The key idea of F-Drop is to filter out unnecessary high-frequency components from the input images of the discriminators. This simple modification prevents the discriminators from being confused by perturbations of the high-frequency components. In addition, F-Drop makes the GANs focus on fitting in the low-frequency domain, in which there are the dominant components of natural images. F-Match minimizes the difference between real and fake images in the frequency domain for generating more realistic images. F-Match is implemented as a regularization term in the objective functions of the generators; it penalizes the batch mean error in the frequency domain. F-Match helps the generators to fit in the high-frequency domain filtered out by F-Drop to the real image. We experimentally demonstrate that the combination of F-Drop and F-Match improves the generative performance of GANs in both the frequency and spatial domain on multiple image benchmarks."}

While the standard homogeneous reconstruction task aims to recover a single static structure, recently-proposed neural and non-neural methods can reconstruct distributions of structures, thereby enabling the study of protein complexes that possess intrinsic structural or conformational heterogeneity. These heterogeneous reconstruction methods, however, require fixed image poses, which are typically estimated from an upstream homogeneous reconstruction and are not guaranteed to be accurate under highly heterogeneous conditions. In this work we describe cryoDRGN2, an ab initio reconstruction algorithm, which can jointly estimate image poses and learn a neural model of a distribution of 3D structures on real heterogeneous cryo-EM data. To achieve this, we adapt search algorithms from the traditional cryo-EM literature, and describe the optimizations and design choices required to make such a search procedure computationally tractable in the neural model setting. We show that cryoDRGN2 is robust to the high noise levels of real cryo-EM images, trains faster than earlier neural methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real cryo-EM datasets."}

Visual panels are composed of clip-art objects with specific attributes enabling a broad range of creative expression. Using AESOP, we propose foundational storytelling tasks that are generative variants of story cloze tests, to better measure the creative and causal reasoning ability required for visual storytelling. We further develop a generalized story completion framework that models stories as the co-evolution of visual and textual concepts. We benchmark the proposed approach with human baselines and evaluate using comprehensive qualitative and quantitative metrics.

Recently, there have been attempts not only to generate better visual explanations, but also to improve classification performance using visual explanations. However, previous works still have their own drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, LFI-CAM***(Learning Feature Importance Class Activation Mapping), which is trainable for image classification and visual explanation in an end-to-end manner. LFI-CAM generates attention map for visual explanation during forward propagation, and simultaneously uses attention map to improve classification performance through the attention mechanism. Feature Importance Network (FIN) focuses on learning the feature importance instead of directly learning the attention map to obtain a more reliable and consistent attention map. We confirmed that LFI-CAM is optimized not only by learning the feature importance but also by enhancing the backbone feature representation to focus more on important features of the input image. Experiments show that LFI-CAM outperforms baseline models' accuracy on classification tasks as well as significantly improves on previous works in terms of attention map quality and stability over different hyper-parameters."}

In this paper, we propose a new model, named InstanceRefer, to achieve a superior 3D visual grounding through the grounding-by-matching strategy. In practice, our model first predicts the target category from the language descriptions using a simple language classification model. Then based on the category, our model sifts out a small number of instance candidates (usually less than 20) from the panoptic segmentation on point clouds. Thus, the non-trivial 3D visual grounding task has been effectively re-formulated as a simplified instance-matching problem, considering that instance-level candidates are more rational than the redundant 3D object proposals. Subsequently, for each candidate, we perform the multi-level contextual inference, i.e., referring from instance attribute perception, instance-to-instance relation perception, and instance-to-background global localization perception, respectively. Eventually, the most relevant candidate is selected and localized by ranking confidence scores, which are obtained by the cooperative holistic visual-language feature matching. Experiments confirm that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-arts on ScanRefer online benchmark (ranked 1st place) and Nr3D/Sr3D datasets."}

A powerful backbone could still achieve sub-optimal performance with a weak saliency head and vice versa. Moreover, the balance between model performance and inference latency poses a great challenge to model design, especially when considering different deployment scenarios. Considering all components in an integral neural architecture search (iNAS) space, we propose a flexible device-aware search scheme that only trains the SOD model once and quickly finds high-performance but low-latency models on multiple devices. An evolution search with latency-group sampling (LGS) is proposed to explore the entire latency area of our enlarged search space. Models searched by iNAS achieve similar performance with SOTA methods but reduce the 3.8x, 3.3x, 2.6x, 1.9x latency on Huawei Nova6 SE, Intel Core CPU, the Jetson Nano, and Nvidia Titan Xp.

Current approaches generally rely on the points or voxels of interest for RoI feature extraction on the second stage, but cannot effectively handle the sparsity and non-uniform distribution of those points, and this may result in failures in detecting objects that are far away. To resolve the problems, we propose a novel second-stage module, named pyramid RoI head, to adaptively learn the features from the sparse points of interest. The pyramid RoI head consists of three key components. Firstly, we propose the RoI-grid Pyramid, which addresses the sparsity problem by extensively collecting points of interest for each RoI in a pyramid manner. Secondly, we propose RoI-grid Attention, a new operation that can encode richer information from sparse points by incorporating conventional attention-based and graph-based point operators into a unified formulation. Thirdly, we propose the Density-Aware Radius Prediction (DARP) module, which can adapt to different point density levels by dynamically adjusting the focusing range of RoIs. Combining the three components, our pyramid RoI head is robust to the sparse and imbalanced circumstances, and can be applied upon various 3D backbones to consistently boost the detection performance. Extensive experiments show that Pyramid R-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D detection models by a large margin on both the KITTI dataset and the Waymo Open dataset."}

However, most of the existing SSLs neglected the geometric shape constraint in object, leading to unsatisfactory boundary and non-smooth of object. In this paper, we propose a novel boundary-aware semi-supervised medical image segmentation network, named Graph-BAS3Net, which incorporates the boundary information and learns duality constraints between semantics and geometrics in the graph domain. Specifically, the proposed method consists of two components: a multi-task learning framework BAS3Net and a graph-based cross-task module BGCM. The BAS3Net improves the existing GAN-based SSL by adding a boundary detection task, which encodes richer features of object shape and surface. Moreover, the BGCM further explores the co-occurrence relations between the semantics segmentation and boundary detection task, so that the network learns stronger semantic and geometric correspondences from both labeled and unlabeled data.

However, while a large body of work has focused on learning visual correspondences at the pixel-level, few approaches have emerged to learn correspondence at the level of line enclosures (segments) that naturally occur in hand-drawn animation. Exploiting this structure in animation has numerous benefits: it avoids the memory complexity of pixel attention over high resolution images and enables the use of real-world animation datasets that contain correspondence information at the level of per-segment colors. To that end, we propose the Animation Transformer (AnT) which uses a Transformer-based architecture to learn the spatial and visual relationships between segments across a sequence of images. By leveraging a forward match loss and a cycle consistency loss our approach attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art pixel approaches on challenging datasets from real animation productions that lack ground-truth correspondence labels."}

Inspired by this, in this paper, we study how to learn multi-scale feature representations in transformer models for image classification. To this end, we propose a dual-branch transformer to combine image patches (i.e., tokens in a transformer) of different sizes to produce stronger image features. Our approach processes small-patch and large-patch tokens with two separate branches of different computational complexity and these tokens are then fused purely by attention multiple times to complement each other. Furthermore, to reduce computation, we develop a simple yet effective token fusion module based on cross attention, which uses a single token for each branch as a query to exchange information with other branches. Our proposed cross-attention only requires linear time for both computational and memory complexity instead of quadratic time otherwise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs better than or on par with several concurrent works on vision transformer, in addition to efficient CNN models. For example, on the ImageNet1K dataset, with some architectural changes, our approach outperforms the recent DeiT by a large margin of 2% with a small to moderate increase in FLOPs and model parameters.

In some target problem domains, there are not many data samples available, which could significantly hinder the learning process. While data from similar domains may be leveraged to help through domain adaptation, obtaining high-quality labeled data for those source domains themselves could be difficult or costly. To address such challenges on data insufficiency for classification problem in a target domain, we propose a weak adaptation learning (WAL) approach that leverages unlabeled data from a similar source domain, a low-cost weak annotator that produces labels based on task-specific heuristics, labeling rules, or other methods (albeit with inaccuracy), and a small amount of labeled data in the target domain. Our approach first conducts a theoretical analysis on the error bound of the trained classifier with respect to the data quantity and the performance of the weak annotator, and then introduces a multi-stage weak adaptation learning method to learn an accurate classifier by lowering the error bound. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in learning an accurate classifier with limited labeled data in the target domain and unlabeled data in the source domain."}

Though 2D layout generation for a single story has been widely studied, there is no developed method for multi-story buildings. This paper focuses on volumetric design generation conditioned on an input program graph. Instead of outputting dense 3D voxels, we propose a new 3D representation named voxel graph that is both compact and expressive for building geometries. Our generator is a cross-modal graph neural network that uses a pointer mechanism to connect the input program graph and the output voxel graph, and the whole pipeline is trained using the adversarial framework. The generated designs are evaluated qualitatively by a user study and quantitatively using three metrics: quality, diversity, and connectivity accuracy. We show that our model generates realistic 3D volumetric designs and outperforms previous methods and baselines."}

Recent papers have ported these methods from still images to videos and found that leveraging both audio and video signals yields strong gains; however, they did not find that spatial augmentations such as cropping, which are very important for still images, work as well for videos. In this paper, we improve these formulations in two ways unique to the spatio-temporal aspect of videos. First, for space, we show that spatial augmentations such as cropping do work well for videos too, but that previous implementations, due to the high processing and memory cost, could not do this at a scale sufficient for it to work well. To address this issue, we first introduce Feature Crop, a method to simulate such augmentations much more efficiently directly in feature space. Second, we show that as opposed to naive average pooling, the use of transformer-based attention improves performance significantly, and is well suited for processing feature crops. Combining both of our discoveries into a new method, Space-time Crop & Attend (STiCA) we achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple video-representation learning benchmarks. In particular, we achieve new state-of-the-art accuracies of 67.0% on HMDB-51 and 93.1% on UCF-101 when pre-training on Kinetics-400."}

This paper presents RDA, a robust domain adaptation technique that introduces adversarial attacking to mitigate overfitting in UDA. We achieve robust domain adaptation by a novel Fourier adversarial attacking (FAA) method that allows large magnitude of perturbation noises but has minimal modification of image semantics, the former is critical to the effectiveness of its generated adversarial samples due to the existence of domain gaps. Specifically, FAA decomposes images into multiple frequency components (FCs) and generates adversarial samples by just perturbating certain FCs that capture little semantic information. With FAA-generated samples, the training can continue the random walk and drift into an area with a flat loss landscape, leading to more robust domain adaptation. Extensive experiments over multiple domain adaptation tasks show that RDA can work with different computer vision tasks with superior performance."}

DETR, the state-of-the-art model among them, is composed of three sub-modules, i.e., a CNN-based backbone and paired transformer encoder-decoder. The CNN is applied to extract local features and the transformer is used to capture global contexts. This pipeline, however, is not concise enough. In this paper, we propose WB-DETR (DETR-based detector Without Backbone) to prove that the reliance on CNN features extraction for a transformer-based detector is not necessary. Unlike the original DETR, WB-DETR is composed of only an encoder and a decoder without CNN backbone. For an input image, WB-DETR serializes it directly to encode the local features into each individual token. To make up the deficiency of transformer in modeling local information, we design an LIE-T2T (local information enhancement tokens to token) module to enhance the internal information of tokens after unfolding. Experimental results demonstrate that WB-DETR, the first pure-transformer detector without CNN to our knowledge, yields on par accuracy and faster inference speed with only half number of parameters compared with DETR baseline."}

The main insight is that simply shrink-wrapping a planar mesh sheet onto the input image, consistent with the learned intermediate depth, captures underlying geometry sufficient to generate photorealistic unseen views with large viewpoint changes. To operationalize this, we propose a novel differentiable texture sampler that allows our wrapped mesh sheet to be textured and rendered differentiably into an image from a target viewpoint. Our approach is category-agnostic, end-to-end trainable without using any 3D supervision, and requires a single image at test time. We also explore a simple extension by stacking multiple layers of Worldsheets to better handle occlusions. Worldsheet consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on single-image view synthesis across several datasets.

To achieve a mapping between image views of objects and 3D shapes, we leverage CAD model priors from existing large-scale databases, and propose a novel approach towards constructing a joint embedding space between 2D images and 3D CAD models in a patch-wise fashion -- establishing correspondences between patches of an image view of an object and patches of CAD geometry. This enables part similarity reasoning for retrieving similar CADs to a new image view without exact matches in the database.  Our patch embedding provides more robust CAD retrieval for shape estimation in our end-to-end estimation of CAD model shape and pose for detected objects in a single input image. Experiments on in-the-wild, complex imagery from ScanNet show that our approach is more robust than state of the art in real-world scenarios without any exact CAD matches."}

However, the problem of missing certain modality images often happens in clinical practice, thus leading to severe segmentation performance degradation. In this work, we propose a Region-aware Fusion Network (RFNet) that is able to exploit different combinations of multi-modal data adaptively and effectively for tumor segmentation. Considering different modalities are sensitive to different brain tumor regions, we design a Region-aware Fusion Module (RFM) in RFNet to conduct modal feature fusion from available image modalities according to disparate regions. Benefiting from RFM, RFNet can adaptively segment tumor regions from an incomplete set of multi-modal images by effectively aggregating modal features. Furthermore, we also develop a segmentation-based regularizer to prevent RFNet from the insufficient and unbalanced training caused by the incomplete multi-modal data. Specifically, apart from obtaining segmentation results from fused modal features, we also segment each image modality individually from the corresponding encoded features. In this manner, each modal encoder is forced to learn discriminative features, thus improving the representation ability of the fused features. Remarkably, extensive experiments on BRATS2020, BRATS2018 and BRATS2015 datasets demonstrate that our RFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly."}

Scene flow inherently separates every scene into multiple moving agents and a large class of points following a single rigid sensor motion. However, existing methods do not leverage this property of the data in their self-supervised training routines which could improve and stabilize flow predictions. Based on the discrepancy between a robust rigid ego-motion estimate and a raw flow prediction, we generate a self-supervised motion segmentation signal. The predicted motion segmentation, in turn, is used by our algorithm to attend to stationary points for aggregation of motion information in static parts of the scene. We learn our model end-to-end by backpropagating gradients through Kabsch's algorithm and demonstrate that this leads to accurate ego-motion which in turn improves the scene flow estimate. Using our method, we show state-of-the-art results across multiple scene flow metrics for different real-world datasets, showcasing the robustness and generalizability of this approach. We further analyze the performance gain when performing joint motion segmentation and scene flow in an ablation study. We also present a novel network architecture for 3D LiDAR scene flow which is capable of handling an order of magnitude more points during training than previously possible."}

Previous works along this line mainly focus on reducing the number of architectures required to fit the predictor. In this work, we tackle this challenge from a different perspective - improve search efficiency by cutting down the computation budget of architecture training. We propose NOn-uniform Successive Halving (NOSH), a hierarchical scheduling algorithm that terminates the training of underperforming architectures early to avoid wasting budget. To effectively leverage the non-uniform supervision signals produced by NOSH, we formulate predictor-based architecture search as learning to rank with pairwise comparisons. The resulting method - RANK-NOSH, reduces the search budget by  5x while achieving competitive or even better performance than previous state-of-the-art predictor-based methods on various spaces and datasets."}

However, these methods are limited to adapt the specific types of object detectors and do not explore the cross-domain topological relations. In this paper, we first formulate DAOD as an open-set domain adaptation problem in which foregrounds (pixel or region) can be seen as the \"known class\", while backgrounds (pixel or region) are referred to as the \"unknown class\". To this end, we present a new and general perspective for DAOD named Dual Bipartite Graph Learning (DBGL), which captures the cross-domain interactions on both pixel-level and semantic-level via increasing the distinction between foregrounds and backgrounds and modeling the cross-domain dependencies among different semantic categories.

However, the performance gain of transformers is attained at a steep cost, requiring GPU years and hundreds of millions of samples for training. This excessive resource usage compensates for a misuse of transformers: Transformers densely model relationships between its inputs -- ideal for late stages of a neural network, when concepts are sparse and spatially-distant, but extremely inefficient for early stages of a network, when patterns are redundant and localized. To address these issues, we leverage the respective strengths of both operations, building convolution-transformer hybrids. Critically, in sharp contrast to pixel-space transformers, our Visual Transformer (VT) operates in a semantic token space, judiciously attending to different image parts based on context. Our VTs significantly outperforms baselines: On ImageNet, our VT-ResNets outperform convolution-only ResNet by 4.6 to 7 points and transformer-only ViT-B by 2.6 points with 2.5 times fewer FLOPs, 2.1 times fewer parameters. For semantic segmentation on LIP and COCO-stuff, VT-based feature pyramid networks (FPN) achieve 0.35 points higher mIoU while reducing the FPN module's FLOPs by 6.5x."}

Optimizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification tends to activate local discriminative regions while ignoring complete object extent, causing the partial activation issue. In this paper, we argue that partial activation is caused by the intrinsic characteristics of CNN, where the convolution operations produce local receptive fields and experience difficulty to capture long-range feature dependency among pixels. We introduce the token semantic coupled attention map (TS-CAM) to take full advantage of the self-attention mechanism in visual transformer for long-range dependency extraction. TS-CAM first splits an image into a sequence of patch tokens for spatial embedding, which produce attention maps of long-range visual dependency to avoid partial activation. TS-CAM then re-allocates category-related semantics for patch tokens, enabling each of them to be aware of object categories. TS-CAM finally couples the patch tokens with the semantic-agnostic attention map to achieve semantic-aware localization. Experiments on the ILSVRC/CUB-200-2011 datasets show that TS-CAM outperforms its CNN-CAM counterparts by7.1%/27.1%for WSOL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

The existing approaches focus on modeling the context from the perspective of the whole image, i.e., aggregating the image-level contextual information. Despite impressive, these methods weaken the significance of the pixel representations of the same category, i.e., the semantic-level contextual information. To address this, this paper proposes to augment the pixel representations by aggregating the image-level and semantic-level contextual information, respectively. First, an image-level context module is designed to capture the contextual information for each pixel in the whole image. Second, we aggregate the representations of the same category for each pixel where the category regions are learned under the supervision of the ground-truth segmentation. Third, we compute the similarities between each pixel representation and the image-level contextual information, the semantic-level contextual information, respectively. At last, a pixel representation is augmented by weighted aggregating both the image-level contextual information and the semantic-level contextual information with the similarities as the weights. Integrating the image-level and semantic-level context allows this paper to report state-of-the-art accuracy on four benchmarks, i.e., ADE20K, LIP, COCOStuff and Cityscapes."}

To detect and localize accurate 3D bounding boxes, LiDAR-based models can encode accurate object boundaries and surface normal directions from LiDAR point clouds. However, the detection results of stereo-based detectors are easily affected by the erroneous depth features due to the limitation of stereo matching. To solve the problem, we propose LIGA-Stereo (LiDAR Geometry Aware Stereo Detector) to learn stereo-based 3D detectors under the guidance of high-level geometry-aware representations of LiDAR-based detection models. In addition, we found existing voxel-based stereo detectors failed to learn semantic features effectively from indirect 3D supervisions.

Currently, lane detection relies on a huge amount of annotated images, which is a heavy burden. Active learning has been proposed to reduce annotation in many computer vision tasks, but no effort has been made for lane detection. Through experiments, we find that existing active learning methods perform poorly for lane detection, and the reasons are twofold. On one hand, most methods evaluate data uncertainties based on entropy, which is undesirable in lane detection because it encourages to select images with very few lanes or even no lane at all. On the other hand, existing methods are not aware of the noise of lane annotations, which is caused by heavy occlusion and unclear lane marks. In this paper, we build a novel knowledge distillation framework and evaluate the uncertainty of images based on the knowledge learnt by the student model. We show that the proposed uncertainty metric overcomes the above two problems. To reduce data redundancy, we explore the influence sets of image samples, and propose a new diversity metric for data selection. Finally we incorporate the uncertainty and diversity metrics, and develop a greedy algorithm for data selection. The experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art on the lane detection benchmarks.

To alleviate these problems, we first propose the joint training of architecture and quantization with a shared step size to acquire a large number of quantized models. Then a bit-inheritance scheme is introduced to transfer the quantized models to the lower bit, which further reduces the time cost and meanwhile improves the quantization accuracy. Equipped with this overall framework, dubbed as Once Quantization-Aware Training (OQAT), our searched model family, OQATNets, achieves a new state-of-the-art compared with various architectures under different bit-widths. In particular, OQAT-2bit-M achieves 61.6% ImageNet Top-1 accuracy, outperforming 2-bit counterpart MobileNetV3 by a large margin of 9% with 10% less computation cost. A series of quantization-friendly architectures are identified easily and extensive analysis can be made to summarize the interaction between quantization and neural architectures.

Besides the remarkable success, it is important to note that the heuristic matching network design relies heavily on expert experience. Moreover, we experimentally find that one sole matching operator is difficult to guarantee stable tracking in all challenging environments. Thus, in this work, we introduce six novel matching operators, namely Concatenation, Pointwise-Addition, Pairwise-Relation, FiLM, Simple-Transformer and Transductive-Guidance, to explore more feasibility on matching operator selection. The analyses reveal these operators' selective adaptability on different environment degradation types, which inspires us to combine them to explore complementary features. To this end, we propose binary channel manipulation (BCM) to search for the optimal combination of these operators. BCM determines to retrain or discard one operator by learning its contribution to other tracking steps. By inserting the learned matching networks to a strong baseline tracker Ocean, our model achieves favorable gains by 67.2 -> 71.4, 52.6 -> 58.3, 70.3 -> 76.0 AUC on OTB100, LaSOT, and TrackingNet, respectively. Notably, Our tracker runs at real-time speed of 50 / 100 FPS using PyTorch / TensorRT."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2021", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "TransVG", "Title": "End-to-End Visual Grounding With Transformers", "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a neat yet effective transformer-based framework for visual grounding, namely TransVG, to address the task of grounding a language query to the corresponding region onto an image. The state-of-the-art methods, including two-stage or one-stage ones, rely on a complex module with manually-designed mechanisms to perform the query reasoning and multi-modal fusion. However, the involvement of certain mechanisms in fusion module design, such as query decomposition and image scene graph, makes the models easily overfit to datasets with specific scenarios, and limits the plenitudinous interaction between the visual-linguistic context. To avoid this caveat, we propose to establish the multi-modal correspondence by leveraging transformers, and empirically show that the complex fusion modules (e.g., modular attention network, dynamic graph, and multi-modal tree) can be replaced by a simple stack of transformer encoder layers with higher performance. Moreover, we re-formulate the visual grounding as a direct coordinates regression problem and avoid making predictions out of a set of candidates (i.e., region proposals or anchor boxes). Extensive experiments are conducted on five widely used datasets, and a series of state-of-the-art records are set by our TransVG. We build the benchmark of transformer-based visual grounding framework and make the code available at https://github.com/djiajunustc/TransVG."}

Given the scarcity of domain-specific training data and the high diversity of image and language inputs, the generalization of VLN agents to unseen environments remains challenging. Recent methods explore pretraining to improve generalization, however, the use of generic image-caption datasets or existing small-scale VLN environments is suboptimal and results in limited improvements. In this work, we introduce BnB, a large-scale and diverse in-domain VLN dataset. We first collect image-caption (IC) pairs from hundreds of thousands of listings from online rental marketplaces. Using IC pairs we next propose automatic strategies to generate millions of VLN path-instruction (PI) pairs. We further propose a shuffling loss that improves the learning of temporal order inside PI pairs. We use BnB to pretrain our Airbert model that can be adapted to discriminative and generative settings and show that it outperforms state of the art for Room-to-Room (R2R) navigation and Remote Referring Expression (REVERIE) benchmarks. Moreover, our in-domain pretraining significantly increases performance on a challenging few-shot VLN evaluation, where we train the model only on VLN instructions from a few houses."}
