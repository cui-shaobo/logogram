At best, this leads to a loss of trust in digital content, but could potentially cause further harm by spreading false information or fake news. This paper examines the realism of state-of-the-art image manipulations, and how difficult it is to detect them, either automatically or by humans. To standardize the evaluation of detection methods, we propose an automated benchmark for facial manipulation detection. In particular, the benchmark is based on Deep-Fakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap and NeuralTextures as prominent representatives for facial manipulations at random compression level and size. The benchmark is publicly available and contains a hidden test set as well as a database of over 1.8 million manipulated images. This dataset is over an order of magnitude larger than comparable, publicly available, forgery datasets. Based on this data, we performed a thorough analysis of data-driven forgery detectors. We show that the use of additional domain-specific knowledge improves forgery detection to unprecedented accuracy, even in the presence of strong compression, and clearly outperforms human observers."}

Different from other keypoint based methods where a RANSAC procedure is usually needed, we implement the use of various deep neural network structures to establish an end-to-end trainable network. Our keypoint detector is trained through this end-to-end structure and enables the system to avoid the interference of dynamic objects, leverages the help of sufficiently salient features on stationary objects, and as a result, achieves high robustness. Rather than searching the corresponding points among existing points, the key contribution is that we innovatively generate them based on learned matching probabilities among a group of candidates, which can boost the registration accuracy. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of our approach using both the KITTI dataset and the Apollo-SouthBay dataset. Results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable registration accuracy and runtime efficiency to the state-of-the-art geometry-based methods, but with higher robustness to inaccurate initial poses. Detailed ablation and visualization analysis are included to further illustrate the behavior and insights of our network. The low registration error and high robustness of our method make it attractive to the substantial applications relying on the point cloud registration task."}

It is an important problem in practice that is, for example, encountered in autonomous driving. In order to gain robustness to such changes, long-term localization approaches often use segmantic segmentations as an invariant scene representation, as the semantic meaning of each scene part should not be affected by seasonal and other changes. However, these representations are typically not very discriminative due to the very limited number of available classes. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network, the Fine-Grained Segmentation Network (FGSN), that can be used to provide image segmentations with a larger number of labels and can be trained in a self-supervised fashion. In addition, we show how FGSNs can be trained to output consistent labels across seasonal changes. We show through extensive experiments that integrating the fine-grained segmentations produced by our FGSNs into existing localization algorithms leads to substantial improvements in localization performance."}

The 6D camera pose of the query image can be estimated with the predicted scene coordinate map. Additionally, the dense prediction can be used for other online robotic and AR applications such as obstacle avoidance.

This is achieved by extending recent ideas from learning of unsupervised image denoisers to unstructured 3D point clouds. Unsupervised image denoisers operate under the assumption that a noisy pixel observation is a random realization of a distribution around a clean pixel value, which allows appropriate learning on this distribution to eventually converge to the correct value. Regrettably, this assumption is not valid for unstructured points: 3D point clouds are subject to total noise, i.e. deviations in all coordinates, with no reliable pixel grid. Thus, an observation can be the realization of an entire manifold of clean 3D points, which makes the quality of a naive extension of unsupervised image denoisers to 3D point clouds unfortunately only little better than mean filtering. To overcome this, and to enable effective and unsupervised 3D point cloud denoising, we introduce a spatial prior term, that steers converges to the unique closest out of the many possible modes on the manifold. Our results demonstrate unsupervised denoising performance similar to that of supervised learning with clean data when given enough training examples - whereby we do not need any pairs of noisy and clean training data."}

The classical method of training CNNs is by labeling images in a supervised manner as in \"input image belongs to this label\" (Positive Learning; PL), which is a fast and accurate method if the labels are assigned correctly to all images. However, if inaccurate labels, or noisy labels, exist, training with PL will provide wrong information, thus severely degrading performance. To address this issue, we start with an indirect learning method called Negative Learning (NL), in which the CNNs are trained using a complementary label as in \"input image does not belong to this complementary label.\" Because the chances of selecting a true label as a complementary label are low, NL decreases the risk of providing incorrect information. Furthermore, to improve convergence, we extend our method by adopting PL selectively, termed as Selective Negative Learning and Positive Learning (SelNLPL). PL is used selectively to train upon expected-to-be-clean data, whose choices become possible as NL progresses, thus resulting in superior performance of filtering out noisy data. With simple semi-supervised training technique, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for noisy data classification, proving the superiority of SelNLPL's noisy data filtering ability."}

Our insight is that the 3D geometry of the document not only determines the warping of its texture but also causes the illumination effects. Therefore, our novelty resides on the explicit modeling of 3D shape for document paper in an end-to-end pipeline. Also, we contribute the largest and most comprehensive dataset for document image unwarping to date - Doc3D. This dataset features multiple ground-truth annotations, including 3D shape, surface normals, UV map, albedo image, etc. Training with Doc3D, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for DewarpNet with extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Existing rPPG approaches rely on analyzing very fine details of facial videos, which are prone to be affected by video compression. Here we propose a two-stage, end-to-end method using hidden rPPG information enhancement and attention networks, which is the first attempt to counter video compression loss and recover rPPG signals from highly compressed videos. The method includes two parts: 1) a Spatio-Temporal Video Enhancement Network (STVEN) for video enhancement, and 2) an rPPG network (rPPGNet) for rPPG signal recovery. The rPPGNet can work on its own for robust rPPG measurement, and the STVEN network can be added and jointly trained to further boost the performance especially on highly compressed videos. Comprehensive experiments are performed on two benchmark datasets to show that, 1) the proposed method not only achieves superior performance on compressed videos with high-quality videos pair, 2) it also generalizes well on novel data with only compressed videos available, which implies the promising potential for real-world applications."}

Projections arise in various contexts, such as long-exposure photography, where a dynamic scene is collapsed in time to produce a motion-blurred image, and corner cameras, where reflected light from a scene is collapsed along a spatial dimension because of an edge occluder to yield a 1D video. Deprojection is ill-posed-- often there are many plausible solutions for a given input. We first propose a probabilistic model capturing the ambiguity of the task. We then present a variational inference strategy using convolutional neural networks as functional approximators. Sampling from the inference network at test time yields plausible candidates from the distribution of original signals that are consistent with a given input projection. We evaluate the method on several datasets for both spatial and temporal deprojection tasks. We first demonstrate the method can recover human gait videos and face images from spatial projections, and then show that it can recover videos of moving digits from dramatically motion-blurred images obtained via temporal projection."}

In the first stage, edge-preserved smooth images are employed to train a structure reconstructor which completes the missing structures of the inputs. In the second stage, based on the reconstructed structures, a texture generator using appearance flow is designed to yield image details. Experiments on multiple publicly available datasets show the superior performance of the proposed network."}

The development and proliferation of GANs raises an interesting question: can we train a GAN to remove an object, if present, from an image while otherwise preserving the image? Specifically, can a GAN \"virtually heal\" anyone by turning his medical image, with an unknown health status (diseased or healthy), into a healthy one, so that diseased regions could be revealed by subtracting those two images? Such a task requires a GAN to identify a minimal subset of target pixels for domain translation, an ability that we call fixed-point translation, which no GAN is equipped with yet. Therefore, we propose a new GAN, called Fixed-Point GAN, trained by (1) supervising same-domain translation through a conditional identity loss, and (2) regularizing cross-domain translation through revised adversarial, domain classification, and cycle consistency loss. Based on fixed-point translation, we further derive a novel framework for disease detection and localization using only image-level annotation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art in multi-domain image-to-image translation and that it surpasses predominant weakly-supervised localization methods in both disease detection and localization.

Vehicle ReID is challenging due to 1) high intra-class variability (caused by the dependency of shape and appearance on viewpoint), and 2) small inter-class variability (caused by the similarity in shape and appearance between vehicles produced by different manufacturers). To address these challenges, we propose a Pose-Aware Multi-Task Re-Identification (PAMTRI) framework. This approach includes two innovations compared with previous methods. First, it overcomes viewpoint-dependency by explicitly reasoning about vehicle pose and shape via keypoints, heatmaps and segments from pose estimation. Second, it jointly classifies semantic vehicle attributes (colors and types) while performing ReID, through multi-task learning with the embedded pose representations. Since manually labeling images with detailed pose and attribute information is prohibitive, we create a large-scale highly randomized synthetic dataset with automatically annotated vehicle attributes for training. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of each proposed component, showing that PAMTRI achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art on two mainstream vehicle ReID benchmarks: VeRi and CityFlow-ReID."}

A promising approach to address these problems is quantization. However, uniformly quantizing a model to ultra-low precision leads to significant accuracy degradation. A novel solution for this is to use mixed-precision quantization, as some parts of the network may allow lower precision as compared to other layers. However, there is no systematic way to determine the precision of different layers. A brute force approach is not feasible for deep networks, as the search space for mixed-precision is exponential in the number of layers. Another challenge is a similar factorial complexity for determining block-wise fine-tuning order when quantizing the model to a target precision. Here, we introduce Hessian AWare Quantization (HAWQ), a novel second-order quantization method to address these problems. HAWQ allows for the automatic selection of the relative quantization precision of each layer, based on the layer's Hessian spectrum. Moreover, HAWQ provides a deterministic fine-tuning order for quantizing layers. We show the results of our method on Cifar-10 using ResNet20, and on ImageNet using Inception-V3, ResNet50 and SqueezeNext models. Comparing HAWQ with state-of-the-art shows that we can achieve similar/better accuracy with 8x activation compression ratio on ResNet20, as compared to DNAS, and up to 1% higher accuracy with up to 14% smaller models on ResNet50 and Inception-V3, compared to recently proposed methods of RVQuant and HAQ. Furthermore, we show that we can quantize SqueezeNext to just 1MB model size while achieving above 68% top1 accuracy on ImageNet."}

The photos people upload to social media are a historical and public data source of how people dress across the world and at different times. While we now have tools to automatically recognize the clothing and style attributes of what people are wearing in these photographs, we lack the ability to analyze spatial and temporal trends in these attributes or make predictions about the future. In this paper we address this need by providing an automatic framework that analyzes large corpora of street imagery to (a) discover and forecast long-term trends of various fashion attributes as well as automatically discovered styles, and (b) identify spatio-temporally localized events that affect what people wear. We show that our framework makes long term trend forecasts that are > 20% more accurate than prior art, and identifies hundreds of socially meaningful events that impact fashion across the globe."}

To our knowledge, it is the largest UAV-based vehicle ReID dataset. To increase intra-class variation, each vehicle is captured by at least two UAVs at different locations, with diverse view-angles and flight-altitudes. We manually label a variety of vehicle attributes, including vehicle type, color, skylight, bumper, spare tire and luggage rack. Furthermore, for each vehicle image, the annotator is also required to mark the discriminative parts that helps them to distinguish this particular vehicle from others. Besides the dataset, we also design a specific vehicle ReID algorithm to make full use of the rich annotation information. It is capable of explicitly detecting discriminative parts for each specific vehicle and significantly outperforming the evaluated baselines and state-of-the-art vehicle ReID approaches."}

A false positive (FP) from a false localization during autonomous driving can lead to fatal accidents and hinder safe and efficient driving. Therefore, a detection algorithm that can cope with mislocalizations is required in autonomous driving applications. This paper proposes a method for improving the detection accuracy while supporting a real-time operation by modeling the bounding box (bbox) of YOLOv3, which is the most representative of one-stage detectors, with a Gaussian parameter and redesigning the loss function. In addition, this paper proposes a method for predicting the localization uncertainty that indicates the reliability of bbox. By using the predicted localization uncertainty during the detection process, the proposed schemes can significantly reduce the FP and increase the true positive (TP), thereby improving the accuracy. Compared to a conventional YOLOv3, the proposed algorithm, Gaussian YOLOv3, improves the mean average precision (mAP) by 3.09 and 3.5 on the KITTI and Berkeley deep drive (BDD) datasets, respectively. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm is capable of real-time detection at faster than 42 frames per second (fps) and shows a higher accuracy than previous approaches with a similar fps. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is the most suitable for autonomous driving applications."}

Instead, of employing \"blind\" domain randomization, i.e., augmenting synthetic renderings with random backgrounds or changing illumination and colorization, we leverage the task network as its own adversarial guide toward useful augmentations that maximize the uncertainty of the output. To this end, we design a min-max optimization scheme where a given task competes against a special deception network to minimize the task error subject to the specific constraints enforced by the deceiver. The deception network samples from a family of differentiable pixel-level perturbations and exploits the task architecture to find the most destructive augmentations. Unlike GAN-based approaches that require unlabeled data from the target domain, our method achieves robust mappings that scale well to multiple target distributions from source data alone. We apply our framework to the tasks of digit recognition on enhanced MNIST variants, classification and object pose estimation on the Cropped LineMOD dataset as well as semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset and compare it to a number of domain adaptation approaches, thereby demonstrating similar results with superior generalization capabilities."}

In this paper, we analyze the object detection from video and point out that mAP alone is not sufficient to capture the temporal nature of video object detection. To tackle this problem, we propose a comprehensive metric, Average Delay (AD), to measure and compare detection delay. To facilitate delay evaluation, we carefully select a subset of ImageNet VID, which we name as ImageNet VIDT with an emphasis on complex trajectories. By extensively evaluating a wide range of detectors on VIDT, we show that most methods drastically increase the detection delay but still preserve mAP well. In other words, mAP is not sensitive enough to reflect the temporal characteristics of a video object detector. Our results suggest that video object detection methods should be evaluated with a delay metric, particularly for latency-critical applications such as autonomous vehicle perception."}

First, we simplify the current fine tuning based approaches which use a combination of classification and distillation losses to compensate for the limited availability of past data. We find that the distillation term actually hurts performance when a memory is allowed. Then, we modify the usual class IL memory component. Similar to existing works, a first memory stores exemplar images of past classes. A second memory is introduced here to store past class statistics obtained when they were initially learned. The intuition here is that classes are best modeled when all their data are available and that their initial statistics are useful across different incremental states. A prediction bias towards newly learned classes appears during inference because the dataset is imbalanced in their favor. The challenge is to make predictions of new and past classes more comparable. To do this, scores of past classes are rectified by leveraging contents from both memories. The method has negligible added cost, both in terms of memory and of inference complexity. Experiments with three large public datasets show that the proposed approach is more effective than a range of competitive state-of-the-art methods."}

By taking a further recurrent operation, each pixel can finally capture the full-image dependencies from all pixels. Overall, CCNet is with the following merits: 1) GPU memory friendly.

Generally, proposal-free methods generate instance-agnostic semantic segmentation labels and instance-aware features to group pixels into different object instances. However, previous methods mostly employ separate modules for these two sub-tasks and require multiple passes for inference. We argue that treating these two sub-tasks separately is suboptimal. In fact, employing multiple separate modules significantly reduces the potential for application. The mutual benefits between the two complementary sub-tasks are also unexplored. To this end, this work proposes a single-shot proposal-free instance segmentation method that requires only one single pass for prediction. Our method is based on a pixel-pair affinity pyramid, which computes the probability that two pixels belong to the same instance in a hierarchical manner. The affinity pyramid can also be jointly learned with the semantic class labeling and achieve mutual benefits. Moreover, incorporating with the learned affinity pyramid, a novel cascaded graph partition module is presented to sequentially generate instances from coarse to fine. Unlike previous time-consuming graph partition methods, this module achieves 5x speedup and 9% relative improvement on Average-Precision (AP). Our approach achieves new state of the art on the challenging Cityscapes dataset."}

Motivated by the observation that the object part, full object, and a collection of objects essentially differ in size, we propose a new concept called scale-diversity, which characterizes the spectrum of segmentations w.r.t. different scales. To address this, we present MultiSeg, a scale-diverse interactive image segmentation network that incorporates a set of two-dimensional scale priors into the model to generate a set of scale-varying proposals that conform to the user input. We explicitly encourage segmentation diversity during training by synthesizing diverse training samples for a given image. As a result, our method allows the user to quickly locate the closest segmentation target for further refinement if necessary. Despite its simplicity, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is capable of quickly producing diverse yet plausible segmentation outputs, reducing the user interaction required, especially in cases where many types of segmentations (object parts or groups) are expected."}

This unsupervised method simultaneously aligns global distribution to decrease race gap at domain-level, and learns the discriminative target representations at cluster level.

In particular, we consider general subjects such as non-human species where attaining a large scale annotated dataset is challenging. While multiview geometry can be used to self-supervise the unlabeled data, integrating the geometry into learning a keypoint detector is challenging due to representation mismatch. We address this mismatch by formulating a new differentiable representation of the epipolar constraint called epipolar divergence---a generalized distance from the epipolar lines to the corresponding keypoint distribution. Epipolar divergence characterizes when two view keypoint distributions produce zero reprojection error. We design a twin network that minimizes the epipolar divergence through stereo rectification that can significantly alleviate computational complexity and sampling aliasing in training. We demonstrate that our framework can localize customized keypoints of diverse species, e.g., humans, dogs, and monkeys."}

Our dataset features synchronized body and finger motion as well as audio data. To the best of our knowledge, it represents the largest motion capture and audio dataset of natural conversations to date. The statistical analysis verifies strong intraperson and interperson covariance of arm, hand, and speech features, potentially enabling new directions on data-driven social behavior analysis, prediction, and synthesis. As an illustration, we propose a novel real-time finger motion synthesis method: a temporal neural network innovatively trained with an inverse kinematics (IK) loss, which adds skeletal structural information to the generative model. Our qualitative user study shows that the finger motion generated by our method is perceived as natural and conversation enhancing, while the quantitative ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of IK loss."}

Within A2J, anchor points able to capture global-local spatial context information are densely set on depth image as local regressors for the joints. They contribute to predict the positions of the joints in ensemble way to enhance generalization ability. The proposed 3D articulated pose estimation paradigm is different from the state-of-the-art encoder-decoder based FCN, 3D CNN and point-set based manners. To discover informative anchor points towards certain joint, anchor proposal procedure is also proposed for A2J. Meanwhile 2D CNN (i.e., ResNet- 50) is used as backbone network to drive A2J, without using time-consuming 3D convolutional or deconvolutional layers. The experiments on 3 hand datasets and 2 body datasets verify A2J's superiority. Meanwhile, A2J is of high running speed around 100 FPS on single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU."}

Recent approaches have made significant progress towards regressing the parameters of parametric human body models directly from images. Because of the absence of images with 3D shape ground truth, relevant approaches rely on 2D annotations or sophisticated architecture designs. In this work, we advocate that there are more cues we can leverage, which are available for free in natural images, i.e., without getting more annotations, or modifying the network architecture. We propose a natural form of supervision, that capitalizes on the appearance constancy of a person among different frames (or viewpoints). This seemingly insignificant and often overlooked cue goes a long way for model-based pose estimation. The parametric model we employ allows us to compute a texture map for each frame. Assuming that the texture of the person does not change dramatically between frames, we can apply a novel texture consistency loss, which enforces that each point in the texture map has the same texture value across all frames. Since the texture is transferred in this common texture map space, no camera motion computation is necessary, or even an assumption of smoothness among frames. This makes our proposed supervision applicable in a variety of settings, ranging from monocular video, to multi-view images. We benchmark our approach against strong baselines that require the same or even more annotations that we do and we consistently outperform them. Simultaneously, we achieve state-of-the-art results among model-based pose estimation approaches in different benchmarks.

In this paper, we analyze cross-dataset generalization when training on existing datasets. We find that approaches perform well on the datasets they are trained on, but do not generalize to other datasets or in-the-wild scenarios. As a consequence, we introduce the first large-scale, multi-view hand dataset that is accompanied by both 3D hand pose and shape annotations. For annotating this real-world dataset, we propose an iterative, semi-automated `human-in-the-loop' approach, which includes hand fitting optimization to infer both the 3D pose and shape for each sample. We show that methods trained on our dataset consistently perform well when tested on other datasets. Moreover, the dataset allows us to train a network that predicts the full articulated hand shape from a single RGB image. The evaluation set can serve as a benchmark for articulated hand shape estimation."}

Most of the large activity recognition datasets consist of data sourced from the web, which does not reflect challenges that exist in activities of daily living. In this paper, we introduce a large real-world video dataset for activities of daily living: Toyota Smarthome. The dataset consists of 16K RGB+D clips of 31 activity classes, performed by seniors in a smarthome. Unlike previous datasets, videos were fully unscripted. As a result, the dataset poses several challenges: high intra-class variation, high class imbalance, simple and composite activities, and activities with similar motion and variable duration. Activities were annotated with both coarse and fine-grained labels. These characteristics differentiate Toyota Smarthome from other datasets for activity recognition. As recent activity recognition approaches fail to address the challenges posed by Toyota Smarthome, we present a novel activity recognition method with attention mechanism. We propose a pose driven spatio-temporal attention mechanism through 3D ConvNets. We show that our novel method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, as well as on the Toyota Smarthome dataset. We release the dataset for research use."}

However, labeled video data required to train such models has not been able to keep up with the ever increasing depth and sophistication of these networks. In this work we propose an alternative approach to learning video representations that requires no semantically labeled videos, and instead leverages the years of effort in collecting and labeling large and clean still-image datasets. We do so by using state-of-the-art models pre-trained on image datasets as \"teachers\" to train video models in a distillation framework. We demonstrate that our method learns truly spatiotemporal features, despite being trained only using supervision from still-image networks. Moreover, it learns good representations across different input modalities, using completely uncurated raw video data sources and with different 2D teacher models. Our method obtains strong transfer performance, outperforming standard techniques for bootstrapping video architectures with image based models by 16%. We believe that our approach opens up new approaches for learning spatiotemporal representations from unlabeled video data."}

Automating the process of action recognition from visual data has been the topic of much research in the computer vision community. But what if it is too dark, or if the person is occluded or behind a wall? In this paper, we introduce a neural network model that can detect human actions through walls and occlusions, and in poor lighting conditions. Our model takes radio frequency (RF) signals as input, generates 3D human skeletons as an intermediate representation, and recognizes actions and interactions of multiple people over time. By translating the input to an intermediate skeleton-based representation, our model can learn from both vision-based and RF-based datasets, and allow the two tasks to help each other. We show that our model achieves comparable accuracy to vision-based action recognition systems in visible scenarios, yet continues to work accurately when people are not visible, hence addressing scenarios that are beyond the limit of today's vision-based action recognition."}

Recent works exploit synthetic data to train the model for semantic segmentation, but the domain adaptation between real and synthetic images remains a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a Separated Semantic Feature based domain adaptation network, named SSF-DAN, for semantic segmentation. First, a Semantic-wise Separable Discriminator (SS-D) is designed to independently adapt semantic features across the target and source domains, which addresses the inconsistent adaptation issue in the class-wise adversarial learning. In SS-D, a progressive confidence strategy is included to achieve a more reliable separation. Then, an efficient Class-wise Adversarial loss Reweighting module (CA-R) is introduced to balance the class-wise adversarial learning process, which leads the generator to focus more on poorly adapted classes. The presented framework demonstrates robust performance, superior to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets."}

The variable density, random orientation, small size, and instance-to-instance heterogeneity of objects in overhead imagery calls for approaches distinct from existing models designed for natural scene datasets. Though new overhead imagery datasets are being developed, they almost universally comprise a single view taken from directly overhead (\"at nadir\"), failing to address a critical variable: look angle. By contrast, views vary in real-world overhead imagery, particularly in dynamic scenarios such as natural disasters where first looks are often over 40 degrees off-nadir. This represents an important challenge to computer vision methods, as changing view angle adds distortions, alters resolution, and changes lighting. At present, the impact of these perturbations for algorithmic detection and segmentation of objects is untested. To address this problem, we present an open source Multi-View Overhead Imagery dataset, termed SpaceNet MVOI, with 27 unique looks from a broad range of viewing angles (-32.5 degrees to 54.0 degrees). Each of these images cover the same 665 square km geographic extent and are annotated with 126,747 building footprint labels, enabling direct assessment of the impact of viewpoint perturbation on model performance. We benchmark multiple leading segmentation and object detection models on: (1) building detection, (2) generalization to unseen viewing angles and resolutions, and (3) sensitivity of building footprint extraction to changes in resolution. We find that state of the art segmentation and object detection models struggle to identify buildings in off-nadir imagery and generalize poorly to unseen views, presenting an important benchmark to explore the broadly relevant challenge of detecting small, heterogeneous target objects in visually dynamic contexts."}

While many previous works learn to hallucinate the shape directly from priors, we resort to further improving the shape quality by leveraging cross-view information with a graph convolutional network. Instead of building a direct mapping function from images to 3D shape, our model learns to predict series of deformations to improve a coarse shape iteratively. Inspired by traditional multiple view geometry methods, our network samples nearby area around the initial mesh's vertex locations and reasons an optimal deformation using perceptual feature statistics built from multiple input images. Extensive experiments show that our model produces accurate 3D shape that are not only visually plausible from the input perspectives, but also well aligned to arbitrary viewpoints. With the help of physically driven architecture, our model also exhibits generalization capability across different semantic categories, number of input images, and quality of mesh initialization."}

We refer to this reconstruction as QUARCH (QUasi-Affine Reconstruction with respect to Camera centers and the Hodographs of horopters). A QUARCH can be obtained by solving a semidefinite programming problem when, (i) the images have been captured by a moving camera with constant intrinsic parameters, and (ii) a vague knowledge of the relative orientation (under or over 120 degrees) between camera pairs is available. The resulting reconstruction comes close enough to an affine one allowing thus an easy upgrade of the QUARCH to its affine and metric counterparts. We also present a constrained Levenberg-Marquardt method for nonlinear optimization subject to Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) constraints so as to ensure that the QUARCH LMIs are satisfied during optimization. Experiments with synthetic and real data show the benefits of QUARCH in reliably obtaining a metric reconstruction."}

Besides the challenges in image-based virtual try-on (e.g., clothes fidelity, image synthesis), video virtual try-on further requires spatiotemporal consistency. Directly adopting existing image-based approaches often fails to generate coherent video with natural and realistic textures. In this work, we propose Flow-navigated Warping Generative Adversarial Network (FW-GAN), a novel framework that learns to synthesize the video of virtual try-on based on a person image, the desired clothes image, and a series of target poses. FW-GAN aims to synthesize the coherent and natural video while manipulating the pose and clothes. It consists of: (i) a flow-guided fusion module that warps the past frames to assist synthesis, which is also adopted in the discriminator to help enhance the coherence and quality of the synthesized video; (ii) a warping net that is designed to warp clothes image for the refinement of clothes textures; (iii) a parsing constraint loss that alleviates the problem caused by the misalignment of segmentation maps from images with different poses and various clothes. Experiments on our newly collected dataset show that FW-GAN can synthesize high-quality video of virtual try-on and significantly outperforms other methods both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

Despite the great success of the generic object detection methods trained on ground-to-ground images, a huge performance drop is observed when they are directly applied to images captured by UAVs. The unsatisfactory performance is owing to many UAV-specific nuisances, such as varying flying altitudes, adverse weather conditions, dynamically changing viewing angles, etc. Those nuisances constitute a large number of fine-grained domains, across which the detection model has to stay robust. Fortunately, UAVs will record meta-data that depict those varying attributes, which are either freely available along with the UAV images, or can be easily obtained. We propose to utilize those free meta-data in conjunction with associated UAV images to learn domain-robust features via an adversarial training framework dubbed Nuisance Disentangled Feature Transform (NDFT), for the specific challenging problem of object detection in UAV images, achieving a substantial gain in robustness to those nuisances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, by showing state-of-the- art performance (single model) on two existing UAV-based object detection benchmarks.

The most widely investigated security concern of DNN is from its malicious input, a.k.a adversarial example. Nevertheless, the security challenge of DNN's parameters is not well explored yet. In this work, we are the first to propose a novel DNN weight attack methodology called Bit-Flip Attack (BFA) which can crush a neural network through maliciously flipping extremely small amount of bits within its weight storage memory system (i.e., DRAM). The bit-flip operations could be conducted through well-known Row-Hammer attack, while our main contribution is to develop an algorithm to identify the most vulnerable bits of DNN weight parameters (stored in memory as binary bits), that could maximize the accuracy degradation with a minimum number of bit-flips. Our proposed BFA utilizes a Progressive Bit Search (PBS) method which combines gradient ranking and progressive search to identify the most vulnerable bit to be flipped. With the aid of PBS, we can successfully attack a ResNet-18 fully malfunction (i.e., top-1 accuracy degrade from 69.8% to 0.1%) only through 13 bit-flips out of 93 million bits, while randomly flipping 100 bits merely degrades the accuracy by less than 1%.

However, these approaches often report lower accuracy in evaluating the searched architecture or transferring it to another dataset. This is arguably due to the large gap between the architecture depths in search and evaluation scenarios. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm which allows the depth of searched architectures to grow gradually during the training procedure. This brings two issues, namely, heavier computational overheads and weaker search stability, which we solve using search space approximation and regularization, respectively. With a significantly reduced search time ( 7 hours on a single GPU), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the proxy dataset (CIFAR10 or CIFAR100) and the target dataset (ImageNet).

PPA hardware consists of a fine-grained array of general-purpose processing elements, each capable of light capture, data storage, program execution, and communication with neighboring elements. This allows images to be stored and manipulated directly at the point of light capture, rather than having to transfer images to external processing hardware. Our CNN approach divides this array up into 4x4 blocks of processing elements, essentially trading-off image resolution for increased local memory capacity per 4x4 \"pixel\". We implement parallel operations for image addition, subtraction and bit-shifting images in this 4x4 block format. Using these components we formulate how to perform ternary weight convolutions upon these images, compactly store results of such convolutions, perform max-pooling, and transfer the resulting sub-sampled data to an attached micro-controller. We train ternary weight filter CNNs for digit recognition and a simple tracking task, and demonstrate inference of these networks upon the SCAMP5 PPA system.

The number of possible sharing patterns are combinatorial in the depth of the network and the number of tasks, and thus hand-crafting an architecture, purely based on the human intuitions of task relationships can be time-consuming and suboptimal. In this paper, we present a probabilistic approach to learning task-specific and shared representations in CNNs for multi-task learning. Specifically, we propose \"stochastic filter groups\" (SFG), a mechanism to assign convolution kernels in each layer to \"specialist\" and \"generalist\" groups, which are specific to and shared across different tasks, respectively. The SFG modules determine the connectivity between layers and the structures of task-specific and shared representations in the network. We employ variational inference to learn the posterior distribution over the possible grouping of kernels and network parameters.

Previous works may not effectively uncover the underlying reasons that would lead to the drastic model degradation on the target task. In this paper, we empirically reveal that the erratic discrimination of the target domain mainly stems from its much smaller feature norms with respect to that of the source domain. To this end, we propose a novel parameter-free Adaptive Feature Norm approach. We demonstrate that progressively adapting the feature norms of the two domains to a large range of values can result in significant transfer gains, implying that those task-specific features with larger norms are more transferable. Our method successfully unifies the computation of both standard and partial domain adaptation with more robustness against the negative transfer issue. Without bells and whistles but a few lines of code, our method substantially lifts the performance on the target task and exceeds state-of-the-arts by a large margin (11.5% on Office-Home and 17.1% on VisDA2017).

Most existing approaches independently address task-transferability and cross-domain adaptation, resulting in limited generalization. In this paper, we propose UM-Adapt - a unified framework to effectively perform unsupervised domain adaptation for spatially-structured prediction tasks, simultaneously maintaining a balanced performance across individual tasks in a multi-task setting. To realize this, we propose two novel regularization strategies; a) Contour-based content regularization (CCR) and b) exploitation of inter-task coherency using a cross-task distillation module. Furthermore, avoiding a conventional ad-hoc domain discriminator, we re-utilize the cross-task distillation loss as output of an energy function to adversarially minimize the input domain discrepancy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate superior generalizability of the learned representations simultaneously for multiple tasks under domain-shifts from synthetic to natural environments. UM-Adapt yields state-of-the-art transfer learning results on ImageNet classification and comparable performance on PASCAL VOC 2007 detection task, even with a smaller backbone-net.

Existing scanning lidar systems achieve low spatial resolution at large ranges due to mechanically-limited angular sampling rates, restricting scene understanding tasks to close-range clusters with dense sampling. Moreover, today's pulsed lidar scanners suffer from high cost, power consumption, large form-factors, and they fail in the presence of strong backscatter. We depart from point scanning and demonstrate that it is possible to turn a low-cost CMOS gated imager into a dense depth camera with at least 80m range - by learning depth from three gated images. The proposed architecture exploits semantic context across gated slices, and is trained on a synthetic discriminator loss without the need of dense depth labels. The proposed replacement for scanning lidar systems is real-time, handles back-scatter and provides dense depth at long ranges.

Several recent 3D object classification methods have reported state-of-the-art performance on CAD model datasets such as ModelNet40 with high accuracy ( 92%). Despite such impressive results, in this paper, we argue that object classification is still a challenging task when objects are framed with real-world settings. To prove this, we introduce ScanObjectNN, a new real-world point cloud object dataset based on scanned indoor scene data. From our comprehensive benchmark, we show that our dataset poses great challenges to existing point cloud classification techniques as objects from real-world scans are often cluttered with background and/or are partial due to occlusions. We identify three key open problems for point cloud object classification, and propose new point cloud classification neural networks that achieve state-of-the-art performance on classifying objects with cluttered background.

While being able to achieve good accuracies in various scene understanding tasks, previous methods often have low training speed and complex network architecture. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing an efficient end-to-end permutation invariant convolution for point cloud deep learning. Our simple yet effective convolution operator named ShellConv uses statistics from concentric spherical shells to define representative features and resolve the point order ambiguity, allowing traditional convolution to perform on such features. Based on ShellConv we further build an efficient neural network named ShellNet to directly consume the point clouds with larger receptive fields while maintaining less layers. We demonstrate the efficacy of ShellNet by producing state-of-the-art results on object classification, object part segmentation, and semantic scene segmentation while keeping the network very fast to train."}

Training on the normal data, the autoencoder is expected to produce higher reconstruction error for the abnormal inputs than the normal ones, which is adopted as a criterion for identifying anomalies. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. It has been observed that sometimes the autoencoder \"generalizes\" so well that it can also reconstruct anomalies well, leading to the miss detection of anomalies. To mitigate this drawback for autoencoder based anomaly detector, we propose to augment the autoencoder with a memory module and develop an improved autoencoder called memory-augmented autoencoder, i.e. MemAE. Given an input, MemAE firstly obtains the encoding from the encoder and then uses it as a query to retrieve the most relevant memory items for reconstruction. At the training stage, the memory contents are updated and are encouraged to represent the prototypical elements of the normal data. At the test stage, the learned memory will be fixed, and the reconstruction is obtained from a few selected memory records of the normal data. The reconstruction will thus tend to be close to a normal sample. Thus the reconstructed errors on anomalies will be strengthened for anomaly detection. MemAE is free of assumptions on the data type and thus general to be applied to different tasks. Experiments on various datasets prove the excellent generalization and high effectiveness of the proposed MemAE."}

Our proposed network architecture SC-FEGAN is well suited for generating high-quality synthetic images using intuitive user inputs."}

Recent AutoML approaches promise to relieve us from this effort. However, they are mainly designed for comparatively small-scale classification tasks. In this work, we show how to use and extend existing AutoML techniques to efficiently optimize large-scale U-Net-like encoder-decoder architectures. In particular, we leverage gradient-based neural architecture search and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter search. The resulting optimization does not require a large-scale compute cluster. We show results on disparity estimation that clearly outperform the manually optimized baseline and reach state-of-the-art performance."}

In this paper, we aim to fully leverage the potential of styles to improve the performance of CNNs in general vision tasks. We propose a Style-based Recalibration Module (SRM), a simple yet effective architectural unit, which adaptively recalibrates intermediate feature maps by exploiting their styles. SRM first extracts the style information from each channel of the feature maps by style pooling, then estimates per-channel recalibration weight via channel-independent style integration. By incorporating the relative importance of individual styles into feature maps, SRM effectively enhances the representational ability of a CNN. The proposed module is directly fed into existing CNN architectures with negligible overhead. We conduct comprehensive experiments on general image recognition as well as tasks related to styles, which verify the benefit of SRM over recent approaches such as Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE). To explain the inherent difference between SRM and SE, we provide an in-depth comparison of their representational properties."}

In the latter case, the optimization is often non-differentiable and also not very amenable to derivative-free optimization methods. Most methods in use today require sizable computational resources. And if we want networks that additionally satisfy resource constraints, the above challenges are exacerbated because the search must now balance accuracy with certain budget constraints on resources. We formulate this problem as the optimization of a set function -- we find that the empirical behavior of this set function often (but not always) satisfies marginal gain and monotonicity principles -- properties central to the idea of submodularity. Based on this observation, we adapt algorithms within discrete optimization to obtain heuristic schemes for neural network architecture search, where we have resource constraints on the architecture. This simple scheme when applied on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, identifies resource-constrained architectures with quantifiably better performance than current state-of-the-art models designed for mobile devices. Specifically, we find high-performing architectures with fewer parameters and computations by a search method that is much faster."}

We propose Asymmetric Convolution Block (ACB), an architecture-neutral structure as a CNN building block, which uses 1D asymmetric convolutions to strengthen the square convolution kernels. For an off-the-shelf architecture, we replace the standard square-kernel convolutional layers with ACBs to construct an Asymmetric Convolutional Network (ACNet), which can be trained to reach a higher level of accuracy. After training, we equivalently convert the ACNet into the same original architecture, thus requiring no extra computations anymore. We have observed that ACNet can improve the performance of various models on CIFAR and ImageNet by a clear margin. Through further experiments, we attribute the effectiveness of ACB to its capability of enhancing the model's robustness to rotational distortions and strengthening the central skeleton parts of square convolution kernels."}

Our method, named DPOD (Dense Pose Object Detector), estimates dense multi-class 2D-3D correspondence maps between an input image and available 3D models. Given the correspondences, a 6DoF pose is computed via PnP and RANSAC. An additional RGB pose refinement of the initial pose estimates is performed using a custom deep learning-based refinement scheme. Our results and comparison to a vast number of related works demonstrate that a large number of correspondences is beneficial for obtaining high-quality 6D poses both before and after refinement. Unlike other methods that mainly use real data for training and do not train on synthetic renderings, we perform evaluation on both synthetic and real training data demonstrating superior results before and after refinement when compared to all recent detectors. While being precise, the presented approach is still real-time capable."}

The first stage is a bottom-up proposal generation network that uses raw point clouds as input to generate accurate proposals by seeding each point with a new spherical anchor. It achieves a higher recall with less computation compared with prior works. Then, PointsPool is applied for proposal feature generation by transforming interior point features from sparse expression to compact representation, which saves even more computation. In box prediction, which is the second stage, we implement a parallel intersection-over-union (IoU) branch to increase awareness of localization accuracy, resulting in further improved performance. We conduct experiments on KITTI dataset, and evaluate our method on 3D object and Bird's Eye View (BEV) detection.

We propose a Denoiser and UPsampler Network (DUP-Net) structure as defenses for 3D adversarial point cloud classification, where the two modules reconstruct surface smoothness by dropping or adding points. In this paper, statistical outlier removal (SOR) and a data-driven upsampling network are considered as denoiser and upsampler respectively. Compared with baseline defenses, DUP-Net has three advantages. First, with DUP-Net as a defense, the target model is more robust to white-box adversarial attacks. Second, the statistical outlier removal provides added robustness since it is a non-differentiable denoising operation. Third, the upsampler network can be trained on a small dataset and defends well against adversarial attacks generated from other point cloud datasets. We conduct various experiments to validate that DUP-Net is very effective as defense in practice. Our best defense eliminates 83.8% of C&W and l2 loss based attack (point shifting), 50.0% of C&W and Hausdorff distance loss based attack (point adding) and 9.0% of saliency map based attack (point dropping) under 200 dropped points on PointNet."}

Recent state-of-the-art methods adopt a 3D CNN stream to learn spatiotemporal features and another flow stream to learn motion features. In this work, we aim to efficiently encode these two features in a unified 2D framework. To this end, we first propose a STM block, which contains a Channel-wise SpatioTemporal Module (CSTM) to present the spatiotemporal features and a Channel-wise Motion Module (CMM) to efficiently encode motion features. We then replace original residual blocks in the ResNet architecture with STM blcoks to form a simple yet effective STM network by introducing very limited extra computation cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed STM network outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both temporal-related datasets (i.e., Something-Something v1 & v2 and Jester) and scene-related datasets (i.e., Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and HMDB-51) with the help of encoding spatiotemporal and motion features together."}

In contrast, humans and other embodied agents have the ability to move in the environment and actively control the viewing angle to better understand object shapes and semantics. In this work, we introduce the task of Embodied Amodel Recognition (EAR): an agent is instantiated in a 3D environment close to an occluded target object, and is free to move in the environment to perform object classification, amodal object localization, and amodal object segmentation. To address this problem, we develop a new model called Embodied Mask R-CNN for agents to learn to move strategically to improve their visual recognition abilities. We conduct experiments using a simulator for indoor environments. Experimental results show that: 1) agents with embodiment (movement) achieve better visual recognition performance than passive ones and 2) in order to improve visual recognition abilities, agents can learn strategic paths that are different from shortest paths."}

A chair may be \"behind\" a person even if it appears to the left of the person in the image (depending on which way the person is facing). Two students that appear close to each other in the image may not in fact be \"next to\" each other if there is a third student between them. We introduce SpatialSense, a dataset specializing in spatial relation recognition which captures a broad spectrum of such challenges, allowing for proper benchmarking of computer vision techniques. SpatialSense is constructed through adversarial crowdsourcing, in which human annotators are tasked with finding spatial relations that are difficult to predict using simple cues such as 2D spatial configuration or language priors. Adversarial crowdsourcing significantly reduces dataset bias and samples more interesting relations in the long tail compared to existing datasets. On SpatialSense, state-of-the-art recognition models perform comparably to simple baselines, suggesting that they rely on straightforward cues instead of fully reasoning about this complex task. The SpatialSense benchmark provides a path forward to advancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of computer vision systems. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/SpatialSense."}

In contrast, modern instance segmentation approaches are dominated by methods that first detect object bounding boxes, and then crop and segment these regions, as popularized by Mask R-CNN. In this work, we investigate the paradigm of dense sliding-window instance segmentation, which is surprisingly under-explored. Our core observation is that this task is fundamentally different than other dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation or bounding-box object detection, as the output at every spatial location is itself a geometric structure with its own spatial dimensions. To formalize this, we treat dense instance segmentation as a prediction task over 4D tensors and present a general framework called TensorMask that explicitly captures this geometry and enables novel operators on 4D tensors. We demonstrate that the tensor view leads to large gains over baselines that ignore this structure, and leads to results comparable to Mask R-CNN. These promising results suggest that TensorMask can serve as a foundation for novel advances in dense mask prediction and a more complete understanding of the task. Code will be made available."}

The segmentation network is trained without any information about target domains and tested on the unseen target domains. To this end, we propose a new approach of domain randomization and pyramid consistency to learn a model with high generalizability. First, we propose to randomize the synthetic images with styles of real images in terms of visual appearances using auxiliary datasets, in order to effectively learn domain-invariant representations. Second, we further enforce pyramid consistency across different \"stylized\" images and within an image, in order to learn domain-invariant and scale-invariant features, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted on generalization from GTA and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, BDDS, and Mapillary; and our method achieves superior results over the state-of-the-art techniques. Remarkably, our generalization results are on par with or even better than those obtained by state-of-the-art simulation-to-real domain adaptation methods, which access the target domain data at training time."}

However, neural classifiers are often extremely brittle when confronted with domain shift---changes in the input distribution that occur over time. We present ACE, a framework for semantic segmentation that dynamically adapts to changing environments over time. By aligning the distribution of labeled training data from the original source domain with the distribution of incoming data in a shifted domain, ACE synthesizes labeled training data for environments as it sees them. This stylized data is then used to update a segmentation model so that it performs well in new environments. To avoid forgetting knowledge from past environments, we introduce a memory that stores feature statistics from previously seen domains. These statistics can be used to replay images in any of the previously observed domains, thus preventing catastrophic forgetting. In addition to standard batch training using stochastic gradient decent (SGD), we also experiment with fast adaptation methods based on adaptive meta-learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets from SYNTHIA, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach when adapting to a number of tasks."}

To speed up performance, it is common to downsample the input frame. However, this comes at the cost of missed small objects and reduced accuracy at semantic boundaries. To address this problem, we propose a new content-adaptive downsampling technique that learns to favor sampling locations near semantic boundaries of target classes. Cost-performance analysis shows that our method consistently outperforms the uniform sampling improving balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Our adaptive sampling gives segmentation with better quality of boundaries and more reliable support for smaller-size objects."}

In contrast to previous methods that predict 3D poses independently of the focal length or assume a constant focal length, we explicitly estimate and integrate the focal length into the 3D pose estimation. For this purpose, we combine deep learning techniques and geometric algorithms in a two-stage approach: First, we estimate an initial focal length and establish 2D-3D correspondences from a single RGB image using a deep network. Second, we recover 3D poses and refine the focal length by minimizing the reprojection error of the predicted correspondences. In this way, we exploit the geometric prior given by the focal length for 3D pose estimation. This results in two advantages: First, we achieve significantly improved 3D translation and 3D pose accuracy compared to existing methods. Second, our approach finds a geometric consensus between the individual projection parameters, which is required for precise 2D-3D alignment. We evaluate our proposed approach on three challenging real-world datasets (Pix3D, Comp, and Stanford) with different object categories and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art by up to 20% absolute in multiple different metrics."}

While the recent progress in convolutional neural networks has allowed impressive results for 3D human pose estimation, estimating the full 3D shape of a person is still an open issue. Model-based approaches can output precise meshes of naked under-cloth human bodies but fail to estimate details and un-modelled elements such as hair or clothing. On the other hand, non-parametric volumetric approaches can potentially estimate complete shapes but, in practice, they are limited by the resolution of the output grid and cannot produce detailed estimates. In this work, we propose a non-parametric approach that employs a double depth map to represent the 3D shape of a person: a visible depth map and a \"hidden\" depth map are estimated and combined, to reconstruct the human 3D shape as done with a \"mould\". This representation through 2D depth maps allows a higher resolution output with a much lower dimension than voxel-based volumetric representations. Additionally, our fully derivable depth-based model allows us to efficiently incorporate a discriminator in an adversarial fashion to improve the accuracy and \"humanness\" of the 3D output. We train and quantitatively validate our approach on SURREAL and on 3D-HUMANS, a new photorealistic dataset made of semi-synthetic in-house videos annotated with 3D ground truth surfaces."}

In this paper, we present an approach to model dressed humans and predict their geometry from single images. We contribute in three fundamental aspects of the problem, namely, a new dataset, a novel shape parameterization algorithm and an end-to-end deep generative network for predicting shape. First, we present 3DPeople, a large-scale synthetic dataset with 2 Million photo-realistic images of 80 subjects performing 70 activities and wearing diverse outfits. Besides providing textured 3D meshes for clothes and body we annotated the dataset with segmentation masks, skeletons, depth, normal maps and optical flow. All this together makes 3DPeople suitable for a plethora of tasks. We then represent the 3D shapes using 2D geometry images. To build these images we propose a novel spherical area-preserving parameterization algorithm based on the optimal mass transportation method. We show this approach to improve existing spherical maps which tend to shrink the elongated parts of the full body models such as the arms and legs, making the geometry images incomplete. Finally, we design a multi-resolution deep generative network that, given an input image of a dressed human, predicts his/her geometry image (and thus the clothed body shape) in an end-to-end manner. We obtain very promising results in jointly capturing body pose and clothing shape, both for synthetic validation and on the wild images."}

Our main idea is to turn shape regression into an aligned image-to-image translation problem. The input to our method is a partial texture map of the visible region obtained from off-the-shelf methods. From a partial texture, we estimate detailed normal and vector displacement maps, which can be applied to a low-resolution smooth body model to add detail and clothing.

Using PIFu, we propose an end-to-end deep learning method for digitizing highly detailed clothed humans that can infer both 3D surface and texture from a single image, and optionally, multiple input images. Highly intricate shapes, such as hairstyles, clothing, as well as their variations and deformations can be digitized in a unified way. Compared to existing representations used for 3D deep learning, PIFu produces high-resolution surfaces including largely unseen regions such as the back of a person. In particular, it is memory efficient unlike the voxel representation, can handle arbitrary topology, and the resulting surface is spatially aligned with the input image. Furthermore, while previous techniques are designed to process either a single image or multiple views, PIFu extends naturally to arbitrary number of views. We demonstrate high-resolution and robust reconstructions on real world images from the DeepFashion dataset, which contains a variety of challenging clothing types.

DF2Net decomposes the reconstruction process into three stages, each of which is processed by an elaborately-designed network, namely D-Net, F-Net, and Fr-Net. D-Net exploits a U-net architecture to map the input image to a dense depth image. F-Net refines the output of D-Net by integrating features from depth and RGB domains, whose output is further enhanced by Fr-Net with a novel multi-resolution hypercolumn architecture. In addition, we introduce three types of data to train these networks, including 3D model synthetic data, 2D image reconstructed data, and fine facial images. We elaborately exploit different datasets (or combination) together with well-designed losses to train different networks. Qualitative evaluation indicates that our DF2Net can effectively reconstruct subtle facial details such as small crow's feet and wrinkles.

This work attempts to address the uncertainty of lifting the detected 2D joints to the 3D space by introducing an intermediate state - Part-Centric Heatmap Triplets (HEMlets), which shortens the gap between the 2D observation and the 3D interpretation. The HEMlets utilize three joint-heatmaps to represent the relative depth information of the end-joints for each skeletal body part. In our approach, a Convolutional Network(ConvNet) is first trained to predict HEMlests from the input image, followed by a volumetric joint-heatmap regression. We leverage on the integral operation to extract the joint locations from the volumetric heatmaps, guaranteeing end-to-end learning. Despite the simplicity of the network design, the quantitative comparisons show a significant performance improvement over the best-of-grade method (by 20% on Human3.6M). The proposed method naturally supports training with \"in-the-wild\" images, where only weakly-annotated relative depth information of skeletal joints is available. This further improves the generalization ability of our model, as validated by qualitative comparisons on outdoor images."}

Based on this score, our tracker determines whether the tracked object being present or absent, and then chooses the tracking strategies of local search or global search respectively in the next frame. To speed up the image-wide global search, a novel skimming module is designed to efficiently choose the most possible regions from a large number of sliding windows.

It consists of two building blocks: first, the encoder network extracts low-resolution spatiotemporal features from an input clip of several consecutive frames, and then the following prediction network decodes the encoded features spatially while aggregating all the temporal information. As a result, a single prediction map is produced from an input clip of multiple frames. Frame-wise saliency maps can be predicted by applying TASED-Net in a sliding-window fashion to a video. The proposed approach assumes that the saliency map of any frame can be predicted by considering a limited number of past frames. The results of our extensive experiments on video saliency detection validate this assumption and demonstrate that our fully-convolutional model with temporal aggregation method is effective. TASED-Net significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on all three major large-scale datasets of video saliency detection: DHF1K, Hollywood2, and UCFSports.

We first reconstruct the 3D points while estimating the poses of the camera and the projector, which are alternately moved around the object, by combining multi-view structured light and structure-from-motion (SfM) techniques. We then exploit the projector for multispectral imaging and estimate the spectral reflectance of each 3D point based on a novel spectral reflectance estimation model considering the geometric relationship between the reconstructed 3D points and the estimated projector positions. Experimental results on several real objects demonstrate that our system can precisely acquire a dense 3D model with the full spectral reflectance property using off-the-shelf devices."}

However, directly employing adversarial learning and cycle-consistency constraints is insufficient to learn the underlying relationship between the shadow and shadow-free domains, since the mapping between shadow and shadow-free images is not simply one-to-one. To address the problem, we formulate Mask-ShadowGAN, a new deep framework that automatically learns to produce a shadow mask from the input shadow image and then takes the mask to guide the shadow generation via re-formulated cycle-consistency constraints. Particularly, the framework simultaneously learns to produce shadow masks and learns to remove shadows, to maximize the overall performance. Also, we prepared an unpaired dataset for shadow removal and demonstrated the effectiveness of Mask-ShadowGAN on various experiments, even it was trained on unpaired data."}

This paper focuses on understanding the intrinsic memorability of visual content. To address this challenge, we introduce a large scale dataset (VideoMem) composed of 10,000 videos with memorability scores. In contrast to previous work on image memorability -- where memorability was measured a few minutes after memorization -- memory performance is measured twice: a few minutes and again 24-72 hours after memorization. Hence, the dataset comes with short-term and long-term memorability annotations. After an in-depth analysis of the dataset, we investigate various deep neural network-based models for the prediction of video memorability. Our best model using a ranking loss achieves a Spearman's rank correlation of 0.494 (respectively 0.256) for short-term (resp. long-term) memorability prediction, while our model with attention mechanism provides insights of what makes a content memorable. The VideoMem dataset with pre-extracted features is publicly available."}

We propose an algorithm that analyzes these \"rescans\" to infer a temporal model of a scene with semantic instance information. Our algorithm operates inductively by using the temporal model resulting from past observations to infer an instance segmentation of a new scan, which is then used to update the temporal model. The model contains object instance associations across time and thus can be used to track individual objects, even though there are only sparse observations. During experiments with a new benchmark for the new task, our algorithm outperforms alternate approaches based on state-of-the-art networks for semantic instance segmentation."}

Given a triplet: an image, Q&A history, and current question, all the prevailing methods follow a codec (i.e., encoder-decoder) fashion in a supervised learning paradigm: a multimodal encoder encodes the triplet into a feature vector, which is then fed into the decoder for the current answer generation, supervised by the ground-truth. However, this conventional supervised learning does NOT take into account the impact of imperfect history, violating the conversational nature of visual dialog and thus making the codec more inclined to learn history bias but not contextual reasoning. To this end, inspired by the actor-critic policy gradient in reinforcement learning, we propose a novel training paradigm called History Advantage Sequence Training (HAST). Specifically, we intentionally impose wrong answers in the history, obtaining an adverse critic, and see how the historic error impacts the codec's future behavior by History Advantage -- a quantity obtained by subtracting the adverse critic from the gold reward of ground-truth history. Moreover, to make the codec more sensitive to the history, we propose a novel attention network called History-Aware Co-Attention Network (HACAN) which can be effectively trained by using HAST. Experimental results on three benchmarks: VisDial v0.9&v1.0 and GuessWhat?!, show that the proposed HAST strategy consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised counterparts."}

In this work, we propose a generic approach called Human Importance-aware Network Tuning (HINT) that effectively leverages human demonstrations to improve visual grounding. HINT encourages deep networks to be sensitive to the same input regions as humans. Our approach optimizes the alignment between human attention maps and gradient-based network importances -- ensuring that models learn not just to look at but rather rely on visual concepts that humans found relevant for a task when making predictions. We apply HINT to Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning tasks, outperforming top approaches on splits that penalize over-reliance on language priors (VQA-CP and robust captioning) using human attention demonstrations for just 6% of the training data."}

We propose a novel end-to-end model that uses caption-to-image retrieval as a downstream task to guide the process of phrase localization. Our method, as a first step, infers the latent correspondences between regions-of-interest (RoIs) and phrases in the caption and creates a discriminative image representation using these matched RoIs. In the subsequent step, this learned representation is aligned with the caption. Our key contribution lies in building this \"caption-conditioned\" image encoding, which tightly couples both the tasks and allows the weak supervision to effectively guide visual grounding. We provide extensive empirical and qualitative analysis to investigate the different components of our proposed model and compare it with competitive baselines. For phrase localization, we report an improvement of 4.9% and 1.3% (absolute) over the prior state-of-the-art on the VisualGenome and Flickr30k Entities datasets. We also report results that are at par with the state-of-the-art on the downstream caption-to-image retrieval task on COCO and Flickr30k datasets."}

However, such datasets are expensive and time consuming to create and therefore difficult to obtain on a large scale. In this work, we propose instead to learn such embeddings from video data with readily available natural language annotations in the form of automatically transcribed narrations. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we introduce HowTo100M: a large-scale dataset of 136 million video clips sourced from 1.22M narrated instructional web videos depicting humans performing and describing over 23k different visual tasks. Our data collection procedure is fast, scalable and does not require any additional manual annotation. Second, we demonstrate that a text-video embedding trained on this data leads to state-of-the-art results for text-to-video retrieval and action localization on instructional video datasets such as YouCook2 or CrossTask. Finally, we show that this embedding transfers well to other domains: fine-tuning on generic Youtube videos (MSR-VTT dataset) and movies (LSMDC dataset) outperforms models trained on these datasets alone. Our dataset, code and models are publicly available."}

The approach, dubbed Floor-SP, formulates a novel optimization problem, where room-wise coordinate descent sequentially solves shortest path problems to optimize the floorplan graph structure. The objective function consists of data terms guided by deep neural networks, consistency terms encouraging adjacent rooms to share corners and walls, and the model complexity term. The approach does not require corner/edge primitive extraction unlike most other methods. We have evaluated our system on production-quality RGBD scans of 527 apartments or houses, including many units with non-Manhattan structures. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate a significant performance boost over the current state-of-the-art.

Several mainstream works (e.g., 3D-R2N2) use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to fuse multiple feature maps extracted from input images sequentially. However, when given the same set of input images with different orders, RNN-based approaches are unable to produce consistent reconstruction results. Moreover, due to long-term memory loss, RNNs cannot fully exploit input images to refine reconstruction results. To solve these problems, we propose a novel framework for single-view and multi-view 3D reconstruction, named Pix2Vox. By using a well-designed encoder-decoder, it generates a coarse 3D volume from each input image. Then, a context-aware fusion module is introduced to adaptively select high-quality reconstructions for each part (e.g., table legs) from different coarse 3D volumes to obtain a fused 3D volume. Finally, a refiner further refines the fused 3D volume to generate the final output. Experimental results on the ShapeNet and Pix3D benchmarks indicate that the proposed Pix2Vox outperforms state-of-the-arts by a large margin. Furthermore, the proposed method is 24 times faster than 3D-R2N2 in terms of backward inference time. The experiments on ShapeNet unseen 3D categories have shown the superior generalization abilities of our method."}

Although such objective functions generate near-photorealistic results, their capability is limited, since they estimate the reconstruction error for an entire image in the same way, without considering any semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel method to benefit from perceptual loss in a more objective way. We optimize a deep network-based decoder with a targeted objective function that penalizes images at different semantic levels using the corresponding terms. In particular, the proposed method leverages our proposed OBB (Object, Background and Boundary) labels, generated from segmentation labels, to estimate a suitable perceptual loss for boundaries, while considering texture similarity for backgrounds. We show that our proposed approach results in more realistic textures and sharper edges, and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both qualitative results on standard benchmarks and results of extensive user studies."}

Training an unpaired synthetic-to-real translation network in image space is severely under-constrained and produces visible artifacts. Instead, we propose a semi-supervised approach that operates on the disentangled shading and albedo layers of the image. Our two-stage pipeline first learns to predict accurate shading in a supervised fashion using physically-based renderings as targets, and further increases the realism of the textures and shading with an improved CycleGAN network. Extensive evaluations on the SUNCG indoor scene dataset demonstrate that our approach yields more realistic images compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, networks trained on our generated \"real\" images predict more accurate depth and normals than domain adaptation approaches, suggesting that improving the visual realism of the images can be more effective than imposing task-specific losses."}

Catastrophic forgetting occurs when a trained network is not able to maintain its ability to accomplish previously learned tasks when it is trained to perform new tasks. We study the problem of lifelong learning for generative models, extending a trained network to new conditional generation tasks without forgetting previous tasks, while assuming access to the training data for the current task only. In contrast to state-of-the-art memory replay based approaches which are limited to label-conditioned image generation tasks, a more generic framework for continual learning of generative models under different conditional image generation settings is proposed in this paper. Lifelong GAN employs knowledge distillation to transfer learned knowledge from previous networks to the new network. This makes it possible to perform image-conditioned generation tasks in a lifelong learning setting. We validate Lifelong GAN for both image-conditioned and label-conditioned generation tasks, and provide qualitative and quantitative results to show the generality and effectiveness of our method."}

These methods are traditionally based on a temporal series of stereo images. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular 3D scene flow estimation method, called Mono-SF. Mono-SF jointly estimates the 3D structure and motion of the scene by combining multi-view geometry and single-view depth information. Mono-SF considers that the scene flow should be consistent in terms of warping the reference image in the consecutive image based on the principles of multi-view geometry. For integrating single-view depth in a statistical manner, a convolutional neural network, called ProbDepthNet, is proposed. ProbDepthNet estimates pixel-wise depth distributions from a single image rather than single depth values. Additionally, as part of ProbDepthNet, a novel recalibration technique for regression problems is proposed to ensure well-calibrated distributions. Our experiments show that Mono-SF outperforms state-of-the-art monocular baselines and ablation studies support the Mono-SF approach and ProbDepthNet design."}

Towards these capabilities, we present a probabilistic forecasting model of future interactions between a variable number of agents. We perform both standard forecasting and the novel task of conditional forecasting, which reasons about how all agents will likely respond to the goal of a controlled agent (here, the AV). We train models on real and simulated data to forecast vehicle trajectories given past positions and LIDAR. Our evaluation shows that our model is substantially more accurate in multi-agent driving scenarios compared to existing state-of-the-art. Beyond its general ability to perform conditional forecasting queries, we show that our model's predictions of all agents improve when conditioned on knowledge of the AV's goal, further illustrating its capability to model agent interactions."}

In this paper, we develop a novel deep neural network, named LPD-Net (Large-scale Place Description Network), which can extract discriminative and generalizable global descriptors from the raw 3D point cloud. Two modules, the adaptive local feature extraction module and the graph-based neighborhood aggregation module, are proposed, which contribute to extract the local structures and reveal the spatial distribution of local features in the large-scale point cloud, with an end-to-end manner. We implement the proposed global descriptor in solving point cloud based retrieval tasks to achieve the large-scale place recognition. Comparison results show that our LPD-Net is much better than PointNetVLAD and reaches the state-of-the-art. We also compare our LPD-Net with the vision-based solutions to show the robustness of our approach to different weather and light conditions."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2019", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Local Supports Global", "Title": "Deep Camera Relocalization With Sequence Enhancement", "Abstract": "We propose to leverage the local information in a image sequence to support global camera relocalization. In contrast to previous methods that regress global poses from single images, we exploit the spatial-temporal consistency in sequential images to alleviate uncertainty due to visual ambiguities by incorporating a visual odometry (VO) component. Specifically, we introduce two effective steps called content-augmented pose estimation and motion-based refinement. The content-augmentation step focuses on alleviating the uncertainty of pose estimation by augmenting the observation based on the co-visibility in local maps built by the VO stream. Besides, the motion-based refinement is formulated as a pose graph, where the camera poses are further optimized by adopting relative poses provided by the VO component as additional motion constraints. Thus, the global consistency can be guaranteed. Experiments on the public indoor 7-Scenes and outdoor Oxford RobotCar benchmark datasets demonstrate that benefited from local information inherent in the sequence, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in some challenging cases, e.g., insufficient texture, highly repetitive textures, similar appearances, and over-exposure."}

Sparse feature and deep learning based methods have been successful and dominant over the decade. However, most of them do not explicitly leverage high-level semantic information to deal with challenging scenarios where they may fail. This paper proposes a novel visual place recognition algorithm, termed TextPlace, based on scene texts in the wild. Since scene texts are high-level information invariant to illumination changes and very distinct for different places when considering spatial correlation, it is beneficial for visual place recognition tasks under extreme appearance changes and perceptual aliasing. It also takes spatial-temporal dependence between scene texts into account for topological localization. Extensive experiments show that TextPlace achieves state-of-the-art performance, verifying the effectiveness of using high-level scene texts for robust visual place recognition in urban areas."}

Recently, retrieval-based methods have been considered as a promising direction as they can be easily generalized to novel scenes. Despite significant progress has been made, we observe that the performance bottleneck of previous methods actually lies in the retrieval module. These methods use the same features for both retrieval and relative pose regression tasks which have potential conflicts in learning. To this end, here we present a coarse-to-fine retrieval-based deep learning framework, which includes three steps, i.e., image-based coarse retrieval, pose-based fine retrieval and precise relative pose regression. With our carefully designed retrieval module, the relative pose regression task can be surprisingly simpler. We design novel retrieval losses with batch hard sampling criterion and two-stage retrieval to locate samples that adapt to the relative pose regression task. Extensive experiments show that our model (CamNet) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on both indoor and outdoor datasets."}

Current attempts to automate this pro- cess typically focus on simple scenarios, estimate independent maps per frame or do not have the level of precision required by modern self driving vehicles. In contrast, in this paper we focus on drawing the lane boundaries of complex highways with many lanes that contain topology changes due to forks and merges. Towards this goal, we formulate the problem as inference in a directed acyclic graphical model (DAG), where the nodes of the graph encode geo- metric and topological properties of the local regions of the lane boundaries. Since we do not know a priori the topology of the lanes, we also infer the DAG topology (i.e., nodes and edges) for each region. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two major North American Highways in two different states and show high precision and recall as well as 89% correct topology."}

This work marks a first attempt to address this task with on-board sensing without assuming a known constant lane width or relying on pre-mapped environments. Our network architecture, 3D-LaneNet, applies two new concepts: intra-network inverse-perspective mapping (IPM) and anchor-based lane representation. The intra-network IPM projection facilitates a dual-representation information flow in both regular image-view and top-view. An anchor-per-column output representation enables our end-to-end approach which replaces common heuristics such as clustering and outlier rejection, casting lane estimation as an object detection problem. In addition, our approach explicitly handles complex situations such as lane merges and splits. Results are shown on two new 3D lane datasets, a synthetic and a real one. For comparison with existing methods, we test our approach on the image-only tuSimple lane detection benchmark, achieving performance competitive with state-of-the-art."}

Based on the first optimization-based attacking method, many following methods are proposed to improve the attacking performance and speed. Recently, generation-based methods have received much attention since they directly use feed-forward networks to generate the adversarial samples, which avoid the time-consuming iterative attacking procedure in optimization-based and gradient-based methods. However, current generation-based methods are only able to attack one specific target (category) within one model, thus making them not applicable to real classification systems that often have hundreds/thousands of categories. In this paper, we propose the first Multi-target Adversarial Network (MAN), which can generate multi-target adversarial samples with a single model. By incorporating the specified category information into the intermediate features, it can attack any category of the target classification model during runtime. Experiments show that the proposed MAN can produce stronger attack results and also have better transferability than previous state-of-the-art methods in both multi-target attack task and single-target attack task. We further use the adversarial samples generated by our MAN to improve the robustness of the classification model. It can also achieve better classification accuracy than other methods when attacked by various methods."}

Due to varying distances between cameras and persons of interest, resolution mismatch can be expected, which would degrade person re-ID performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel generative adversarial network to address cross-resolution person re-ID, allowing query images with varying resolutions. By advancing adversarial learning techniques, our proposed model learns resolution-invariant image representations while being able to recover the missing details in low-resolution input images. The resulting features can be jointly applied for improving person re-ID performance due to preserving resolution invariance and recovering re-ID oriented discriminative details. Our experiments on five benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods, especially when the input resolutions are unseen during training."}

In this paper, we investigate a new perspective of facial landmark detection and demonstrate it leads to further notable improvement. Given that any face images can be factored into space of style that captures lighting, texture and image environment, and a style-invariant structure space, our key idea is to leverage disentangled style and shape space of each individual to augment existing structures via style translation. With these augmented synthetic samples, our semi-supervised model surprisingly outperforms the fully-supervised one by a large margin. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our idea with state-of-the-art results on WFLW, 300W, COFW, and AFLW datasets.

While many recent attempts at factor disentanglement have focused on sophisticated learning objectives within the VAE framework, their choice of a standard normal as the latent factor prior is both suboptimal and detrimental to performance. Our key observation is that the disentangled latent variables responsible for major sources of variability, the relevant factors, can be more appropriately modeled using long-tail distributions. The typical Gaussian priors are, on the other hand, better suited for modeling of nuisance factors. Motivated by this, we extend the VAE to a hierarchical Bayesian model by introducing hyper-priors on the variances of Gaussian latent priors, mimicking an infinite mixture, while maintaining tractable learning and inference of the traditional VAEs. This analysis signifies the importance of partitioning and treating in a different manner the latent dimensions corresponding to relevant factors and nuisances. Our proposed models, dubbed Bayes-Factor-VAEs, are shown to outperform existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of latent disentanglement across several challenging benchmark tasks."}

Its design is critical for dense prediction tasks such as object detection and semantic/instance segmentation. In this work, we propose Content-Aware ReAssembly of FEatures (CARAFE), a universal, lightweight and highly effective operator to fulfill this goal. CARAFE has several appealing properties: (1) Large field of view. Unlike previous works (e.g. bilinear interpolation) that only exploit subpixel neighborhood, CARAFE can aggregate contextual information within a large receptive field. (2) Content-aware handling. Instead of using a fixed kernel for all samples (e.g. deconvolution), CARAFE enables instance-specific content-aware handling, which generates adaptive kernels on-the-fly.

We consider the reason is twofold: 1. the weaker discriminative feature learned by conventional methods; 2. the significant appearance difference between two images domains. To tackle these problems, we propose an aggregated feature difference learning network (AFD-Net). Unlike other methods that merely rely on the high-level features, we find the feature differences in other levels also provide useful learning information. Thus, the multi-level feature differences are aggregated to enhance the discrimination. To make features invariant across different domains, we introduce a domain invariant feature extraction network based on instance normalization (IN). In order to optimize the AFD-Net, we borrow the large margin cosine loss which can minimize intra-class distance and maximize inter-class distance between matching and non-matching samples. Extensive experiments show that AFD-Net largely outperforms the state-of-the-arts on the cross-spectral dataset, meanwhile, demonstrates a considerable generalizability on a single spectral dataset."}

In this paper, we study Siamese networks from a new perspective and question the validity of their training procedure. We show that in the majority of cases, the objective of a Siamese network is endowed with an invariance property. Neglecting the invariance property leads to a hindrance in training the Siamese networks. To alleviate this issue, we propose two Riemannian structures and generalize a well-established accelerated stochastic gradient descent method to take into account the proposed Riemannian structures. Our empirical evaluations suggest that by making use of the Riemannian geometry, we achieve state-of-the-art results against several algorithms for the challenging problem of fine-grained image classification."}

However, the degradations in real-world LR images are far more complicated. As a consequence, the SISR models trained on simulated data become less effective when applied to practical scenarios. In this paper, we build a real-world super-resolution (RealSR) dataset where paired LR-HR images on the same scene are captured by adjusting the focal length of a digital camera. An image registration algorithm is developed to progressively align the image pairs at different resolutions. Considering that the degradation kernels are naturally non-uniform in our dataset, we present a Laplacian pyramid based kernel prediction network (LP-KPN), which efficiently learns per-pixel kernels to recover the HR image. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SISR models trained on our RealSR dataset deliver better visual quality with sharper edges and finer textures on real-world scenes than those trained on simulated datasets. Though our RealSR dataset is built by using only two cameras (Canon 5D3 and Nikon D810), the trained model generalizes well to other camera devices such as Sony a7II and mobile phones."}

To further improve the visual quality of super-resolved results, PIRM2018-SR Challenge employed perceptual metrics to assess the perceptual quality, such as PI, NIQE, and Ma. However, existing methods cannot directly optimize these indifferentiable perceptual metrics, which are shown to be highly correlated with human ratings. To address the problem, we propose Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks with Ranker (RankSRGAN) to optimize generator in the direction of perceptual metrics. Specifically, we first train a Ranker which can learn the behavior of perceptual metrics and then introduce a novel rank-content loss to optimize the perceptual quality. The most appealing part is that the proposed method can combine the strengths of different SR methods to generate better results. Extensive experiments show that RankSRGAN achieves visually pleasing results and reaches state-of-the-art performance in perceptual metrics.

Consequently, UHD HDR broadcasting and streaming have emerged as high quality premium services. However, due to the lack of original UHD HDR video content, appropriate conversion technologies are urgently needed to transform the legacy low resolution (LR) standard dynamic range (SDR) videos into UHD HDR versions. In this paper, we propose a joint super-resolution (SR) and inverse tone-mapping (ITM) framework, called Deep SR-ITM, which learns the direct mapping from LR SDR video to their HR HDR version. Joint SR and ITM is an intricate task, where high frequency details must be restored for SR, jointly with the local contrast, for ITM. Our network is able to restore fine details by decomposing the input image and focusing on the separate base (low frequency) and detail (high frequency) layers. Moreover, the proposed modulation blocks apply location-variant operations to enhance local contrast. The Deep SR-ITM shows good subjective quality with increased contrast and details, outperforming the previous joint SR-ITM method."}

Moreover, we model the probabilistic dependence between the image codes using a conditional entropy model.

The long-standing additive white Gaussian and heteroscedastic (signal-dependent) noise models widely used in the literature provide only a coarse approximation of real sensor noise. This paper introduces Noise Flow, a powerful and accurate noise model based on recent normalizing flow architectures. Noise Flow combines well-established basic parametric noise models (e.g., signal-dependent noise) with the flexibility and expressiveness of normalizing flow networks. The result is a single, comprehensive, compact noise model containing fewer than 2500 parameters yet able to represent multiple cameras and gain factors. Noise Flow dramatically outperforms existing noise models, with 0.42 nats/pixel improvement over the camera-calibrated noise level functions, which translates to 52% improvement in the likelihood of sampled noise. Noise Flow represents the first serious attempt to go beyond simple parametric models to one that leverages the power of deep learning and data-driven noise distributions."}

Our key insight is that sharing features makes the network more compact, induces better feature representations, and can better exploit interactions among these tasks to handle partially labeled data. With a shared encoder, we can flexibly add decoders for different tasks during training. This modular design leads to a compact and efficient model at inference time. Exploiting the interactions among these tasks allows us to introduce distillation and self-supervised losses in addition to supervised losses, which can better handle partially labeled real-world data. SENSE achieves state-of-the-art results on several optical flow benchmarks and runs as fast as networks specifically designed for optical flow. It also compares favorably against the state of the art on stereo and scene flow, while consuming much less memory."}

To date, the objective is fixed a-priori at training time, and any variation to it requires re-training a new network. In this paper we present a first attempt at alleviating the need for re-training. Rather than fixing the network at training time, we train a \"Dynamic-Net\" that can be modified at inference time. Our approach considers an \"objective-space\" as the space of all linear combinations of two objectives, and the Dynamic-Net is emulating the traversing of this objective-space at test-time, without any further training. We show that this upgrades pre-trained networks by providing an out-of-learning extension, while maintaining the performance quality. The solution we propose is fast and allows a user to interactively modify the network, in real-time, in order to obtain the result he/she desires. We show the benefits of such an approach via several different applications."}

We define the search space for the generator architectural variations and use an RNN controller to guide the search, with parameter sharing and dynamic-resetting to accelerate the process. Inception score is adopted as the reward, and a multi-level search strategy is introduced to perform NAS in a progressive way. Experiments validate the effectiveness of AutoGAN on the task of unconditional image generation.

This notion is inspired by an observation in the decoding process of deep image matting where indices-guided unpooling can often recover boundary details considerably better than other upsampling operators such as bilinear interpolation. By viewing the indices as a function of the feature map, we introduce the concept of 'learning to index', and present a novel index-guided encoder-decoder framework where indices are self-learned adaptively from data and are used to guide the pooling and upsampling operators, without extra training supervision. At the core of this framework is a flexible network module, termed IndexNet, which dynamically generates indices conditioned on the feature map. Due to its flexibility, IndexNet can be used as a plug-in applying to almost all off-the-shelf convolutional networks that have coupled downsampling and upsampling stages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndexNet on the task of natural image matting where the quality of learned indices can be visually observed from predicted alpha mattes. Results on the Composition-1k matting dataset show that our model built on MobileNetv2 exhibits at least 16.1% improvement over the seminal VGG-16 based deep matting baseline, with less training data and lower model capacity.

Unlike previous multi-stage algorithms that generally learn in a coarse-to-fine fashion, each stage of LAP-Net learns different levels of haze with different supervision. Then the network can progressively learn the gradually aggravating haze. With this design, each stage can focus on a region with specific haze level and restore clear details. To effectively fuse the results of varying haze levels at different stages, we develop an adaptive integration strategy to yield the final dehazed image. This strategy is achieved by a hierarchical integration scheme, which is in cooperation with the memory network and the domain knowledge of dehazing to highlight the best-restored regions of each stage. Extensive experiments on both real-world images and two dehazing benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method."}

We use a simple stochastic structure sampling method for training the PruningNet. Then, we apply an evolutionary procedure to search for good-performing pruned networks. The search is highly efficient because the weights are directly generated by the trained PruningNet and we do not need any finetuning at search time. With a single PruningNet trained for the target network, we can search for various Pruned Networks under different constraints with little human participation.

In this paper, we present Harmonious Bottleneck on two Orthogonal dimensions (HBO), a novel architecture unit, specially tailored to boost the accuracy of extremely lightweight MobileNets at the level of less than 40 MFLOPs. Unlike existing bottleneck designs that mainly focus on exploring the interdependencies among the channels of either groupwise or depthwise convolutional features, our HBO improves bottleneck representation while maintaining similar complexity via jointly encoding the feature interdependencies across both spatial and channel dimensions. It has two reciprocal components, namely spatial contraction-expansion and channel expansion-contraction, nested in a bilaterally symmetric structure. The combination of two interdependent transformations performing on orthogonal dimensions of feature maps enhances the representation and generalization ability of our proposed module, guaranteeing compelling performance with limited computational resource and power. By replacing the original bottlenecks in MobileNetV2 backbone with HBO modules, we construct HBONets which are evaluated on ImageNet classification, PASCAL VOC object detection and Market-1501 person re-identification.

Different from prior work which requires specifically designed noise-robust loss functions or networks, O2U-net is easy to implement but effective. It only requires adjusting the hyper-parameters of the deep network to make its status transfer from overfitting to underfitting (O2U) cyclically. The losses of each sample are recorded during iterations. The higher the normalized average loss of a sample, the higher the probability of being noisy labels. O2U-net is naturally compatible with active learning and other human annotation approaches. This introduces extra flexibility for learning with noisy labels. We conduct sufficient experiments on multiple datasets in various settings. The experimental results prove the state-of-the-art of O2S-net."}

We design four cascaded modules including multi-label classification, object detection, instance refinement and instance segmentation, which are implemented sequentially by sharing the same backbone. The cascaded pipeline is trained alternatively with a curriculum learning strategy that generalizes labels from high level images to low-level pixels gradually with increasing accuracy. In addition, we design a proposal calibration module to explore the ability of classification networks to find key pixels that identify object parts, which serves as a post validation strategy running in the inverse order. We evaluate the efficiency of our Label-PEnet in mining instance masks on standard benchmarks: PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012.

However, for discriminative tasks, there is a possibility that these layers lose the discriminative details due to improper pooling strategies, which could hinder the learning process and eventually result in suboptimal models. In this paper, we present a unified framework over the existing downsampling layers (e.g., average pooling, max pooling, and strided convolution) from a local importance view. In this framework, we analyze the issues of these widely-used pooling layers and figure out the criteria for designing an effective downsampling layer. According to this analysis, we propose a conceptually simple, general, and effective pooling layer based on local importance modeling, termed as Local Importance-based Pooling (LIP). LIP can automatically enhance discriminative features during the downsampling procedure by learning adaptive importance weights based on inputs. Experiment results show that LIP consistently yields notable gains with different depths and different architectures on ImageNet classification. In the challenging MS COCO dataset, detectors with our LIP-ResNets as backbones obtain a consistent improvement (>=1.4%) over the vanilla ResNets, and especially achieve the current state-of-the-art performance in detecting small objects under the single-scale testing scheme."}

In this paper, we explore the idea of hard attention aimed for latency-sensitive applications. Instead of reasoning about every frame separately, our method selects and only processes a small sub-window of the frame. Our technique then makes predictions for the full frame based on the sub-windows from previous frames and the update from the current sub-window. The latency reduction by this hard attention mechanism comes at the cost of degraded accuracy. We made two contributions to address this. First, we propose a specialized memory cell that recovers lost context when processing sub-windows. Secondly, we adopt a Q-learning-based policy training strategy that enables our approach to intelligently select the sub-windows such that the staleness in the memory hurts the performance the least. Our experiments suggest that our approach reduces the latency by approximately four times without significantly sacrificing the accuracy on the ImageNet VID video object detection dataset and the DAVIS video object segmentation dataset. We further demonstrate that we can reinvest the saved computation into other parts of the network, and thus resulting in an accuracy increase at a comparable computational cost as the original system and beating other recently proposed state-of-the-art methods in the low latency range."}

They provide an efficient and effective way to utilize visual information selectively, which has shown to be especially valuable in multi-modal learning tasks. However, all prior attention frameworks lack the ability to explicitly model structural dependencies among attention variables, making it difficult to predict consistent attention masks. In this paper we develop a novel structured spatial attention mechanism which is end-to-end trainable and can be integrated with any feed-forward convolutional neural network. This proposed AttentionRNN layer explicitly enforces structure over the spatial attention variables by sequentially predicting attention values in the spatial mask in a bi-directional raster-scan and inverse raster-scan order. As a result, each attention value depends not only on local image or contextual information, but also on the previously predicted attention values. Our experiments show consistent quantitative and qualitative improvements on a variety of recognition tasks and datasets; including image categorization, question answering and image generation."}

Similarly, the output feature maps of a convolution layer can also be seen as a mixture of information at different frequencies. In this work, we propose to factorize the mixed feature maps by their frequencies, and design a novel Octave Convolution (OctConv) operation to store and process feature maps that vary spatially \"slower\" at a lower spatial resolution reducing both memory and computation cost. Unlike existing multi-scale methods, OctConv is formulated as a single, generic, plug-and-play convolutional unit that can be used as a direct replacement of (vanilla) convolutions without any adjustments in the network architecture. It is also orthogonal and complementary to methods that suggest better topologies or reduce channel-wise redundancy like group or depth-wise convolutions. We experimentally show that by simply replacing convolutions with OctConv, we can consistently boost accuracy for both image and video recognition tasks, while reducing memory and computational cost. An OctConv-equipped ResNet-152 can achieve 82.9% top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet with merely 22.2 GFLOPs."}

Due to the topological variability of real 3D models, they often lie close to a disconnected manifold, which cannot be learned with a common learning algorithm. Therefore, our tool is based on a new deep learning model, DiscoNet, which extends 3D surface autoencoders in two ways. Firstly, our deep learning model uses several autoencoders to automatically learn each connected component of a disconnected manifold, without any supervision. Secondly, each autoencoder infers the output 3D surface by deforming a pre-learned 3D template specific to each connected component. Both advances translate into improved 3D synthesis, thus enhancing the quality of our 3D editing tool."}

Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and its variants provide simple and easily-implemented iterative methods for this task, but these algorithms can converge to spurious local optima. To address local optima and other difficulties in the ICP pipeline, we propose a learning-based method, titled Deep Closest Point (DCP), inspired by recent techniques in computer vision and natural language processing. Our model consists of three parts: a point cloud embedding network, an attention-based module combined with a pointer generation layer to approximate combinatorial matching, and a differentiable singular value decomposition (SVD) layer to extract the final rigid transformation. We train our model end-to-end on the ModelNet40 dataset and show in several settings that it performs better than ICP, its variants (e.g., Go-ICP, FGR), and the recently-proposed learning-based method PointNetLK. Beyond providing a state-of-the-art registration technique, we evaluate the suitability of our learned features transferred to unseen objects.

We propose a Harmonic Densely Connected Network to achieve high efficiency in terms of both low MACs and memory traffic. The new network achieves 35%, 36%, 30%, 32%, and 45% inference time reduction compared with FC-DenseNet-103, DenseNet-264, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, and SSD-VGG, respectively. We use tools including Nvidia profiler and ARM Scale-Sim to measure the memory traffic and verify that the inference latency is indeed proportional to the memory traffic consumption and the proposed network consumes low memory traffic. We conclude that one should take memory traffic into consideration when designing neural network architectures for high-resolution applications at the edge."}

Existing algorithms usually formulate it as a semantic-visual correspondence problem, by learning mappings from one feature space to the other. Despite being reasonable, previous approaches essentially discard the highly precious discriminative power of visual features in an implicit way, and thus produce undesirable results. We instead reformulate ZSL as a conditioned visual classification problem, i.e., classifying visual features based on the classifiers learned from the semantic descriptions. With this reformulation, we develop algorithms targeting various ZSL settings: For the conventional setting, we propose to train a deep neural network that directly generates visual feature classifiers from the semantic attributes with an episode-based training scheme; For the generalized setting, we concatenate the learned highly discriminative classifiers for seen classes and the generated classifiers for unseen classes to classify visual features of all classes; For the transductive setting, we exploit unlabeled data to effectively calibrate the classifier generator using a novel learning-without-forgetting self-training mechanism and guide the process by a robust generalized cross-entropy loss. Extensive experiments show that our proposed algorithms significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods by large margins on most benchmark datasets in all the ZSL settings."}

However, when training with small minibatches, models using BN exhibit a significant degradation in performance. In this paper we study this peculiar behavior of BN to gain a better understanding of the problem, and identify a cause. We propose `EvalNorm' to address the issue by estimating corrected normalization statistics to use for BN during evaluation. EvalNorm supports online estimation of the corrected statistics while the model is being trained, and does not affect the training scheme of the model. As a result, EvalNorm can also be used with existing pre-trained models allowing them to benefit from our method. EvalNorm yields large gains for models trained with smaller batches.

In order to extend the applications' boundaries to some accuracy-crucial domains, researchers have been investigating approaches to boost accuracy through either deeper or wider network structures, which brings with them the exponential increment of the computational and storage cost, delaying the responding time. In this paper, we propose a general training framework named self distillation, which notably enhances the performance (accuracy) of convolutional neural networks through shrinking the size of the network rather than aggrandizing it. Different from traditional knowledge distillation - a knowledge transformation methodology among networks, which forces student neural networks to approximate the softmax layer outputs of pre-trained teacher neural networks, the proposed self distillation framework distills knowledge within network itself. The networks are firstly divided into several sections. Then the knowledge in the deeper portion of the networks is squeezed into the shallow ones. Experiments further prove the generalization of the proposed self distillation framework: enhancement of accuracy at average level is 2.65%, varying from 0.61% in ResNeXt as minimum to 4.07% in VGG19 as maximum. In addition, it can also provide flexibility of depth-wise scalable inference on resource-limited edge devices. Our codes have been released on github."}

To solve this challenging problem, meta-learning has become a popular paradigm that advocates the ability to \"learn to adapt\". Recent works have shown, however, that simple learning strategies without meta-learning could be competitive. In this paper, we go a step further and show that by addressing the fundamental high-variance issue of few-shot learning classifiers, it is possible to significantly outperform current meta-learning techniques. Our approach consists of designing an ensemble of deep networks to leverage the variance of the classifiers, and introducing new strategies to encourage the networks to cooperate, while encouraging prediction diversity. Evaluation is conducted on the mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet and CUB datasets, where we show that even a single network obtained by distillation yields state-of-the-art results."}

Because reID is different from classification, the architecture should be modified accordingly. We propose to automatically search for a CNN architecture that is specifically suitable for the reID task. There are three aspects to be tackled. First, body structural information plays an important role in reID but it is not encoded in backbones. Second, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the process of architecture design without human effort, but no existing NAS methods incorporate the structure information of input images. Third, reID is essentially a retrieval task but current NAS algorithms are merely designed for classification. To solve these problems, we propose a retrieval-based search algorithm over a specifically designed reID search space, named Auto-ReID. Our Auto-ReID enables the automated approach to find an efficient and effective CNN architecture for reID. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the searched architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing 50% parameters and 53% FLOPs compared to others."}

The method interleaves sampling and consolidation of the current data interpretation via repetitive hypothesis proposal, fast rejection, and integration of the new hypothesis into the kept instance set by labeling energy minimization. Due to exploring the data progressively, the method has several beneficial properties compared with the state-of-the-art. First, a clear criterion, adopted from RANSAC, controls the termination and stops the algorithm when the probability of finding a new model with a reasonable number of inliers falls below a threshold. Second, Prog-X is an any-time algorithm. Thus, whenever is interrupted, e.g. due to a time limit, the returned instances cover real and, likely, the most dominant ones. The method is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy in both synthetic experiments and on publicly available real-world datasets for homography, two-view motion, and motion segmentation."}

The features of interiors should be invariant to strong appearance change so as to pop-out the salient object as a whole, while the features of boundaries should be selective to slight appearance change to distinguish salient objects and background. To address this selectivity-invariance dilemma, we propose a novel boundary-aware network with successive dilation for image-based SOD. In this network, the feature selectivity at boundaries is enhanced by incorporating a boundary localization stream, while the feature invariance at interiors is guaranteed with a complex interior perception stream. Moreover, a transition compensation stream is adopted to amend the probable failures in transitional regions between interiors and boundaries. In particular, an integrated successive dilation module is proposed to enhance the feature invariance at interiors and transitional regions. Extensive experiments on six datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms 16 state-of-the-art methods."}

Current bottom-up proposal generation methods can generate proposals with precise boundary, but cannot efficiently generate adequately reliable confidence scores for retrieving proposals. To address these difficulties, we introduce the Boundary-Matching (BM) mechanism to evaluate confidence scores of densely distributed proposals, which denote a proposal as a matching pair of starting and ending boundaries and combine all densely distributed BM pairs into the BM confidence map. Based on BM mechanism, we propose an effective, efficient and end-to-end proposal generation method, named Boundary-Matching Network (BMN), which generates proposals with precise temporal boundaries as well as reliable confidence scores simultaneously. The two-branches of BMN are jointly trained in an unified framework. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-1.3, where BMN shows significant performance improvement with remarkable efficiency and generalizability. Further, combining with existing action classifier, BMN can achieve state-of-the-art temporal action detection performance."}

Relying on the Mask R-CNN backbone, we extract mask proposals per frame and formulate the matching between object templates and proposals as a linear assignment problem where thA heading inside a blocke cost matrix is predicted by a deep convolutional neural network. We propose a differentiable matching layer which unrolls a projected gradient descent algorithm in which the projection step exploits the Dykstra's algorithm. We prove that under mild conditions, the matching is guaranteed to converge to the optimal one. In practice, it achieves similar performance compared to the Hungarian algorithm during inference. Meanwhile, we can back-propagate through it to learn the cost matrix. After matching, a U-Net style architecture is exploited to refine the matched mask per time step. On DAVIS 2017 dataset, DMM-Net achieves the best performance without online learning on the first frames and the 2nd best with it. Without any fine-tuning, DMM-Net performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods on SegTrack v2 dataset. At last, our differentiable matching layer is very simple to implement; we attach the PyTorch code in the supplementary material which is less than 50 lines long."}

However, DNNs are found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted inputs aiming to mislead a learner to make incorrect predictions. While several defense and detection approaches are proposed for static image classification, many security-critical tasks use videos as their input and require efficient processing. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective method advIT to detect adversarial frames within videos against different types of attacks based on temporal consistency property of videos. In particular, we apply optical flow estimation to the target and previous frames to generate pseudo frames and evaluate the consistency of the learner output between these pseudo frames and target. High inconsistency indicates that the target frame is adversarial. We conduct extensive experiments on various learning tasks including video semantic segmentation, human pose estimation, object detection, and action recognition, and demonstrate that we can achieve above 95% adversarial frame detection rate. To consider adaptive attackers, we show that even if an adversary has access to the detector and performs a strong adaptive attack based on the state of the art expectation of transformation method, the detection rate stays almost the same. We also tested the transferability among different optical flow estimators and show that it is hard for attackers to attack one and transfer the perturbation to others. In addition, as efficiency is important in video analysis, we show that advIT can achieve real-time detection in about 0.03--0.4 seconds."}

Matching based and propagation based methods run at a faster speed by avoiding OL techniques. However, they are limited by sub-optimal accuracy, due to mismatching and drifting problems. In this paper, we develop a real-time yet very accurate Ranking Attention Network (RANet) for VOS. Specifically, to integrate the insights of matching based and propagation based methods, we employ an encoder-decoder framework to learn pixel-level similarity and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. To better utilize the similarity maps, we propose a novel ranking attention module, which automatically ranks and selects these maps for fine-grained VOS performance. Experiments on DAVIS16 and DAVIS17 datasets show that our RANet achieves the best speed-accuracy trade-off, e.g., with 33 milliseconds per frame and J&F=85.5% on DAVIS16. With OL, our RANet reaches J&F=87.1% on DAVIS16, exceeding state-of-the-art VOS methods. The code can be found at https://github.com/Storife/RANet."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2019", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Bridging the Gap Between Detection and Tracking", "Title": "A Unified Approach", "Abstract": "Object detection models have been a source of inspiration for many tracking-by-detection algorithms over the past decade. Recent deep trackers borrow designs or modules from the latest object detection methods, such as bounding box regression, RPN and ROI pooling, and can deliver impressive performance. In this paper, instead of redesigning a new tracking-by-detection algorithm, we aim to explore a general framework for building trackers directly upon almost any advanced object detector. To achieve this, three key gaps must be bridged: (1) Object detectors are class-specific, while trackers are class-agnostic. (2) Object detectors do not differentiate intra-class instances, while this is a critical capability of a tracker. (3) Temporal cues are important for stable long-term tracking while they are not considered in still-image detectors. To address the above issues, we first present a simple target-guidance module for guiding the detector to locate target-relevant objects. Then a meta-learner is adopted for the detector to fast learn and adapt a target-distractor classifier online. We further introduce an anchored updating strategy to alleviate the problem of overfitting. The framework is instantiated on SSD and FasterRCNN, the typical one- and two-stage detectors, respectively. Experiments on OTB, UAV123 and NfS have verified our framework and show that our trackers can benefit from deeper backbone networks, as opposed to many recent trackers."}

This task is usually termed snapshot compressive-spectral imaging (SCI), which enjoys low cost, low bandwidth and high-speed sensing rate via capturing the three-dimensional (3D) signal i.e., (x, y, l), using a 2D snapshot. Though proposed more than a decade ago, the poor quality and low-speed of reconstruction algorithms preclude wide applications of SCI. To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop a dual-stage generative model to reconstruct the desired 3D signal in SCI, dubbed l-net. Results on both simulation and real datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of l-net, which leads to >4dB improvement in PSNR for real-mask-in-the-loop simulation data compared to the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, l-net can finish the reconstruction task within sub-seconds instead of hours taken by the most recently proposed DeSCI algorithm, thus speeding up the reconstruction >1000 times."}

However, the perceptual quality of the restored image is relatively subjective, and it is necessary for users to control the reconstruction result according to personal preferences or image characteristics, which cannot be done using existing deterministic networks. This motivates us to exquisitely design a unified interactive framework for general image restoration tasks. Under this framework, users can control continuous transition of different objectives, e.g., the perception-distortion trade-off of image super-resolution, the trade-off between noise reduction and detail preservation. We achieve this goal by controlling the latent features of the designed network. To be specific, our proposed framework, named Controllable Feature Space Network (CFSNet), is entangled by two branches based on different objectives. Our framework can adaptively learn the coupling coefficients of different layers and channels, which provides finer control of the restored image quality. Experiments on several typical image restoration tasks fully validate the effective benefits of the proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/qibao77/CFSNet."}

The top performers in this field include deep or wide convolutional neural networks, or recurrent neural networks. However, the methods enforce a single model to process all kinds of textures and structures. A typical operation is that a certain layer restores the textures based on the ones recovered by the preceding layers, ignoring the characteristics of image textures. In this paper, we believe that the lower-frequency and higher-frequency information in images have different levels of complexity and should be restored by models of different representational capacity. Inspired by this, we propose a novel embedded block residual network (EBRN) which is an incremental recovering progress for texture super-resolution. Specifically, different modules in the model restores information of different frequencies. For lower-frequency information, we use shallower modules of the network to recover; for higher-frequency information, we use deeper modules to restore. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed EBRN model achieves superior performance and visual improvements against the state-of-the-arts."}

Much prior work uses either a supervised mode of learning or stereo images. The former is limited by the amount of labeled data, as it requires expensive sensors, while the latter is not always readily available as monocular sequences. In this work, we demonstrate the benefit of using geometric information from synthetic images, coupled with scene depth information, to recover the scale in depth and ego-motion estimation from monocular videos. We developed our framework using synthetic image-depth pairs and unlabeled real monocular images. We had three training objectives: first, to use deep feature alignment to reduce the domain gap between synthetic and monocular images to yield more accurate depth estimation when presented with only real monocular images at test time. Second, we learn scene specific representation by exploiting self-supervision coming from multi-view synthetic images without the need for depth labels. Third, our method uses single-view depth and pose networks, which are capable of jointly training and supervising one another mutually, yielding consistent depth and ego-motion estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our depth and ego-motion models surpass the state-of-the-art, unsupervised methods and compare favorably to early supervised deep models for geometric understanding. We validate the effectiveness of our training objectives against standard benchmarks thorough an ablation study."}

We capture intra-modal dependencies using a separate graph neural network for each modality (visual and lingual), and then use conditional message-passing in another graph neural network to fuse their outputs and capture cross-modal relationships. This final representation results in grounding decisions. The framework supports many-to-many matching and is able to ground single phrase to multiple image regions and vice versa.

Unlike previous learning based methods, we explicitly constraint the smoothness of depth maps by using conditional random fields (CRFs) after the stage of cost volume regularization. The CRFs module is implemented as recurrent neural networks so that the whole pipeline can be trained end-to-end. Our results show that the proposed pipeline outperforms previous state-of-the-arts on large-scale DTU dataset.

NG-RANSAC uses prior information to improve model hypothesis search, increasing the chance of finding outlier-free minimal sets. Previous works use heuristic side-information like hand-crafted descriptor distance to guide hypothesis search. In contrast, we learn hypothesis search in a principled fashion that lets us optimize an arbitrary task loss during training, leading to large improvements on classic computer vision tasks. We present two further extensions to NG-RANSAC. Firstly, using the inlier count itself as training signal allows us to train neural guidance in a self-supervised fashion. Secondly, we combine neural guidance with differentiable RANSAC to build neural networks which focus on certain parts of the input data and make the output predictions as good as possible. We evaluate NG-RANSAC on a wide array of computer vision tasks, namely estimation of epipolar geometry, horizon line estimation and camera re-localization. We achieve superior or competitive results compared to state-of-the-art robust estimators, including very recent, learned ones."}

Towards this goal, we developed a differentiable PatchMatch module that allows us to discard most disparities without requiring full cost volume evaluation. We then exploit this representation to learn which range to prune for each pixel. By progressively reducing the search space and effectively propagating such information, we are able to efficiently compute the cost volume for high likelihood hypotheses and achieve savings in both memory and computation.Finally, an image guided refinement module is exploited to further improve the performance.

However, each natural image has its own internal statistics, captured by its unique distribution of patches. In this paper we propose an \"Internal GAN\" (InGAN) -- an image-specific GAN -- which trains on a single input image and learns its internal distribution of patches. It is then able to synthesize a plethora of new natural images of significantly different sizes, shapes and aspect-ratios - all with the same internal patch-distribution (same \"DNA\") as the input image. In particular, despite large changes in global size/shape of the image, all elements inside the image maintain their local size/shape. InGAN is fully unsupervised, requiring no additional data other than the input image itself. Once trained on the input image, it can remap the input to any size or shape in a single feedforward pass, while preserving the same internal patch distribution. InGAN provides a unified framework for a variety of tasks, bridging the gap between textures and natural images."}

Inspired by such behavior and the fact that machines also have computational constraints, we propose COnditional COordinate GAN (COCO-GAN) of which the generator generates images by parts based on their spatial coordinates as the condition. On the other hand, the discriminator learns to justify realism across multiple assembled patches by global coherence, local appearance, and edge-crossing continuity. Despite the full images are never manipulated during training, we show that COCO-GAN can produce state-of-the-art-quality full images during inference. We further demonstrate a variety of novel applications enabled by our coordinate-aware framework. First, we perform extrapolation to the learned coordinate manifold and generate off-the-boundary patches. Combining with the originally generated full image, COCO-GAN can produce images that are larger than training samples, which we called \"beyond-boundary generation\". We then showcase panorama generation within a cylindrical coordinate system that inherently preserves horizontally cyclic topology. On the computation side, COCO-GAN has a built-in divide-and-conquer paradigm that reduces memory requisition during training and inference, provides high-parallelism, and can generate parts of images on-demand."}

At the same time, generative models were proposed that can generate highly realistic images. However, despite this success in these closely related tasks, texture reconstruction of 3D objects has received little attention from the research community and state-of-the-art methods are either limited to comparably low resolution or constrained experimental setups. A major reason for these limitations is that common representations of texture are inefficient or hard to interface for modern deep learning techniques. In this paper, we propose Texture Fields, a novel texture representation which is based on regressing a continuous 3D function parameterized with a neural network. Our approach circumvents limiting factors like shape discretization and parameterization, as the proposed texture representation is independent of the shape representation of the 3D object. We show that Texture Fields are able to represent high frequency texture and naturally blend with modern deep learning techniques. Experimentally, we find that Texture Fields compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods for conditional texture reconstruction of 3D objects and enable learning of probabilistic generative models for texturing unseen 3D models. We believe that Texture Fields will become an important building block for the next generation of generative 3D models."}

Despite the recent success of deep learning models in discriminative tasks of point clouds, generating point clouds remains challenging. This paper proposes a principled probabilistic framework to generate 3D point clouds by modeling them as a distribution of distributions. Specifically, we learn a two-level hierarchy of distributions where the first level is the distribution of shapes and the second level is the distribution of points given a shape. This formulation allows us to both sample shapes and sample an arbitrary number of points from a shape. Our generative model, named PointFlow, learns each level of the distribution with a continuous normalizing flow. The invertibility of normalizing flows enables the computation of the likelihood during training and allows us to train our model in the variational inference framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that PointFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud generation. We additionally show that our model can faithfully reconstruct point clouds and learn useful representations in an unsupervised manner.

If the real dataset comes with a small labeled validation set, we additionally aim to optimize a meta-objective, i.e. downstream task performance.

SinGAN contains a pyramid of fully convolutional GANs, each responsible for learning the patch distribution at a different scale of the image. This allows generating new samples of arbitrary size and aspect ratio, that have significant variability, yet maintain both the global structure and the fine textures of the training image. In contrast to previous single image GAN schemes, our approach is not limited to texture images, and is not conditional (i.e. it generates samples from noise). User studies confirm that the generated samples are commonly confused to be real images. We illustrate the utility of SinGAN in a wide range of image manipulation tasks."}

The performance of our knowledge-enabled VQA model is evaluated on our newly introduced dataset, viz. text-KVQA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset which identifies the need for bridging text recognition with knowledge graph based reasoning. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed method outperforms traditional VQA as well as question-answering over knowledge base-based methods on text-KVQA."}

Compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), it only requires two additional forward-mode automatic differentiation operations per iteration, which has a computational cost comparable to two standard forward passes and is easy to implement. Our method addresses long-standing issues with current second-order solvers, which invert an approximate Hessian matrix every iteration exactly or by conjugate-gradient methods, procedures that are much slower than a SGD step. Instead, we propose to keep a single estimate of the gradient projected by the inverse Hessian matrix, and update it once per iteration with just two passes over the network. This estimate has the same size and is similar to the momentum variable that is commonly used in  SGD . No estimate of the Hessian is maintained. We first validate our method, called CurveBall, on small problems with known solutions (noisy Rosenbrock function and degenerate 2-layer linear networks), where current deep learning solvers struggle. We then train several large models on CIFAR and ImageNet, including ResNet and VGG-f networks, where we demonstrate faster convergence with no hyperparameter tuning. We also show our optimiser's generality by testing on a large set of randomly generated architectures."}

However, the majority of adversarial attacks assume global, fine-grained control over the image pixel space. In this paper, we consider a different setting: what happens if the adversary could only alter specific attributes of the input image? These would generate inputs that might be perceptibly different, but still natural-looking and enough to fool a classifier. We propose a novel approach to generate such \"semantic\" adversarial examples by optimizing a particular adversarial loss over the range-space of a parametric conditional generative model. We demonstrate implementations of our attacks on binary classifiers trained on face images, and show that such natural-looking semantic adversarial examples exist. We evaluate the effectiveness of our attack on synthetic and real data, and present detailed comparisons with existing attack methods. We supplement our empirical results with theoretical bounds that demonstrate the existence of such parametric adversarial examples."}

They have proposed various hard negative sample mining strategies, but very few addressed this problem from the perspective of loss functions. Our research shows that the conventional Siamese and triplet losses treat all samples linearly, thus make the training time consuming. Instead, we propose the exponential Siamese and triplet losses, which can naturally focus more on hard samples and put less emphasis on easy ones, meanwhile, speed up the optimization. To assist the exponential losses, we introduce the hard positive sample mining to further enhance the effectiveness. The extensive experiments demonstrate our proposal improves both metric and descriptor learning on several well accepted benchmarks, and outperforms the state-of-the-arts on the UBC dataset. Moreover, it also shows a better generalizability on cross-spectral image matching and image retrieval tasks."}

However, due to the discreteness of low-bit quantization, existing quantization methods often face the unstable training process and severe performance degradation. To address this problem, in this paper we propose Differentiable Soft Quantization (DSQ) to bridge the gap between the full-precision and low-bit networks. DSQ can automatically evolve during training to gradually approximate the standard quantization. Owing to its differentiable property, DSQ can help pursue the accurate gradients in backward propagation, and reduce the quantization loss in forward process with an appropriate clipping range. Extensive experiments over several popular network structures show that training low-bit neural networks with DSQ can consistently outperform state-of-the-art quantization methods. Besides, our first efficient implementation for deploying 2 to 4-bit DSQ on devices with ARM architecture achieves up to 1.7x speed up, compared with the open-source 8-bit high-performance inference framework NCNN [31]."}

Adversarial attacks formally correspond to an optimization problem: find a minimum norm image perturbation, constrained to cause misclassification. A number of effective attacks have been developed. However, to date, no gradient-based attacks have used best practices from the optimization literature to solve this constrained minimization problem. We design a new untargeted attack, based on these best practices, using the well-regarded logarithmic barrier method. On average, our attack distance is similar or better than all state-of-the-art attacks on benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet-1K). In addition, our method performs significantly better on the most challenging images, those which normally require larger perturbations for misclassification. We employ the LogBarrier attack on several adversarially defended models, and show that it adversarially perturbs all images more efficiently than other attacks: the distance needed to perturb all images is significantly smaller with the LogBarrier attack than with other state-of-the-art attacks."}

While many current methods offer tools to perform this analysis for a given (trained) network post-hoc, recent results (especially on capsule networks) suggest that when classes map to a few high level \"concepts\" in the preceding layers of the network, the behavior of the network is easier to interpret or explain. Such training may be accomplished via dynamic/EM routing where the network \"routes\" for individual classes (or subsets of images) are dynamic and involve few nodes even if the full network may not be sparse. In this paper, we show how a simple modification of the SGD scheme can help provide dynamic/EM routing type behavior in convolutional neural networks. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate the effect of this idea for interpretability where we obtain promising results, while also showing that no compromise in attainable accuracy is involved. Further, we show that the minor modification is seemingly ad-hoc, the new algorithm can be analyzed by an approximate method which provably matches known rates for SGD."}

Here, an attacker cannot access confidence scores, but only the final label. Most attacks for this scenario are either unreliable or inefficient. Focusing on the latter, we show that a specific class of attacks, Boundary Attacks, can be reinterpreted as a biased sampling framework that gains efficiency from domain knowledge. We identify three such biases, image frequency, regional masks and surrogate gradients, and evaluate their performance against an ImageNet classifier. We show that the combination of these biases outperforms the state of the art by a wide margin. We also showcase an efficient way to attack the Google Cloud Vision API, where we craft convincing perturbations with just a few hundred queries. Finally, the methods we propose have also been found to work very well against strong defenses: Our targeted attack won second place in the NeurIPS 2018 Adversarial Vision Challenge."}

We introduce the concept of targeted mismatch attack for deep learning based retrieval systems to generate an adversarial image to conceal the query image. The generated image looks nothing like the user intended query, but leads to identical or very similar retrieval results. Transferring attacks to fully unseen networks is challenging. We show successful attacks to partially unknown systems, by designing various loss functions for the adversarial image construction. These include loss functions, for example, for unknown global pooling operation or unknown input resolution by the retrieval system. We evaluate the attacks on standard retrieval benchmarks and compare the results retrieved with the original and adversarial image."}

This question presents an intriguing new computer vision challenge. We introduce Fashion++, an approach that proposes minimal adjustments to a full-body clothing outfit that will have maximal impact on its fashionability. Our model consists of a deep image generation neural network that learns to synthesize clothing conditioned on learned per-garment encodings. The latent encodings are explicitly factorized according to shape and texture, thereby allowing direct edits for both fit/presentation and color/patterns/material, respectively. We show how to bootstrap Web photos to automatically train a fashionability model, and develop an activation maximization-style approach to transform the input image into its more fashionable self. The edits suggested range from swapping in a new garment to tweaking its color, how it is worn (e.g., rolling up sleeves), or its fit (e.g., making pants baggier). Experiments demonstrate that Fashion++ provides successful edits, both according to automated metrics and human opinion."}

In this work, we propose a new task along this research direction, we call few-shot common-localization. Given a few weakly-supervised support images, we aim to localize the common object in the query image without any box annotation. This task differs from standard few-shot settings, since we aim to address the localization problem, rather than the global classification problem. To tackle this new problem, we propose a network that aims to get the most out of the support and query images. To that end, we introduce a spatial similarity module that searches the spatial commonality among the given images. We furthermore introduce a feature reweighting module to balance the influence of different support images through graph convolutional networks. To evaluate few-shot common-localization, we repurpose and reorganize the well-known Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets, as well as a video dataset from ImageNet VID. Experiments on the new settings for few-shot common-localization shows the importance of searching for spatial similarity and feature reweighting, outperforming baselines from related tasks."}

Recent deep models for image retrieval have outperformed traditional methods by leveraging ranking-tailored loss functions, but important theoretical and practical problems remain. First, rather than directly optimizing the global ranking, they minimize an upper-bound on the essential loss, which does not necessarily result in an optimal mean average precision (mAP). Second, these methods require significant engineering efforts to work well, e.g., special pre-training and hard-negative mining. In this paper we propose instead to directly optimize the global mAP by leveraging recent advances in listwise loss formulations. Using a histogram binning approximation, the AP can be differentiated and thus employed to end-to-end learning. Compared to existing losses, the proposed method considers thousands of images simultaneously at each iteration and eliminates the need for ad hoc tricks. It also establishes a new state of the art on many standard retrieval benchmarks. Models and evaluation scripts have been made available at: https://europe.naverlabs.com/Deep-Image-Retrieval/."}

When labelled training data is available, network weights and activations have successfully been quantized down to 1-bit. The same cannot be said about the scenario when labelled training data is not available, e.g. when quantizing a pre-trained model, where current approaches show, at best, no loss of accuracy at 8-bit quantizations. We introduce DSConv, a flexible quantized convolution operator that replaces single-precision operations with their far less expensive integer counterparts, while maintaining the probability distributions over both the kernel weights and the outputs. We test our model as a plug-and-play replacement for standard convolution on most popular neural network architectures, ResNet, DenseNet, GoogLeNet, AlexNet and VGG-Net and demonstrate state-of-the-art results, with less than 1% loss of accuracy, without retraining, using only 4-bit quantization. We also show how a distillation-based adaptation stage with unlabelled data can improve results even further."}

It also supports back propagation and is trainable end-to end. By adding this operator, we introduce a new way to combine top-down and bottom-up information in semantic segmentation. Our experiments show the effectiveness of IMP on both clothing parsing (with complex layering, large deformations, and non-convex objects), and on street scene segmentation (with many overlapping instances and small objects). On the Varied Clothing Parsing dataset (VCP), we show instance mask projection can improve mIOU by 3 points over a state-of-the-art Panoptic FPN segmentation approach. On the ModaNet clothing parsing dataset, we show a dramatic improvement of 20.4% compared to existing baseline semantic segmentation results. In addition, the Instance Mask Projection operator works well on other (non-clothing) datasets, providing an improvement in mIOU of 3 points on \"thing\" classes of Cityscapes, a self-driving dataset, over a state-of-the-art approach."}

The multi-scale context module refers to the operations to aggregate feature responses from a large spatial extent, while the single-stage encoder-decoder structure encodes the high-level semantic information in the encoder path and recovers the boundary information in the decoder path. In contrast, multi-stage encoder-decoder networks have been widely used in human pose estimation and show superior performance than their single-stage counterpart. However, few efforts have been attempted to bring this effective design to semantic segmentation. In this work, we propose a Semantic Prediction Guidance (SPG) module which learns to re-weight the local features through the guidance from pixel-wise semantic prediction. We find that by carefully re-weighting features across stages, a two-stage encoder-decoder network coupled with our proposed SPG module can significantly outperform its one-stage counterpart with similar parameters and computations. Finally, we report experimental results on the semantic segmentation benchmark Cityscapes, in which our SPGNet attains 81.1% on the test set using only 'fine' annotations."}

This however may not be ideal as they contain very different type of information relevant for recognition. Here, we propose a new two-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires shape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that processes information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this architecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the two streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical stream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively removing noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the relevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow architecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution. Our experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that produces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts performance on thinner and smaller objects. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cityscapes benchmark, in terms of both mask (mIoU) and boundary (F-score) quality, improving by 2% and 4% over strong baselines."}

A thorough grasp of the elusive shape requires sufficiently contextual semantic information, yet few works devote to this. Here we propose DensePoint, a general architecture to learn densely contextual representation for point cloud processing. Technically, it extends regular grid CNN to irregular point configuration by generalizing a convolution operator, which holds the permutation invariance of points, and achieves efficient inductive learning of local patterns. Architecturally, it finds inspiration from dense connection mode, to repeatedly aggregate multi-level and multi-scale semantics in a deep hierarchy. As a result, densely contextual information along with rich semantics, can be acquired by DensePoint in an organic manner, making it highly effective. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across four tasks, as well as thorough model analysis, verify DensePoint achieves the state of the arts."}

It utilizes multi-resolution average pooling on base embeddings masked with the label to act as a positive proxy for the new class, while fusing it with the previously learned class signatures. Our method is evaluated on PASCAL-5^i dataset and outperforms the state-of-the-art in the few-shot semantic segmentation. Unlike previous methods, our approach does not require a second branch to estimate parameters or prototypes, which enables it to be used with 2-stream motion and appearance based segmentation networks. We further propose a novel setup for evaluating continual learning of object segmentation which we name incremental PASCAL (iPASCAL) where our method outperforms the baseline method.

However, all existing NDVR datasets are introduced for long videos. Furthermore, most of them are small-scale and lack of diversity due to the high cost of collecting and labeling near-duplicate videos. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale short video dataset, called SVD, for the NDVR task. SVD contains over 500,000 short videos and over 30,000 labeled videos of near-duplicates. We use multiple video mining techniques to construct positive/negative pairs. Furthermore, we design temporal and spatial transformations to mimic user-attack behavior in real applications for constructing more difficult variants of SVD. Experiments show that existing state-of-the-art NDVR methods, including real-value based and hashing based methods, fail to achieve satisfactory performance on this challenging dataset. The release of SVD dataset will foster research and system engineering in the NDVR area. The SVD dataset is available at https://svdbase.github.io."}

However, full-image annotations are expensive, with experts spending up to 90 minutes per image. We propose block sub-image annotation as a replacement for full-image annotation. Despite the attention cost of frequent task switching, we find that block annotations can be crowdsourced at higher quality compared to full-image annotation with equal monetary cost using existing annotation tools developed for full-image annotation. Surprisingly, we find that 50% pixels annotated with blocks allows semantic segmentation to achieve equivalent performance to 100% pixels annotated. Furthermore, as little as 12% of pixels annotated allows performance as high as 98% of the performance with dense annotation. In weakly-supervised settings, block annotation outperforms existing methods by 3-4% (absolute) given equivalent annotation time. To recover the necessary global structure for applications such as characterizing spatial context and affordance relationships, we propose an effective method to inpaint block-annotated images with high-quality labels without additional human effort. As such, fewer annotations can also be used for these applications compared to full-image annotation."}

We show that trained models significantly amplify the association of target labels with gender beyond what one would expect from biased datasets. Surprisingly, we show that even when datasets are balanced such that each label co-occurs equally with each gender, learned models amplify the association between labels and gender, as much as if data had not been balanced! To mitigate this, we adopt an adversarial approach to remove unwanted features corresponding to protected variables from intermediate representations in a deep neural network - and provide a detailed analysis of its effectiveness. Experiments on two datasets: the COCO dataset (objects), and the imSitu dataset (actions), show reductions in gender bias amplification while maintaining most of the accuracy of the original models."}

Our approach is easy to implement and fast to execute, making it easily deployable. FAX uses an image-translation network which recovers geometry at the original resolution of the image. Counterintuitively, the main loss which drives FAX is on per-pixel surface normals instead of per-pixel depth, making it possible to estimate detailed body geometry without any depth supervision. We evaluate our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively, and compare with a state-of-the-art method."}

In particular, we focus on the problem of capturing 3D information about Grevy's zebras from a collection of images. The Grevy's zebra is one of the most endangered species in Africa, with only a few thousand individuals left. Capturing the shape and pose of these animals can provide biologists and conservationists with information about animal health and behavior. In contrast to research on human pose, shape and texture estimation, training data for endangered species is limited, the animals are in complex natural scenes with occlusion, they are naturally camouflaged, travel in herds, and look similar to each other. To overcome these challenges, we integrate the recent SMAL animal model into a network-based regression pipeline, which we train end-to-end on synthetically generated images with pose, shape, and background variation. Going beyond state-of-the-art methods for human shape and pose estimation, our method learns a shape space for zebras during training. Learning such a shape space from images using only a photometric loss is novel, and the approach can be used to learn shape in other settings with limited 3D supervision. Moreover, we couple 3D pose and shape prediction with the task of texture synthesis, obtaining a full texture map of the animal from a single image. We show that the predicted texture map allows a novel per-instance unsupervised optimization over the network features. This method, SMALST (SMAL with learned Shape and Texture) goes beyond previous work, which assumed manual keypoints and/or segmentation, to regress directly from pixels to 3D animal shape, pose and texture."}

However, while state-of-the-art methods are able to output complex 3D geometry, it is not clear how to extend these results to time-varying topologies. Approaches treating each time step individually lack continuity and exhibit slow inference, while traditional 4D reconstruction methods often utilize a template model or discretize the 4D space at fixed resolution. In this work, we present Occupancy Flow, a novel spatio-temporal representation of time-varying 3D geometry with implicit correspondences. Towards this goal, we learn a temporally and spatially continuous vector field which assigns a motion vector to every point in space and time. In order to perform dense 4D reconstruction from images or sparse point clouds, we combine our method with a continuous 3D representation. Implicitly, our model yields correspondences over time, thus enabling fast inference while providing a sound physical description of the temporal dynamics. We show that our method can be used for interpolation and reconstruction tasks, and demonstrate the accuracy of the learned correspondences. We believe that Occupancy Flow is a promising new 4D representation which will be useful for a variety of spatio-temporal reconstruction tasks."}

In contrast, existing human motion capture (mocap) datasets are small and the motions limited, hampering progress on learning models of human motion. While there are many different datasets available, they each use a different parameterization of the body, making it difficult to integrate them into a single meta dataset. To address this, we introduce AMASS, a large and varied database of human motion that unifies 15 different optical marker-based mocap datasets by representing them within a common framework and parameterization. We achieve this using a new method, MoSh++, that converts mocap data into realistic 3D human meshes represented by a rigged body model. Here we use SMPL [Loper et al., 2015], which is widely used and provides a standard skeletal representation as well as a fully rigged surface mesh. The method works for arbitrary marker sets, while recovering soft-tissue dynamics and realistic hand motion. We evaluate MoSh++ and tune its hyperparameters using a new dataset of 4D body scans that are jointly recorded with markerbased mocap. The consistent representation of AMASS makes it readily useful for animation, visualization, and generating training data for deep learning. Our dataset is significantly richer than previous human motion collections, having more than 40 hours of motion data, spanning over 300 subjects, more than 11000 motions, and will be publicly available to the research community."}

In this paper, we take one step forward to show that fine-grained person perception is possible even with 1D sensors: WiFi antennas. Specifically, we used two sets of WiFi antennas to acquire signals, i.e., one transmitter set and one receiver set. Each set contains three antennas horizontally lined-up as a regular household WiFi router. The WiFi signal generated by a transmitter antenna, penetrates through and reflects on human bodies, furniture, and walls, and then superposes at a receiver antenna as 1D signal samples. We developed a deep learning approach that uses annotations on 2D images, takes the received 1D WiFi signals as input, and performs body segmentation and pose estimation in an end-to-end manner. To our knowledge, our solution is the first work based on off-the-shelf WiFi antennas and standard IEEE 802.11n WiFi signals. Demonstrating comparable results to image-based solutions, our WiFi-based person perception solution is cheaper and more ubiquitous than radars and LiDARs, while invariant to illumination and has little privacy concern comparing to cameras."}

However, these algorithms are neither accurate nor stable in motion-blurred videos. The missing of structure information makes it difficult for state-of-the-art facial landmark detection algorithms to yield good results. In this paper, we propose a framework named FAB that takes advantage of structure consistency in the temporal dimension for facial landmark detection in motion-blurred videos. A structure predictor is proposed to predict the missing face structural information temporally, which serves as a geometry prior. This allows our framework to work as a virtuous circle. On one hand, the geometry prior helps our structure-aware deblurring network generates high quality deblurred images which lead to better landmark detection results. On the other hand, better landmark detection results help structure predictor generate better geometry prior for the next frame. Moreover, it is a flexible video-based framework that can incorporate any static image-based methods to provide a performance boost on video datasets. Extensive experiments on Blurred-300VW, the proposed Real-world Motion Blur (RWMB) datasets and 300VW demonstrate the superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods.

We train the architecture with three modalities -- RGB, Flow and Audio -- and combine them with mid-level fusion alongside sparse temporal sampling of fused representations. In contrast with previous works, modalities are fused before temporal aggregation, with shared modality fusion weights over time. Our proposed architecture is trained end-to-end, outperforming individual modalities as well as late-fusion of modalities. We demonstrate the importance of audio in egocentric vision, on per-class basis, for identifying actions as well as interacting objects.

Previous methods aim to localize action starts by learning feature representations that can directly separate the start point from its preceding background. It is challenging due to the subtle appearance difference near the action starts and the lack of training data. Instead, StartNet decomposes ODAS into two stages: action classification (using ClsNet) and start point localization (using LocNet). ClsNet focuses on per-frame labeling and predicts action score distributions online. Based on the predicted action scores of the past and current frames, LocNet conducts class-agnostic start detection by optimizing long-term localization rewards using policy gradient methods. The proposed framework is validated on two large-scale datasets, THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet. The experimental results show that StartNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by 15%-30% p-mAP under the offset tolerance of 1-10 seconds on THUMOS'14, and achieves comparable performance on ActivityNet with 10 times smaller time offset."}

The joint learning framework ensures that the predicted future embeddings are informative to the action anticipation task. Furthermore, through extensive experimental evaluations we demonstrate the utility of using both visual and temporal semantics of the scene, and illustrate how this representation synthesis could be achieved through a recurrent Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework.

Despite this, the most widely adopted perceptual metrics today, such as SSIM and FSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to consider many factors of human perception. Recently, the facial modeling community has observed that the inclusion of both structure and texture has a significant positive benefit for face sketch synthesis (FSS). But how perceptual are these so-called \"perceptual features\"? Which elements are critical for their success? In this paper, we design a perceptual metric, called Structure Co-Occurrence Texture (Scoot), which simultaneously considers the block-level spatial structure and co-occurrence texture statistics. To test the quality of metrics, we propose three novel meta-measures based on various reliable properties. Extensive experiments verify that our Scoot metric exceeds the performance of prior work. Besides, we built the first largest scale (152k judgments) human-perception-based sketch database that can evaluate how well a metric consistent with human perception. Our results suggest that \"spatial structure\" and \"co-occurrence texture\" are two generally applicable perceptual features in face sketch synthesis."}

By interpreting the de-raining encoder-decoder network as a conditional generator, within which the decoder acts as a generator conditioned on the embedding learned by the encoder, the unsatisfactory output can be attributed to the low-quality embedding learned by the encoder. In this paper, we hypothesize that there exists an inherent mapping between the low-quality embedding to a latent optimal one, with which the generator (decoder) can produce much better results. To improve the de-raining results significantly over existing models, we propose to learn this mapping by formulating a residual learning branch, that is capable of adaptively adding residuals to the original low-quality embedding in a representation entanglement manner. Using an embedding learned this way, the decoder is able to generate much more satisfactory de-raining results with better detail recovery and rain artefacts removal, providing new state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets with considerable improvement (i.e., on the challenging Rain100H data, an improvement of 4.19dB on PSNR and 5% on SSIM is obtained). The entanglement can be easily adopted into any encoder-decoder based image restoration networks. Besides, we propose a series of evaluation metrics to investigate the specific contribution of the proposed entangled representation learning mechanism. Codes are available at ."}

Aspiring to have one unified structure that hosts diverse types of semantics, we follow the Scene Graph paradigm in 3D, generating a 3D Scene Graph. Given a 3D mesh and registered panoramic images, we construct a graph that spans the entire building and includes semantics on objects (e.g., class, material, shape and other attributes), rooms (e.g., function, illumination type, etc.) and cameras (e.g., location, etc.), as well as the relationships among these entities. However, this process is prohibitively labor heavy if done manually. To alleviate this we devise a semi-automatic framework that employs existing detection methods and enhances them using two main constraints: I. framing of query images sampled on panoramas to maximize the performance of 2D detectors, and II. multi-view consistency enforcement across 2D detections that originate in different camera locations."}

Using floorplan priors, our method jointly predicts a room layout and estimates the transformations from a set of partial 3D data. Unlike the existing methods relying on feature descriptors to establish correspondences, we exploit the 3D \"box\" structure of a typical room layout that meets the Manhattan World property. We first estimate a local layout for each partial scan separately and then combine these local layouts to form a globally aligned layout with loop closure. Without the requirement of feature matching, the proposed method enables some novel applications ranging from large or featureless scene reconstruction and modeling from sparse input. We validate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on real and synthetic scenes of various sizes and complexities. The evaluations and comparisons show superior effectiveness and accuracy of our method."}

By navigating this manifold in directions that increase memorability, we can visualize what it looks like for a particular generated image to become more memorable. The resulting \"visual definitions\" surface image properties (like \"object size\") that may underlie memorability.

Most previous approaches independently embed images and sentences into a joint embedding space and compare their similarities. However, previous approaches rarely explore the interactions between images and sentences before calculating similarities in the joint space. Intuitively, when matching between images and sentences, human beings would alternatively attend to regions in images and words in sentences, and select the most salient information considering the interaction between both modalities. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal Adaptive Message Passing (CAMP), which adaptively controls the information flow for message passing across modalities. Our approach not only takes comprehensive and fine-grained cross-modal interactions into account, but also properly handles negative pairs and irrelevant information with an adaptive gating scheme. Moreover, instead of conventional joint embedding approaches for text-image matching, we infer the matching score based on the fused features, and propose a hardest negative binary cross-entropy loss for training. Results on COCO and Flickr30k significantly surpass state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach."}

In this work, we study this challenging scenario as few-shot image and sentence matching, and accordingly propose an Aligned Cross-Modal Memory (ACMM) model to memorize the rarely appeared content. Given a pair of image and sentence, the model first includes an aligned memory controller network to produce two sets of semantically-comparable interface vectors through cross-modal alignment. Then the interface vectors are used by modality-specific read and update operations to alternatively interact with shared memory items. The memory items persistently memorize cross-modal shared semantic representations, which can be addressed out to better enhance the representation of few-shot content. We apply the proposed model to both conventional and few-shot image and sentence matching tasks, and demonstrate its effectiveness by achieving the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets."}

We represent rigid objects in local volumetric signed distance function (SDF) maps, and formulate multi-object tracking as direct alignment of RGB-D images with the SDF representations.

While recent factor graph based state optimization algorithms have shown their ability to robustly solve SLAM problems by treating dynamic objects as outliers, the dynamic motions are rarely considered. In this paper, we exploit the consensus of 3D motions among the landmarks extracted from the same rigid body for clustering and estimating static and dynamic objects in a unified manner. Specifically, our algorithm builds a noise-aware motion affinity matrix upon landmarks, and uses agglomerative clustering for distinguishing those rigid bodies. Accompanied by a decoupled factor graph optimization for revising their shape and trajectory, we obtain an iterative scheme to update both cluster assignments and motion estimation reciprocally. Evaluations on both synthetic scenes and KITTI demonstrate the capability of our approach, and further experiments considering online efficiency also show the effectiveness of our method for simultaneous tracking of ego-motion and multiple objects."}

The existing task-specific methods mainly use 2D keypoints (pose) to estimate the human body structure. However, they only expresses the position information with no abilities to characterize the personalized shape of the individual person and model the limbs rotations. In this paper, we propose to use a 3D body mesh recovery module to disentangle the pose and shape, which can not only model the joint location and rotation but also characterize the personalized body shape. To preserve the source information, such as texture, style, color, and face identity, we propose a Liquid Warping GAN with Liquid Warping Block (LWB) that propagates the source information in both image and feature spaces, and synthesizes an image with respect to the reference. Specifically, the source features are extracted by a denoising convolutional auto-encoder for characterizing the source identity well. Furthermore, our proposed method is able to support a more flexible warping from multiple sources. In addition, we build a new dataset, namely Impersonator (iPER) dataset, for the evaluation of human motion imitation, appearance transfer, and novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in several aspects, such as robustness in occlusion case and preserving face identity, shape consistency and clothes details.

Previous methods take an image and some target attributes as inputs and generate an output image with the desired attributes. However, such methods have two limitations. First, these methods assume binary-valued attributes and thus cannot yield satisfactory results for fine-grained control. Second, these methods require specifying the entire set of target attributes, even if most of the attributes would not be changed. To address these limitations, we propose RelGAN, a new method for multi-domain image-to-image translation. The key idea is to use relative attributes, which describes the desired change on selected attributes. Our method is capable of modifying images by changing particular attributes of interest in a continuous manner while preserving the other attributes. Experimental results demonstrate both the quantitative and qualitative effectiveness of our method on the tasks of facial attribute transfer and interpolation."}

Deep neural network architectures in image classification tasks struggle to disambiguate visually similar objects. Likewise, in human pose estimation symmetric body parts often confuse the network with assigning indiscriminative scores to them. This is due to the output prediction, in which only the highest confidence label is selected without taking into consideration a measure of uncertainty. In this work, we define the prediction difficulty as a relative property coming from the confidence score gap between positive and negative labels. More precisely, the proposed loss function penalizes the network to avoid the score of a false prediction being significant. To demonstrate the efficacy of our loss function, we evaluate it on two different domains: image classification and human pose estimation. We find improvements in both applications by achieving higher accuracy compared to the baseline methods."}

They have proved to be effective for guiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts of objects (e.g. leg as opposed to head of a person), thereby letting the network generalize better and have better object localization capabilities. On the other hand, current methods for regional dropout removes informative pixels on training images by overlaying a patch of either black pixels or random noise. Such removal is not desirable because it suffers from information loss causing inefficiency in training. We therefore propose the CutMix augmentation strategy: patches are cut and pasted among training images where the ground truth labels are also mixed proportionally to the area of the patches. By making efficient use of training pixels and retaining the regularization effect of regional dropout, CutMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art augmentation strategies on CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, as well as on ImageNet weakly-supervised localization task. Moreover, unlike previous augmentation methods, our CutMix-trained ImageNet classifier, when used as a pretrained model, results in consistent performance gain in Pascal detection and MS-COCO image captioning benchmarks. We also show that CutMix can improve the model robustness against input corruptions and its out-of distribution detection performance."}

Applying densely an action recognition system to every temporal clip within such videos is prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, as we show in our experiments, this results in suboptimal recognition accuracy as informative predictions from relevant clips are outnumbered by meaningless classification outputs over long uninformative sections of the video. In this paper we introduce a lightweight \"clip-sampling\" model that can efficiently identify the most salient temporal clips within a long video. We demonstrate that the computational cost of action recognition on untrimmed videos can be dramatically reduced by invoking recognition only on these most salient clips. Furthermore, we show that this yields significant gains in recognition accuracy compared to analysis of all clips or randomly selected clips. On Sports1M, our clip sampling scheme elevates the accuracy of an already state-of-the-art action classifier by 7% and reduces by more than 15 times its computational cost."}

We propose a novel locally-consistent deformable convolution, which utilizes the change in receptive fields and enforces a local coherency constraint to capture motion information effectively. Our model jointly learns spatio-temporal features (instead of using independent spatial and temporal streams). The temporal component is learned from the feature space instead of pixel space, e.g. optical flow. The produced features can be flexibly used in conjunction with other long-temporal modeling networks, e.g. ST-CNN, DilatedTCN, and ED-TCN.

By contrast, our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach is trained to calculate video-to-video similarity from refined frame-to-frame similarity matrices, so as to consider both intra- and inter-frame relations. In the proposed method, pairwise frame similarity is estimated by applying Tensor Dot (TD) followed by Chamfer Similarity (CS) on regional CNN frame features - this avoids feature aggregation before the similarity calculation between frames. Subsequently, the similarity matrix between all video frames is fed to a four-layer CNN, and then summarized using Chamfer Similarity (CS) into a video-to-video similarity score -- this avoids feature aggregation before the similarity calculation between videos and captures the temporal similarity patterns between matching frame sequences. We train the proposed network using a triplet loss scheme and evaluate it on five public benchmark datasets on four different video retrieval problems where we demonstrate large improvements in comparison to the state of the art. The implementation of ViSiL is publicly available."}

The convolution weights of KPConv are located in Euclidean space by kernel points, and applied to the input points close to them. Its capacity to use any number of kernel points gives KPConv more flexibility than fixed grid convolutions. Furthermore, these locations are continuous in space and can be learned by the network. Therefore, KPConv can be extended to deformable convolutions that learn to adapt kernel points to local geometry. Thanks to a regular subsampling strategy, KPConv is also efficient and robust to varying densities. Whether they use deformable KPConv for complex tasks, or rigid KPconv for simpler tasks, our networks outperform state-of-the-art classification and segmentation approaches on several datasets. We also offer ablation studies and visualizations to provide understanding of what has been learned by KPConv and to validate the descriptive power of deformable KPConv."}

Given a dataset with ground-truth labels and a loss function, we process images through a \"probe network\" and compute an embedding based on estimates of the Fisher information matrix associated with the probe network parameters. This provides a fixed-dimensional embedding of the task that is independent of details such as the number of classes and requires no understanding of the class label semantics. We demonstrate that this embedding is capable of predicting task similarities that match our intuition about semantic and taxonomic relations between different visual tasks. We demonstrate the practical value of this framework for the meta-task of selecting a pre-trained feature extractor for a novel task. We present a simple meta-learning framework for learning a metric on embeddings that is capable of predicting which feature extractors will perform well on which task. Selecting a feature extractor with task embedding yields performance close to the best available feature extractor, with substantially less computational effort than exhaustively training and evaluating all available models."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2019", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "SoftTriple Loss", "Title": "Deep Metric Learning Without Triplet Sampling", "Abstract": "Distance metric learning (DML) is to learn the embeddings where examples from the same class are closer than examples from different classes. It can be cast as an optimization problem with triplet constraints. Due to the vast number of triplet constraints, a sampling strategy is essential for DML. With the tremendous success of deep learning in classifications, it has been applied for DML. When learning embeddings with deep neural networks (DNNs), only a mini-batch of data is available at each iteration. The set of triplet constraints has to be sampled within the mini-batch. Since a mini-batch cannot capture the neighbors in the original set well, it makes the learned embeddings sub-optimal. On the contrary, optimizing SoftMax loss, which is a classification loss, with DNN shows a superior performance in certain DML tasks. It inspires us to investigate the formulation of SoftMax. Our analysis shows that SoftMax loss is equivalent to a smoothed triplet loss where each class has a single center. In real-world data, one class can contain several local clusters rather than a single one, e.g., birds of different poses. Therefore, we propose the SoftTriple loss to extend the SoftMax loss with multiple centers for each class. Compared with conventional deep metric learning algorithms, optimizing SoftTriple loss can learn the embeddings without the sampling phase by mildly increasing the size of the last fully connected layer. Experiments on the benchmark fine-grained data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function."}

It is able to select nodes that are significant for graph representation adaptively, and generate hierarchical features via aggregating the attention-weighted information in nodes. Additionally, we devise a hierarchical prediction architecture to sufficiently leverage the hierarchical representation and facilitate the model learning. The AttPool module together with the entire training structure can be integrated into existing GCNs, and is trained in an end-to-end fashion conveniently. The experimental results on several graph-classification benchmark datasets with various scales demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}

Although the metric learning part is well addressed, this metric is usually computed over the average of the extracted deep features. This representation is then trained to be discriminative. However, these deep features tend to be scattered across the feature space. Consequently, the representations are not robust to outliers, object occlusions, background variations, etc. In this paper, we tackle this scattering problem with a distribution-aware regularization named HORDE. This regularizer enforces visually-close images to have deep features with the same distribution which are well localized in the feature space. We provide a theoretical analysis supporting this regularization effect. We also show the effectiveness of our approach by obtaining state-of-the-art results on 4 well-known datasets (Cub-200-2011, Cars-196, Stanford Online Products and Inshop Clothes Retrieval)."}

This paper presents an efficient solution that explores the visual patterns within individual cropped regions with minimal costs. We build our framework upon a representative one-stage keypoint-based detector named CornerNet. Our approach, named CenterNet, detects each object as a triplet, rather than a pair, of keypoints, which improves both precision and recall. Accordingly, we design two customized modules, cascade corner pooling, and center pooling, that enrich information collected by both the top-left and bottom-right corners and provide more recognizable information from the central regions. On the MS-COCO dataset, CenterNet achieves an AP of 47.0 %, outperforming all existing one-stage detectors by at least 4.9%. Furthermore, with a faster inference speed than the top-ranked two-stage detectors, CenterNet demonstrates a comparable performance to these detectors.

Optimizing image classification tends to activate object parts and ignore the full object extent, while expanding object parts into full object extent could deteriorate the performance of image classification. In this paper, we propose a divergent activation (DA) approach, and target at learning complementary and discriminative visual patterns for image classification and weakly supervised object localization from the perspective of discrepancy. To this end, we design hierarchical divergent activation (HDA), which leverages the semantic discrepancy to spread feature activation, implicitly. We also propose discrepant divergent activation (DDA), which pursues object extent by learning mutually exclusive visual patterns, explicitly. Deep networks implemented with HDA and DDA, referred to as DANets, diverge and fuse discrepant yet discriminative features for image classification and object localization in an end-to-end manner. Experiments validate that DANets advance the performance of object localization while maintaining high performance of image classification on CUB-200 and ILSVRC datasets"}

From the analyses of the state-of-the-art defense method, i.e., the multi-step adversarial training [??], we hypothesize that the gradient magnitude links to the model robustness. Motivated by this, we propose to perturb both the image and the label during training, which we call Bilateral Adversarial Training (BAT). To generate the adversarial label, we derive an closed-form heuristic solution. To generate the adversarial image, we use one-step targeted attack with the target label being the most confusing class. In the experiment, we first show that random start and the most confusing target attack effectively prevent the label leaking and gradient masking problem. Then coupled with the adversarial label part, our model significantly improves the state-of-the-art results. For example, against PGD100 white-box attack with cross-entropy loss, on CIFAR10, we achieve 63.7% versus 47.2%; on SVHN, we achieve 59.1% versus 42.1%. At last, the experiment on the very (computationally) challenging ImageNet dataset further demonstrates the effectiveness of our fast method."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2019", "Area": "CV", "Where": "ICCV", "Abbreviation": "Auto-FPN", "Title": "Automatic Network Architecture Adaptation for Object Detection Beyond Classification", "Abstract": "Abstract Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great potential in automating the manual process of designing a good CNN architecture for image classification. In this paper, we study NAS for object detection, a core computer vision task that classifies and localizes object instances in an image. Existing works focus on transferring the searched architecture from classification task (ImageNet) to the detector backbone, while the rest of the architecture of the detector remains unchanged. However, this pipeline is not task-specific or data-oriented network search which cannot guarantee optimal adaptation to any dataset. Therefore, we propose an architecture search framework named Auto-FPN specifically designed for detection beyond simply searching a classification backbone. Specifically, we propose two auto search modules for detection: Auto-fusion to search a better fusion of the multi-level features; Auto-head to search a better structure for classification and bounding-box(bbox) regression. Instead of searching for one repeatable cell structure, we relax the constraint and allow different cells. The search space of both modules covers many popular designs of detectors and allows efficient gradient-based architecture search with resource constraint (2 days for COCO on 8 GPU cards). Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, BDD, VisualGenome and ADE demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, e.g. achieving around 5% improvement than FPN in terms of mAP while requiring around 50% fewer parameters on the searched modules."}

This paper proposes a position-aware relation network (PARN) to learn a more flexible and robust metric ability for few-shot learning. Relation networks (RNs), a kind of architectures for relational reasoning, can acquire a deep metric ability for images by just being designed as a simple convolutional neural network (CNN)[23]. However, due to the inherent local connectivity of CNN, the CNN-based relation network (RN) can be sensitive to the spatial position relationship of semantic objects in two compared images. To address this problem, we introduce a deformable feature extractor (DFE) to extract more efficient features, and design a dual correlation attention mechanism (DCA) to deal with its inherent local connectivity. Successfully, our proposed approach extents the potential of RN to be position-aware of semantic objects by introducing only a small number of parameters. We evaluate our approach on two major benchmark datasets, i.e., Omniglot and Mini-Imagenet, and on both of the datasets our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. It's worth noting that our 5-way 1-shot result on Omniglot even outperforms the previous 5-way 5-shot results."}

The proposed defence mechanism is inspired by the recent works mitigating the adversarial disturbances by the means of image reconstruction and denoising. However, unlike the previous works, we apply the reconstruction only for small and carefully selected image areas that are most influential to the current classification outcome. The selection process is guided by the class activation map responses obtained for multiple top-ranking class labels. The same regions are also the most prominent for the adversarial perturbations and hence most important to purify. The resulting inpainting task is substantially more tractable than the full image reconstruction, while still being able to prevent the adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we combine the selective image inpainting with wavelet based image denoising to produce a non differentiable layer that prevents attacker from using gradient backpropagation. Moreover, the proposed nonlinearity cannot be easily approximated with simple differentiable alternative as demonstrated in the experiments with Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation (BPDA) attack. Finally, we experimentally show that the proposed Class-specific Image Inpainting Defence (CIIDefence) is able to withstand several powerful adversarial attacks including the BPDA. The obtained results are consistently better compared to the other recent defence approaches."}

In the backbone part, we analyze the drawbacks in previous lightweight backbones and present a lightweight backbone designed for object detection.

To generate more discriminative feature representation, we design two efficient architecture blocks, Context Enhancement Module and Spatial Attention Module.

Benefit from the highly efficient backbone and detection part design, ThunderNet surpasses previous lightweight one-stage detectors with only 40% of the computational cost on PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Without bells and whistles, ThunderNet runs at 24.1 fps on an ARM-based device with 19.2 AP on COCO. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-time detector reported on ARM platforms.

These methods always involve two roles, an explicit or implicit teacher model and a student model, and penalize predictions under different perturbations by a consistency constraint. However, the weights of these two roles are tightly coupled since the teacher is essentially an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student. In this work, we show that the coupled EMA teacher causes a performance bottleneck. To address this problem, we introduce Dual Student, which replaces the teacher with another student. We also define a novel concept, stable sample, following which a stabilization constraint is designed for our structure to be trainable. Further, we discuss two variants of our method, which produce even higher performance. Extensive experiments show that our method improves the classification performance significantly on several main SSL benchmarks. Specifically, it reduces the error rate of the 13-layer CNN from 16.84% to 12.39% on CIFAR-10 with 1k labels and from 34.10% to 31.56% on CIFAR-100 with 10k labels.

Pedestrians across cameras with significant appearance variations are easily confused, which could bias the learned metric and slow down the convergence rate. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted complete bipartite graph based maximum-value perfect (MVP) matching for mining the hard samples from a batch of samples. It can emphasize the hard positive and negative sample pairs respectively, and thus relieve adverse optimization and sample imbalance problems. We then develop a new batch-wise MVP matching based loss objective and combine it in an end-to-end deep metric learning manner. It leads to significant improvements in both convergence rate and recognition performance. Extensive empirical results on five person re-ID benchmark datasets, i.e., Market-1501, CUHK03-Detected, CUHK03-Labeled, Duke-MTMC, and MSMT17, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Our approach draws on an insight connecting two existing works: curriculum domain adaptation and self-training. Inspired by the former, PyCDA constructs a pyramid curriculum which contains various properties about the target domain. Those properties are mainly about the desired label distributions over the target domain images, image regions, and pixels. By enforcing the segmentation neural network to observe those properties, we can improve the network's generalization capability to the target domain. Motivated by the self-training, we infer this pyramid of properties by resorting to the semantic segmentation network itself. Unlike prior work, we do not need to maintain any additional models (e.g., logistic regression or discriminator networks) or to solve minmax problems which are often difficult to optimize. We report state-of-the-art results for the adaptation from both GTAV and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, two popular settings in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation."}

To achieve that, we design a densely connected network with learnable connections, named Fully Dense Network, which contains a large set of possible final connectivity structures. We then employ gradient descent to search the optimal connectivity from the dense connections. The search process is guided by a novel loss function, which pushes the weight of each connection to be binary and the connections to be sparse. The discovered connectivity achieves competitive results on two segmentation datasets, while runs more than three times faster and requires less than half parameters compared to the state-of-the-art methods. An extensive experiment shows that the discovered connectivity is compatible with various backbones and generalizes well to other dense image prediction tasks."}

Between each cascade stage, DeCaFA uses multiple chained transfer layers with spatial softmax to produce landmark-wise attention maps for each of several landmark alignment tasks. Weighted intermediate supervision, as well as efficient feature fusion between the stages allow to learn to progressively refine the attention maps in an end-to-end manner.

To realize a working GAN network, we construct an up-down-up expansion unit in the generator for upsampling point features with error feedback and self-correction, and formulate a self-attention unit to enhance the feature integration. Further, we design a compound loss with adversarial, uniform and reconstruction terms, to encourage the discriminator to learn more latent patterns and enhance the output point distribution uniformity. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the quality of our results over the state-of-the-arts in terms of distribution uniformity, proximity-to-surface, and 3D reconstruction quality."}

In this paper, we focus on 3D deformable shapes that share a common topological structure, such as human faces and bodies. Morphable Models and their variants, despite their linear formulation, have been widely used for shape representation, while most of the recently proposed nonlinear approaches resort to intermediate representations, such as 3D voxel grids or 2D views. In this work, we introduce a novel graph convolutional operator, acting directly on the 3D mesh, that explicitly models the inductive bias of the fixed underlying graph. This is achieved by enforcing consistent local orderings of the vertices of the graph, through the spiral operator, thus breaking the permutation invariance property that is adopted by all the prior work on Graph Neural Networks. Our operator comes by construction with desirable properties (anisotropic, topology-aware, lightweight, easy-to-optimise), and by using it as a building block for traditional deep generative architectures, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on a variety of 3D shape datasets compared to the linear Morphable Model and other graph convolutional operators."}

Concerning this, we propose a deep-learning based optical flow method designed to handle heavy rain. We introduce a feature multiplier in our network that transforms the features of an image affected by the rain veiling effect into features that are less affected by it, which we call veiling-invariant features. We establish a new mapping operation in the feature space to produce streak-invariant features. The operation is based on a feature pyramid structure of the input images, and the basic idea is to preserve the chromatic features of the background scenes while canceling the rain-streak patterns. Both the veiling-invariant and streak-invariant features are computed and optimized automatically based on the the accuracy of our optical flow estimation. Our network is end-to-end, and handles both rain streaks and the veiling effect in an integrated framework. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms the state of the art method and other baseline methods. We also show that our network can robustly maintain good performance on clean (no rain) images even though it is trained under rain image data."}

The GridDehazeNet consists of three modules: pre-processing, backbone, and post-processing. The trainable pre-processing module can generate learned inputs with better diversity and more pertinent features as compared to those derived inputs produced by hand-selected pre-processing methods. The backbone module implements a novel attention-based multi-scale estimation on a grid network, which can effectively alleviate the bottleneck issue often encountered in the conventional multi-scale approach. The post-processing module helps to reduce the artifacts in the final output. Experimental results indicate that the GridDehazeNet outperforms the state-of-the-arts on both synthetic and real-world images. The proposed hazing method does not rely on the atmosphere scattering model, and we provide an explanation as to why it is not necessarily beneficial to take advantage of the dimension reduction offered by the atmosphere scattering model for image dehazing, even if only the dehazing results on synthetic images are concerned."}

Yet humans understand a scene not in terms of pixels, but by decomposing it into perceptual groups and structures that are the basic building blocks of recognition. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end pixel-wise metric learning approach that mimics this process. In our approach, the optimal visual representation determines the right segmentation within individual images and associates segments with the same semantic classes across images. The core visual learning problem is therefore to maximize the similarity within segments and minimize the similarity between segments. Given a model trained this way, inference is performed consistently by extracting pixel-wise embeddings and clustering, with the semantic label determined by the majority vote of its nearest neighbors from an annotated set. As a result, we present the SegSort, as a first attempt using deep learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation, achieving 76% performance of its supervised counterpart. When supervision is available, SegSort shows consistent improvements over conventional approaches based on pixel-wise softmax training. Additionally, our approach produces more precise boundaries and consistent region predictions. The proposed SegSort further produces an interpretable result, as each choice of label can be easily understood from the retrieved nearest segments."}

Supervised deep learning methods have made great progress in solving scene parsing problems, however, come at the cost of laborious manual pixel-level annotation. Synthetic data as well as weak supervision have been investigated to alleviate this effort. Nonetheless, synthetically generated data still suffers from severe domain shift while weak labels often lack precision. Moreover, most existing works for weakly supervised scene parsing are limited to salient foreground objects. The aim of this work is hence twofold: Exploit synthetic data where feasible and integrate weak supervision where necessary. More concretely, we address this goal by utilizing depth as transfer domain because its synthetic-to-real discrepancy is much lower than for color. At the same time, we perform weak localization from easily obtainable image level labels and integrate both using a novel contour-based scheme. Our approach is implemented as a teacher-student learning framework to solve the transfer learning problem by generating a pseudo ground truth. Using only depth-based adaptation, this approach already outperforms previous transfer learning approaches on the popular indoor scene parsing SUN RGB-D dataset. Our proposed two-stage integration more than halves the gap towards fully supervised methods when compared to previous state-of-the-art in transfer learning."}

The network adapts to the input point with a help of AdaIN layers [??], thus producing different masks for different objects on the same image. AdaptIS generates pixel-accurate object masks, therefore it accurately segments objects of complex shape or severely occluded ones. AdaptIS can be easily combined with standard semantic segmentation pipeline to perform panoptic segmentation. To illustrate the idea, we perform experiments on a challenging toy problem with difficult occlusions. Then we extensively evaluate the method on panoptic segmentation benchmarks. We obtain state-of-the-art results on Cityscapes and Mapillary even without pretraining on COCO, and show competitive results on a challenging COCO dataset.

For semantic segmentation in particular, it helps deploy on real \"target domain\" data models that are trained on annotated images from a different \"source domain\", notably a virtual environment. To this end, most previous works consider semantic segmentation as the only mode of supervision for source domain data, while ignoring other, possibly available, information like depth. In this work, we aim at exploiting at best such a privileged information while training the UDA model. We propose a unified depth-aware UDA framework that leverages in several complementary ways the knowledge of dense depth in the source domain. As a result, the performance of the trained semantic segmentation model on the target domain is boosted. Our novel approach indeed achieves state-of-the-art performance on different challenging synthetic-2-real benchmarks."}

Given an input, potentially incomplete, 3D scene and a query location, our method predicts a probability distribution over object types that fit well in that location. Our distribution is predicted though passing learned messages in a dense graph whose nodes represent objects in the input scene and edges represent spatial and structural relationships. By weighting messages through an attention mechanism, our method learns to focus on the most relevant surrounding scene context to predict new scene objects. We found that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of correctly predicting objects missing in a scene based on our experiments in the SUNCG dataset. We also demonstrate other applications of our method, including context-based 3D object recognition and iterative scene generation."}

Two words co-occur visually if both words apply to the same image or image region. Specifically, we extract four types of visual co-occurrences between object and attribute words from large-scale, textually-annotated visual databases like VisualGenome and ImageNet. We then train a multi-task log-bilinear model that compactly encodes word \"meanings\" represented by each co-occurrence type into a single visual word-vector. Through unsupervised clustering, supervised partitioning, and a zero-shot-like generalization analysis we show that our word embeddings complement text-only embeddings like GloVe by better representing similarities and differences between visual concepts that are difficult to obtain from text corpora alone. We further evaluate our embeddings on five downstream applications, four of which are vision-language tasks. Augmenting GloVe with our embeddings yields gains on all tasks. We also find that random embeddings perform comparably to learned embeddings on all supervised vision-language tasks, contrary to conventional wisdom."}

We present a conceptually simple, flexible and general framework using sequence to sequence (seq-to-seq) learning for this task. The framework, called Seq-SG2SL, derives sequence proxies for the two modality and a Transformer-based seq-to-seq model learns to transduce one into the other. A scene graph is decomposed into a sequence of semantic fragments (SF), one for each relationship. A semantic layout is represented as the consequence from a series of brick-action code segments (BACS), dictating the position and scale of each object bounding box in the layout. Viewing the two building blocks, SF and BACS, as corresponding terms in two different vocabularies, a seq-to-seq model is fittingly used to translate. A new metric, semantic layout evaluation understudy (SLEU), is devised to evaluate the task of semantic layout prediction inspired by BLEU. SLEU defines relationships within a layout as unigrams and looks at the spatial distribution for n-grams. Unlike the binary precision of BLEU, SLEU allows for some tolerances spatially through thresholding the Jaccard Index and is consequently more adapted to the task. Experimental results on the challenging Visual Genome dataset show improvement over a non-sequential approach based on graph convolution."}

We incorporate modern probabilistic deep learning methods that we further improve by using the gradients for these estimates. These have two-fold benefits: a) improvement in obtaining the certainty estimates that correlate better with misclassified samples and b) improved attention maps that provide state-of-the-art results in terms of correlation with human attention regions. The improved attention maps result in consistent improvement for various methods for visual question answering. Therefore, the proposed technique can be thought of as a recipe for obtaining improved certainty estimates and explanation for deep learning models. We provide detailed empirical analysis for the visual question answering task on all standard benchmarks and comparison with state of the art methods."}

We use VideoBERT in numerous tasks, including action classification and video captioning. We show that it can be applied directly to open-vocabulary classification, and confirm that large amounts of training data and cross-modal information are critical to performance. Furthermore, we outperform the state-of-the-art on video captioning, and quantitative results verify that the model learns high-level semantic features."}

Many VL approaches treat the language component as an afterthought, using simple language models that are either built upon fixed word embeddings trained on text-only data or are learned from scratch. We conclude that language features deserve more attention, which has been informed by experiments which compare different word embeddings, language models, and embedding augmentation steps on five common VL tasks: image-sentence retrieval, image captioning, visual question answering, phrase grounding, and text-to-clip retrieval. Our experiments provide some striking results; an average embedding language model outperforms a LSTM on retrieval-style tasks; state-of-the-art representations such as BERT perform relatively poorly on vision-language tasks. From this comprehensive set of experiments we can propose a set of best practices for incorporating the language component of vision-language tasks. To further elevate language features, we also show that knowledge in vision-language problems can be transferred across tasks to gain performance with multi-task training. This multi-task training is applied to a new Graph Oriented Vision-Language Embedding (GrOVLE), which we adapt from Word2Vec using WordNet and an original visual-language graph built from Visual Genome, providing a ready-to-use vision-language embedding: http://ai.bu.edu/grovle."}

In this paper, we present an approach which can learn from a small annotated dataset containing a limited range of viewpoints and generalize to detect semantic parts for a much larger range of viewpoints. The approach is based on our matching algorithm, which is used for finding accurate spatial correspondence between two images and transplanting semantic parts annotated on one image to the other. Images in the training set are matched to synthetic images rendered from a 3D CAD model, following which a clustering algorithm is used to automatically annotate semantic parts of the CAD model. During the testing period, this CAD model can synthesize annotated images under every viewpoint. These synthesized images are matched to images in the testing set to detect semantic parts in novel viewpoints. Our algorithm is simple, intuitive, and contains very few parameters. Experiments show our method outperforms standard deep learning approaches and, in particular, performs much better on novel viewpoints.

To this end, we learn an invariant feature from the input video that is shared across all viewpoints of the same scene and a view-dependent feature obtained using the target priors. The proposed approach, View-LSTM, is a recurrent neural network structure that accounts for the temporal consistency and target feature approximation constraints.

Most generative models rely on 2D kernels to generate images and make few assumptions about the 3D world. These models therefore tend to create blurry images or artefacts in tasks that require a strong 3D understanding, such as novel-view synthesis. HoloGAN instead learns a 3D representation of the world, and to render this representation in a realistic manner. Unlike other GANs, HoloGAN provides explicit control over the pose of generated objects through rigid-body transformations of the learnt 3D features. Our experiments show that using explicit 3D features enables HoloGAN to disentangle 3D pose and identity, which is further decomposed into shape and appearance, while still being able to generate images with similar or higher visual quality than other generative models. HoloGAN can be trained end-to-end from unlabelled 2D images only. Particularly, we do not require pose labels, 3D shapes, or multiple views of the same objects. This shows that HoloGAN is the first generative model that learns 3D representations from natural images in an entirely unsupervised manner."}

We observe that each pixel in an image corresponds to a surface in the underlying 3D geometry, where a canonical frame can be identified as represented by three orthogonal axes, one along its normal direction and two in its tangent plane. We propose an algorithm to predict these axes from RGB. Our first insight is that canonical frames computed automatically with recently introduced direction field synthesis methods can provide training data for the task. Our second insight is that networks designed for surface normal prediction provide better results when trained jointly to predict canonical frames, and even better when trained to also predict 2D projections of canonical frames. We conjecture this is because projections of canonical tangent directions often align with local gradients in images, and because those directions are tightly linked to 3Dcanonical frames through projective geometry and orthogonality constraints. In our experiments, we find that our method predicts 3D canonical frames that can be used in applications ranging from surface normal estimation, feature matching, and augmented reality."}

To exploit cross-frame relations, SC-GAN includes a spatial correspondence module which uses Smolyak sparse grids to efficiently match the features across adjacent frames, and an attention mechanism to learn the importance of features in different directions. Furthermore, the generator in SC-GAN learns to estimate depth from the input frames, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between the ground-truth and estimated depth map for the reference frame.

We consider RIO a particularly important task in 3D vision since it enables a wide range of practical applications, including AI-assistants or robots that are asked to find a specific object in a 3D scene. To address this problem, we first introduce 3RScan, a novel dataset and benchmark, which features 1482 RGB-D scans of 478 environments across multiple time steps. Each scene includes several objects whose positions change over time, together with ground truth annotations of object instances and their respective 6DoF mappings among re-scans.

By inverting such renderer, one can think of a learning approach to infer 3D information from 2D images. However, standard graphics renderers involve a fundamental discretization step called rasterization, which prevents the rendering process to be differentiable, hence able to be learned. Unlike the state-of-the-art differentiable renderers, which only approximate the rendering gradient in the back propagation, we propose a truly differentiable rendering framework that is able to (1) directly render colorized mesh using differentiable functions and (2) back-propagate efficient supervision signals to mesh vertices and their attributes from various forms of image representations, including silhouette, shading and color images. The key to our framework is a novel formulation that views rendering as an aggregation function that fuses the probabilistic contributions of all mesh triangles with respect to the rendered pixels. Such formulation enables our framework to flow gradients to the occluded and far-range vertices, which cannot be achieved by the previous state-of-the-arts. We show that by using the proposed renderer, one can achieve significant improvement in 3D unsupervised single-view reconstruction both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Moreover, an evaluation on the Human3.6M benchmark shows that the performance of our method is on par with top performing approaches on the more classic problem of 3D human pose from a third person viewpoint."}

To reduce the ambiguities associated with the reconstruction of invisible areas, our method leverages a dense semantic representation generated from SMPL model as an additional input. One key feature of our network is that it fuses different scales of image features into the 3D space through volumetric feature transformation, which helps to recover accurate surface geometry. The surface details are further refined through a normal refinement network, which can be concatenated with the volume generation network using our proposed volumetric normal projection layer. We also contribute THuman, a 3D real-world human model dataset containing approximately 7000 models. The network is trained using training data generated from the dataset. Overall, due to the specific design of our network and the diversity in our dataset, our method enables 3D human model estimation given only a single image and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches."}

Our two-step framework takes the body pixel-to-surface correspondence map (i.e., IUV map) as proxy representation and then performs estimation of parameterized human pose and shape. Specifically, given an estimated IUV map, we develop a deep neural network optimizing 3D body reconstruction losses and further integrating a render-and-compare scheme to minimize differences between the input and the rendered output, i.e., dense body landmarks, body part masks, and adversarial priors. To boost learning, we further construct a large-scale synthetic dataset (MOCA) utilizing web-crawled Mocap sequences, 3D scans and animations. The generated data covers diversified camera views, human actions and body shapes, and is paired with full ground truth. Our model jointly learns to represent the 3D human body from hybrid datasets, mitigating the problem of unpaired training data. Our experiments show that DenseRaC obtains superior performance against state of the art on public benchmarks of various human-related tasks."}

For example, the limbs may move more flexibly and freely than the torso does. Most of the existing 3D pose estimation methods, despite the very promising results achieved, treat the body joints equally and consequently often lead to larger reconstruction errors on the limbs. In this paper, we propose a progressive approach that explicitly accounts for the distinct DOFs among the body parts. We model parts with higher DOFs like the elbows, as dependent components of the corresponding parts with lower DOFs like the torso, of which the 3D locations can be more reliably estimated. Meanwhile, the high-DOF parts may, in turn, impose a constraint on where the low-DOF ones lie. As a result, parts with different DOFs supervise one another, yielding physically constrained and plausible pose-estimation results. To further facilitate the prediction of the high-DOF parts, we introduce a pose-attribution estimation, where the relative location of a limb joint with respect to the torso, which has the least DOF of a human body, is explicitly estimated and further fed to the joint-estimation module. The proposed approach achieves very promising results, outperforming the state of the art on several benchmarks."}

In this work, we propose a Global-Local Spherical Harmonics (GLoSH) lighting model to improve the lighting component, and jointly predict reflectance and surface normals. The global SH models the holistic lighting while local SH account for the spatial variation of lighting. Also, a novel non-negative lighting constraint is proposed to encourage the estimated SH to be physically meaningful. To seamlessly reflect the GLoSH model, we design a coarse-to-fine network structure. The coarse network predicts global SH, reflectance and normals, and the fine network predicts their local residuals. Lacking labels for reflectance and lighting, we apply synthetic data for model pre-training and fine-tune the model with real data in a self-supervised way. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods only targeting normals or reflectance and shading, our method recovers all components and achieves consistently better results on three real datasets, IIW, SAW and NYUv2."}

While previous works already show that the features of a trained CNN are suitable descriptors, we show here how to extract the feature locations from the network to build a detector. This information is computed from the gradient of the feature map with respect to the input image. This provides a saliency map with local maxima on relevant keypoint locations. Contrary to recent CNN-based detectors, this method requires neither supervised training nor finetuning. We evaluate how repeatable and how 'matchable' the detected keypoints are with the repeatability and matching scores. Matchability is measured with a simple descriptor introduced for the sake of the evaluation. This novel detector reaches similar performances on the standard evaluation HPatches dataset, as well as comparable robustness against illumination and viewpoint changes on Webcam and photo-tourism images. These results show that a CNN trained on a standard task embeds feature location information that is as relevant as when the CNN is specifically trained for feature detection."}

The embedding quality is usually evaluated by the performance in image search tasks. Since very few users bother to open the second page search results, top-k precision mostly dominates the user experience and thus is one of the crucial evaluation metrics for the embedding quality. Despite being extensively studied, existing algorithms are usually based on heuristic observation without theoretical guarantee. Consequently, gradient descent direction on the training loss is mostly inconsistent with the direction of optimizing the concerned evaluation metric. This inconsistency certainly misleads the training direction and degrades the performance. In contrast to existing works, in this paper, we propose a novel deep image embedding algorithm with end-to-end optimization to top-k precision, the evaluation metric that is closely related to user experience. Specially, our loss function is constructed with wisely selected \"misplaced\" images along the top k nearest neighbor decision boundary, so that the gradient descent update directly promotes the concerned metric, top-k precision. Further more, our theoretical analysis on the upper bounding and consistency properties of the proposed loss supports that minimizing our proposed loss is equivalent to maximizing top-k precision. Experiments show that our proposed algorithm outperforms all compared state-of-the-art deep image embedding algorithms on three benchmark datasets."}

There exist unknown target samples out of the knowledge of source domain. Compared to the close set setting, how to separate the unknown (unshared) class from the known (shared) ones plays the key role. Whereas, previous methods did not emphasize the semantic structure of the open set data, which may introduce bias into the domain alignment and confuse the classifier around the decision boundary. In this paper, we exploit the semantic structure of open set data from two aspects: 1) Semantic Categorical Alignment, which aims to achieve good separability of target known classes by categorically aligning the centroid of target with the source. 2) Semantic Contrastive Mapping, which aims to push the unknown class away from the decision boundary. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method performs favourably against the state-of-the-art methods on representative benchmarks, e.g. Digits and Office-31 datasets."}

However, variability in images is not just due to different depicted object classes, but also depends on other latent characteristics such as viewpoint or illumination. In addition to these structured properties, random noise further obstructs the visual relations of interest. The common approach to metric learning is to enforce a representation that is invariant under all factors but the ones of interest. In contrast, we propose to explicitly learn the latent characteristics that are shared by and go across object classes. We can then directly explain away structured visual variability, rather than assuming it to be unknown random noise. We propose a novel surrogate task to learn visual characteristics shared across classes with a separate encoder. This encoder is trained jointly with the encoder for class information by reducing their mutual information. On five standard image retrieval benchmarks the approach significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art.

This is obtained by adaptively dividing the videos into small segments and comparing two consecutive segments. This allows using pre-trained models on still images for video classification while successfully capturing the spatiotemporal variations in the videos. The adaptive segment selection enables effective encoding of the essential discriminative information of untrimmed videos. Based on Gaussian Scale Mixture, we compute the weights by extracting the mutual information between two consecutive segments. Unlike pooling-based methods, our AWSD gives more importance to the frames that characterize actions or events thanks to its adaptive segment length selection. We conducted extensive experimental analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method and compared our results against those of recent state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datatsets, including UCF101, HMDB51, ActivityNet v1.3, and Maryland. The obtained results on these benchmark datatsets showed that our method significantly outperforms earlier works and sets the new state-of-the-art performance in video classification.

Adversarial sample generation methods range from simple to complex optimization techniques. Majority of these methods generate adversaries through optimization objectives that are tied to the pre-softmax or softmax output of the network. In this work we, (i) show the drawbacks of such attacks, (ii) propose two new evaluation metrics: Old Label New Rank (OLNR) and New Label Old Rank (NLOR) in order to quantify the extent of damage made by an attack, and (iii) propose a new attack FDA: Feature Disruptive attack, to address the drawbacks of existing attacks. FDA works by generating image perturbation that disrupts features at each layer of the network and causes deep-features to be highly corrupt. This allows FDA adversaries to severely reduce the performance of deep networks. We experimentally validate that FDA generates stronger adversaries than other state-of-the-art methods for Image classification, even in the presence of various defense measures. More importantly, we show that FDA disrupts feature-representation based tasks even without access to the task-specific network or methodology."}

A shared common ground among systems which successfully achieve this feat is the integration of previously encountered observations into the current state being estimated. This necessitates the use of a memory module for incorporating previously visited states whilst simultaneously offering an internal representation of the observed environment. In this work we develop a memory module which contains rigidly aligned point-embeddings that represent a coherent scene structure acquired from an RGB-D sequence of observations. The point-embeddings are extracted using modern convolutional neural network architectures, and alignment is performed by computing a dense correspondence matrix between a new observation and the current embeddings residing in the memory module. The whole framework is end-to-end trainable, resulting in a recurrent joint optimisation of the point-embeddings contained in the memory. This process amplifies the shared information across states, providing increased robustness and accuracy. We show significant improvement of our method across a set of experiments performed on the synthetic VIZDoom environment and a real world Active Vision Dataset."}

[??], has been considered as a principle to reveal visual structures under various transformations. It contains the celebrated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a special case that only equivary to the translations. In contrast, we seek to train TERs for a generic class of transformations and train them in an   unsupervised  fashion. To this end, we present a novel principled method by Autoencoding Variational Transformations (AVT), compared with the conventional approach to autoencoding data. Formally, given transformed images, the AVT seeks to train the networks by maximizing the mutual information between the transformations and representations. This ensures the resultant TERs of individual images contain the   intrinsic  information about their visual structures that would equivary   extricably  under various transformations in a generalized   nonlinear  case. Technically, we show that the resultant optimization problem can be efficiently solved by maximizing a variational lower-bound of the mutual information. This variational approach introduces a transformation decoder to approximate the intractable posterior of transformations, resulting in an autoencoding architecture with a pair of the representation encoder and the transformation decoder. Experiments demonstrate the proposed AVT model sets a new record for the performances on unsupervised tasks, greatly closing the performance gap to the supervised models."}

Though multi-mode prior or multi-generator models have been proposed to alleviate this problem, such approaches may fail depending on the empirically chosen initial mode components. In contrast to such bottom-up approaches, we present GAN-Tree, which follows a hierarchical divisive strategy to address such discontinuous multi-modal data. Devoid of any assumption on the number of modes, GAN-Tree utilizes a novel mode-splitting algorithm to effectively split the parent mode to semantically cohesive children modes, facilitating unsupervised clustering. Further, it also enables incremental addition of new data modes to an already trained GAN-Tree, by updating only a single branch of the tree structure. As compared to prior approaches, the proposed framework offers a higher degree of flexibility in choosing a large variety of mutually exclusive and exhaustive tree nodes called GAN-Set. Extensive experiments on synthetic and natural image datasets including ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of GAN-Tree against the prior state-of-the-art."}

In this paper, we propose a novel objective for one-class learning. Our key idea is to use a pair of orthonormal frames -- as subspaces -- to \"sandwich\" the labeled data via optimizing for two objectives jointly: i) minimize the distance between the origins of the two subspaces, and ii) to maximize the margin between the hyperplanes and the data, either subspace demanding the data to be in its positive and negative orthant respectively. Our proposed objective however leads to a non-convex optimization problem, to which we resort to Riemannian optimization schemes and derive an efficient conjugate gradient scheme on the Stiefel manifold. To study the effectiveness of our scheme, we propose a new dataset Dash-Cam-Pose, consisting of clips with skeleton poses of humans seated in a car, the task being to classify the clips as normal or abnormal; the latter is when any human pose is out-of-position with regard to say an airbag deployment. Our experiments on the proposed Dash-Cam-Pose dataset, as well as several other standard anomaly/novelty detection benchmarks demonstrate the benefits of our scheme, achieving state-of-the-art one-class accuracy."}

Though considerable progress has been made, there still exist challenges for objects with small size, arbitrary direction, and dense distribution. Apart from natural images, such issues are especially pronounced for aerial images of great importance. This paper presents a novel multi-category rotation detector for small, cluttered and rotated objects, namely SCRDet. Specifically, a sampling fusion network is devised which fuses multi-layer feature with effective anchor sampling, to improve the sensitivity to small objects. Meanwhile, the supervised pixel attention network and the channel attention network are jointly explored for small and cluttered object detection by suppressing the noise and highlighting the objects feature. For more accurate rotation estimation, the IoU constant factor is added to the smooth L1 loss to address the boundary problem for the rotating bounding box.

Predominant works integrate region proposal mechanisms with convolutional neural networks (CNN). Although CNN is proficient in extracting discriminative local features, grand challenges still exist to measure the likelihood of a bounding box containing a complete object (i.e., \"objectness\"). In this paper, we propose a novel WSOD framework with Objectness Distillation (i.e., WSOD2) by designing a tailored training mechanism for weakly-supervised object detection. Multiple regression targets are specifically determined by jointly considering bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) objectness from low-level measurement and CNN confidences with an adaptive linear combination. As bounding box regression can facilitate a region proposal learning to approach its regression target with high objectness during training, deep objectness representation learned from bottom-up evidences can be gradually distilled into CNN by optimization. We explore different adaptive training curves for BU/TD objectness, and show that the proposed WSOD2 can achieve state-of-the-art results."}

Inspired by great progress of deep learning, deep re-ID models began to be popular and gained state-of-the-art performance. However, recent works found that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing potential threats to DNNs based applications. This phenomenon throws a serious question about whether deep re-ID based systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we take the first attempt to implement robust physical-world attacks against deep re-ID. We propose a novel attack algorithm, called advPattern, for generating adversarial patterns on clothes, which learns the variations of image pairs across cameras to pull closer the image features from the same camera, while pushing features from different cameras farther. By wearing our crafted \"invisible cloak\", an adversary can evade person search, or impersonate a target person to fool deep re-ID models in physical world. We evaluate the effectiveness of our transformable patterns on adversaries' clothes with Market1501 and our established PRCS dataset. The experimental results show that the rank-1 accuracy of re-ID models for matching the adversary decreases from 87.9% to 27.1% under Evading Attack. Furthermore, the adversary can impersonate a target person with 47.1% rank-1 accuracy and 67.9% mAP under Impersonation Attack.

We advocate the complementary powers of attention and diversity for Re-ID, by proposing an Attentive but Diverse Network (ABD-Net). ABD-Net seamlessly integrates attention modules and diversity regularizations throughout the entire network to learn features that are representative, robust, and more discriminative. Specifically, we introduce a pair of complementary attention modules, focusing on channel aggregation and position awareness, respectively. Then, we plug in a novel orthogonality constraint that efficiently enforces diversity on both hidden activations and weights. Through an extensive set of ablation study, we verify that the attentive and diverse terms each contributes to the performance boosts of ABD-Net.

However, the collected images and labeled count values are limited in reality, which means only a small closed set is observed. Existing methods typically model this task in a regression manner, while they are likely to suffer from an unseen scene with counts out of the scope of the closed set. In fact, counting is decomposable. A dense region can always be divided until the count values of sub-regions are within the previously observed closed set. Inspired by this idea, we propose a simple but effective approach, Spatial Divide-and-Conquer Network (S-DCNet). S-DCNet learns to classify closed-set counts and can generalize to open-set counts via S-DC. S-DCNet is also efficient. To avoid repeatedly computing sub-region convolutional features, S-DC is executed on the feature map instead of on the input image. S-DCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three crowd counting datasets (ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50 and UCF-QNRF), a vehicle counting dataset (TRANCOS) and a plant counting dataset (MTC).

However, directly calculating the distances between the query image and support image in existing methods may cause ambiguity because dominant objects can locate anywhere on images. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Semantic Alignment Metric Learning (SAML) method for few-shot learning that aligns the semantically relevant dominant objects through a \"collect-and-select\" strategy. Specifically, we first calculate a relation matrix (RM) to \"collect\" the distances of each local region pairs of the 3D tensor extracted from a query image and the mean tensor of the support images. Then, the attention technique is adapted to \"select\" the semantically relevant pairs and put more weights on them. Afterwards, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is utilized to map the reweighted RMs to their corresponding similarity scores. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the generalization ability of SAML and gives a theoretical guarantee. Empirical results demonstrate that semantic alignment is achieved. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the strengths of the proposed approach and demonstrate that SAML significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

Current video object segmentation methods are frame-based and often require optical flow to capture temporal consistency across frames which can be difficult to compute. To this end, we propose a video based capsule network, CapsuleVOS, which can segment several frames at once conditioned on a reference frame and segmentation mask. This conditioning is performed through a novel routing algorithm for attention-based efficient capsule selection. We address two challenging issues in video object segmentation: 1) segmentation of small objects and 2) occlusion of objects across time. The issue of segmenting small objects is addressed with a zooming module which allows the network to process small spatial regions of the video. Apart from this, the framework utilizes a novel memory module based on recurrent networks which helps in tracking objects when they move out of frame or are occluded. The network is trained end-to-end and we demonstrate its effectiveness on two benchmark video object segmentation datasets; it outperforms current offline approaches on the Youtube-VOS dataset while having a run-time that is almost twice as fast as competing methods.

The unsupervised BAE-NET is trained with a collection of un-segmented shapes, using a shape reconstruction loss, without any ground-truth labels. Specifically, the network takes an input shape and encodes it using a convolutional neural network, whereas the decoder concatenates the resulting feature code with a point coordinate and outputs a value indicating whether the point is inside/outside the shape. Importantly, the decoder is branched: each branch learns a compact representation for one commonly recurring part of the shape collection, e.g., airplane wings. By complementing the shape reconstruction loss with a label loss, BAE-NET is easily tuned for one-shot learning. We show unsupervised, weakly supervised, and one-shot learning results by BAE-NET, demonstrating that using only a couple of exemplars, our network can generally outperform state-of-the-art supervised methods trained on hundreds of segmented shapes.

Our approach results in a good volumetric representation that effectively tackles noisy point cloud datasets and is more robust for learning. Moreover, we further introduce group equivariant CNN to 3D, by defining the convolution operator on a symmetry group acting on  Z ^3 and its isomorphic sets. This improves the expressive capacity without increasing parameters, leading to more robust segmentation results.We highlight the performance on standard benchmarks and show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms on the ShapeNet and S3DIS datasets."}

This usually needs \"opposite\" strategies to suppress the two terms, and has not been well resolved in the literature. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial learning framework to improve this situation. Departing from the tradition of jointly reducing MD and FA via a single objective, we decompose this difficult task into two sub-tasks handled by two models trained adversarially, with each focusing on reducing either MD or FA. Such a new design brings forth at least three advantages. First, as each model focuses on a relatively simpler sub-task, the overall difficulty of ISOS is somehow decreased. Second, the adversarial training of the two models naturally produces a delicate balance of MD and FA, and low rates for both MD and FA could be achieved at Nash equilibrium. Third, this MD-FA detachment gives us more flexibility to develop specific models dedicated to each sub-task. To realize the above design, we propose a conditional Generative Adversarial Network comprising of two generators and one discriminator. Each generator strives for one sub-task, while the discriminator differentiates the three segmentation results from the two generators and the ground truth. Moreover, in order to better serve the sub-tasks, the two generators, based on context aggregation networks, utilzse different size of receptive fields, providing both local and global views of objects for segmentation. As verified on multiple infrared image data sets, our method consistently achieves better segmentation than many state-of-the-art ISOS methods."}

Using this data, we study the differences in human attention during free-viewing and image captioning tasks. We look into the relationship between human atten- tion and language constructs during perception and sen- tence articulation. We also analyse attention deployment mechanisms in the top-down soft attention approach that is argued to mimic human attention in captioning tasks, and investigate whether visual saliency can help image caption- ing. Our study reveals that (1) human attention behaviour differs in free-viewing and image description tasks. Hu- mans tend to fixate on a greater variety of regions under the latter task, (2) there is a strong relationship between de- scribed objects and attended objects (97% of the described objects are being attended), (3) a convolutional neural net- work as feature encoder accounts for human-attended re- gions during image captioning to a great extent (around 78%), (4) soft-attention mechanism differs from human at- tention, both spatially and temporally, and there is low correlation between caption scores and attention consis- tency scores. These indicate a large gap between humans and machines in regards to top-down attention, and (5) by integrating the soft attention model with image saliency, we can significantly improve the model's performance on Flickr30k and MSCOCO benchmarks.

To this end we introduce a novel neural architecture, called OperatorNet, which takes as input a set of linear operators representing a shape and produces its 3D embedding. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms previous purely geometric methods for the same problem. Furthermore, we introduce a novel functional operator, which encodes the extrinsic or pose-dependent shape information, and thus complements purely intrinsic pose-oblivious operators, such as the classical Laplacian. Coupled with this novel operator, our reconstruction network achieves very high reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of incomplete information about a shape, given a soft or functional map expressed in a reduced basis. Finally, we demonstrate that the multiplicative functional algebra enjoyed by these operators can be used to synthesize entirely new unseen shapes, in the context of shape interpolation and shape analogy applications."}

To transfer information between the geometric and semantic branches of the network, we introduce paths between them concatenating features at corresponding network layers. Motivated by the limited amount of training samples from real scenes, an interesting attribute of our architecture is the capacity to supplement the existing dataset by generating a new training dataset with high quality, realistic scenes that even includes occlusion and real noise. We build the new dataset by sampling the features directly from latent space which generates a pair of partial volumetric surface and completed volumetric semantic surface. Moreover, we utilize multiple discriminators to increase the accuracy and realism of the reconstructions. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on standard benchmarks for the two most common completion tasks: semantic 3D scene completion and 3D object completion."}

However, there still exist great challenges when directly applying this technology in indoor environments, e.g., large areas of non-texture regions like white wall, more complex ego-motion of handheld camera, transparent glasses and shiny objects. To overcome these problems, we propose a new optical-flow based training paradigm which reduces the difficulty of unsupervised learning by providing a clearer training target and handles the non-texture regions. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the result of our method is comparable to fully supervised methods on the NYU Depth V2 benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative result of purely unsupervised learning method reported on indoor datasets."}

The intuition behind is to leverage the coupled nature of these two tasks to improve the granularity and performance of scene understanding. We propose to exploit two critical and essential connections between these two tasks: (i) human-object interaction (HOI) to model the fine-grained relations between agents and objects in the scene, and (ii) physical commonsense to model the physical plausibility of the reconstructed scene. The optimal configuration of the 3D scene, represented by a parse graph, is inferred using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which efficiently traverses through the non-differentiable joint solution space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the performance of the two tasks on three datasets, showing an improved generalization ability."}

However, a standard large-scale dataset does not exist, in which different types of modalities across vision and sensors are integrated. To address the disadvantage of vision-based modalities and push towards multi/cross modal action understanding, this paper introduces a new large-scale dataset recorded from 20 distinct subjects with seven different types of modalities: RGB videos, keypoints, acceleration, gyroscope, orientation, Wi-Fi and pressure signal. The dataset consists of more than 36k video clips for 37 action classes covering a wide range of daily life activities such as desktop-related and check-in-based ones in four different distinct scenarios. On the basis of our dataset, we propose a novel multi modality distillation model with attention mechanism to realize an adaptive knowledge transfer from sensor-based modalities to vision-based modalities. The proposed model significantly improves performance of action recognition compared to models trained with only RGB information. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our model on cross-subject, -view, -scene and -session evaluation criteria. We believe that this new large-scale multimodal dataset will contribute the community of multimodal based action understanding."}

We refer to it as HACS (Human Action Clips and Segments). We leverage consensus and disagreement among visual classifiers to automatically mine candidate short clips from unlabeled videos, which are subsequently validated by human annotators. The resulting dataset is dubbed HACS Clips. Through a separate process we also collect annotations defining action segment boundaries. This resulting dataset is called HACS Segments. Overall, HACS Clips consists of 1.5M annotated clips sampled from 504K untrimmed videos, and HACS Segments contains 139K action segments densely annotated in 50K untrimmed videos spanning 200 action categories. HACS Clips contains more labeled examples than any existing video benchmark. This renders our dataset both a large-scale action recognition benchmark and an excellent source for spatiotemporal feature learning. In our transfer learning experiments on three target datasets, HACS Clips outperforms Kinetics-600, Moments-In-Time and Sports1M as a pretraining source. On HACS Segments, we evaluate state-of-the-art methods of action proposal generation and action localization, and highlight the new challenges posed by our dense temporal annotations."}

Most existing methods require laborious frame-level supervision to train action localization models. In this work, we propose a framework, called 3C-Net, which only requires video-level supervision (weak supervision) in the form of action category labels and the corresponding count. We introduce a novel formulation to learn discriminative action features with enhanced localization capabilities. Our joint formulation has three terms: a classification term to ensure the separability of learned action features, an adapted multi-label center loss term to enhance the action feature discriminability and a counting loss term to delineate adjacent action sequences, leading to improved localization. Comprehensive experiments are performed on two challenging benchmarks: THUMOS14 and ActivityNet 1.2. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art for weakly-supervised temporal action localization on both datasets. On the THUMOS14 dataset, the proposed method achieves an absolute gain of 4.6% in terms of mean average precision (mAP), compared to the state-of-the-art.

By contrast, inference in a deep network, requiring a single forward pass, is much faster. Taking advantage of this, we propose a novel architecture to fit a 3D garment template to a 3D body. Specifically, we build upon the recent progress in 3D point cloud processing with deep networks to extract garment features at varying levels of detail, including point-wise, patch-wise and global features. We fuse these features with those extracted in parallel from the 3D body, so as to model the cloth-body interactions. The resulting two-stream architecture, which we call as GarNet, is trained using a loss function inspired by physics-based modeling, and delivers visually plausible garment shapes whose 3D points are, on average, less than 1 cm away from those of a PBS method, while running 100 times faster. Moreover, the proposed method can model various garment types with different cutting patterns when parameters of those patterns are given as input to the network."}

A reoccurring challenge is how to enable a model to generate a rich variety of samples from the entire target distribution, rather than only from a distribution confined to the training data. In other words, we would like the generative model to go beyond the observed samples and learn to generate \"unseen\", yet still plausible, data. In our work, we present CompoNet, a generative neural network for 2D or 3D shapes that is based on a part-based prior, where the key idea is for the network to synthesize shapes by varying both the shape parts and their compositions. Treating a shape not as an unstructured whole, but as a (re-)composable set of deformable parts, adds a combinatorial dimension to the generative process to enrich the diversity of the output, encouraging the generator to venture more into the \"unseen\". We show that our part-based model generates richer variety of plausible shapes compared with baseline generative models. To this end, we introduce two quantitative metrics to evaluate the diversity of a generative model and assess how well the generated data covers both the training data and unseen data from the same target distribution."}

The DDSL is a differentiable layer compatible with deep neural networks for bridging simplex mesh-based geometry representations (point clouds, line mesh, triangular mesh, tetrahedral mesh) with raster images (e.g., 2D/3D grids). The DDSL uses Non-Uniform Fourier Transform (NUFT) to perform differentiable, efficient, anti- aliased rasterization of simplex-based signals. We present a complete theoretical framework for the process as well as an efficient backpropagation algorithm. Compared to previous differentiable renderers and rasterizers, the DDSL generalizes to arbitrary simplex degrees and dimensions. In particular, we explore its applications to 2D shapes and illustrate two applications of this method: (1) mesh editing and optimization guided by neural network outputs, and (2) using DDSL for a differentiable rasterization loss to facilitate end-to-end training of polygon generators. We are able to validate the effectiveness of gradient-based shape optimization with the example of airfoil optimization, and using the differentiable rasterization loss to facilitate end-to-end training, we surpass state of the art for polygonal image segmentation given ground-truth bounding boxes."}

However, most existing FCNs-based methods still suffer from coarse object boundaries. In this paper, to solve this problem, we focus on the complementarity between salient edge information and salient object information. Accordingly, we present an edge guidance network (EGNet) for salient object detection with three steps to simultaneously model these two kinds of complementary information in a single network. In the first step, we extract the salient object features by a progressive fusion way. In the second step, we integrate the local edge information and global location information to obtain the salient edge features. Finally, to sufficiently leverage these complementary features, we couple the same salient edge features with salient object features at various resolutions. Benefiting from the rich edge information and location information in salient edge features, the fused features can help locate salient objects, especially their boundaries more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on six widely used datasets without any pre-processing and post-processing.

We have used Free-Viewing and Visual Search task instructions and 7 feature contrasts for each feature category. Our study reveals that state-of-the-art Deep Learning saliency models do not perform well with synthetic pattern images, instead, models with Spectral/Fourier inspiration outperform others in saliency metrics and are more consistent with human psychophysical experimentation. This study proposes a new way to evaluate saliency models in the forthcoming literature, accounting for synthetic images with uniquely low-level feature contexts, distinct from previous eye tracking image datasets."}

DeblurGAN-V2 is based on a relativistic conditional GAN with a double-scale discriminator. For the first time, we introduce the Feature Pyramid Network into deblurring, as a core building block in the generator of DeblurGAN-V2. It can flexibly work with a wide range of backbones, to navigate the balance between performance and efficiency. The plug-in of sophisticated backbones (e.g. Inception ResNet v2) can lead to solid state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, with light-weight backbones (e.g. MobileNet and its variants), DeblurGAN-V2 becomes 10-100 times faster than the nearest competitors, while maintaining close to state-of-the-art results, implying the option of real-time video deblurring. We demonstrate that DeblurGAN-V2 has very competitive performance on several popular benchmarks, in terms of deblurring quality (both objective and subjective), as well as efficiency.

However, much of the research has been limited to approaches that either do not take audio corresponding to video into account at all, or those that model the audio-visual correlations in service of sound or sound source localization. In this paper, we present the evidence, that audio signals can carry surprising amount of information when it comes to high-level visual-lingual tasks. Specifically, we focus on the problem of weakly-supervised dense event captioning in videos and show that audio on its own can nearly rival performance of a state-of-the-art visual model and, combined with video, can improve on the state-of-the-art performance.

We first build a large scale, carefully controlled dataset of human utterances each of which refers to a 2D rendering of a 3D CAD model so as to distinguish it from a set of shape-wise similar alternatives. Using this dataset, we develop neural language understanding (listening) and production (speaking) models that vary in their grounding (pure 3D forms via point-clouds vs. rendered 2D images), the degree of pragmatic reasoning captured (e.g. speakers that reason about a listener or not), and the neural architecture (e.g. with or without attention). We find models that perform well with both synthetic and human partners, and with held out utterances and objects. We also find that these models are capable of zero-shot transfer learning to novel object classes (e.g. transfer from training on chairs to testing on lamps), as well as to real-world images drawn from furniture catalogs. Lesion studies indicate that the neural listeners depend heavily on part-related words and associate these words correctly with visual parts of objects (without any explicit supervision on such parts), and that transfer to novel classes is most successful when known part-related words are available. This work illustrates a practical approach to language grounding, and provides a novel case study in the relationship between object shape and linguistic structure when it comes to object differentiation."}

To encourage the development of image captioning models that can learn visual concepts from alternative data sources, such as object detection datasets, we present the first large-scale benchmark for this task. Dubbed 'nocaps', for novel object captioning at scale, our benchmark consists of 166,100 human-generated captions describing 15,100 images from the Open Images validation and test sets. The associated training data consists of COCO image-caption pairs, plus Open Images image-level labels and object bounding boxes. Since Open Images contains many more classes than COCO, nearly 400 object classes seen in test images have no or very few associated training captions (hence, nocaps). We extend existing novel object captioning models to establish strong baselines for this benchmark and provide analysis to guide future work."}

We introduce randomized layer normalization, a novel powerful regularizer, and we account for object motion relative to the scene. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to learn the camera intrinsic parameters, including lens distortion, from video in an unsupervised manner, thereby allowing us to extract accurate depth and motion from arbitrary videos of unknown origin at scale.

To address this issue, we introduce a new large-scale text reading benchmark dataset named Chinese Street View Text (C-SVT) with 430,000 street view images, which is at least 14 times as large as the existing Chinese text reading benchmarks. To recognize Chinese text in the wild while keeping large-scale datasets labeling cost-effective, we propose to annotate one part of the C-SVT dataset (30,000 images) in locations and text labels as full annotations and add 400,000 more images, where only the corresponding text-of-interest in the regions is given as weak annotations. To exploit the rich information from the weakly annotated data, we design a text reading network in a partially supervised learning framework, which enables to localize and recognize text, learn from fully and weakly annotated data simultaneously. To localize the best matched text proposals from weakly labeled images, we propose an online proposal matching module incorporated in the whole model, spotting the keyword regions by sharing parameters for end-to-end training. Compared with fully supervised training algorithms, this model can improve the end-to-end recognition performance remarkably by 4.03% in F-score at the same labeling cost. The proposed model can also achieve state-of-the-art results on the ICDAR 2017-RCTW dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed partially supervised learning framework."}

Moreover, we obtain this result after training on only one GPU. We accomplish this by breaking instance segmentation into two parallel subtasks: (1) generating a set of prototype masks and (2) predicting per-instance mask coefficients. Then we produce instance masks by linearly combining the prototypes with the mask coefficients. We find that because this process doesn't depend on repooling, this approach produces very high-quality masks and exhibits temporal stability for free.

Few-shot segmentation has thus been developed to learn to perform segmentation from only a few annotated examples. In this paper, we tackle the challenging few-shot segmentation problem from a metric learning perspective and present PANet, a novel prototype alignment network to better utilize the information of the support set. Our PANet learns class-specific prototype representations from a few support images within an embedding space and then performs segmentation over the query images through matching each pixel to the learned prototypes. With non-parametric metric learning, PANet offers high-quality prototypes that are representative for each semantic class and meanwhile discriminative for different classes. Moreover, PANet introduces a prototype alignment regularization between support and query. With this, PANet fully exploits knowledge from the support and provides better generalization on few-shot segmentation. Significantly, our model achieves the mIoU score of 48.1% and 55.7% on PASCAL-5i for 1-shot and 5-shot settings respectively, surpassing the state-of-the-art method by 1.8% and 8.6%."}

Most existing methods rely on precise mask annotations of every category. However, it is difficult and costly to segment objects in novel categories because a large number of mask annotations is required. We introduce ShapeMask, which learns the intermediate concept of object shape to address the problem of generalization in instance segmentation to novel categories. ShapeMask starts with a bounding box detection and gradually refines it by first estimating the shape of the detected object through a collection of shape priors. Next, ShapeMask refines the coarse shape into an instance level mask by learning instance embeddings. The shape priors provide a strong cue for object-like prediction, and the instance embeddings model the instance specific appearance information. ShapeMask significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by 6.4 and 3.8 AP when learning across categories, and obtains competitive performance in the fully supervised setting. It is also robust to inaccurate detections, decreased model capacity, and small training data. Moreover, it runs efficiently with 150ms inference time on a GPU and trains within 11 hours on TPUs. With a larger backbone model, ShapeMask increases the gap with state-of-the-art to 9.4 and 6.2 AP across categories.

We propose two ways to construct spatiotemporal neighborhoods for each point in the point cloud sequence. Information from these neighborhoods is aggregated to learn features per point. We benchmark our network on a variety of 3D recognition tasks including action recognition, semantic segmentation and scene flow estimation. MeteorNet shows stronger performance than previous grid-based methods while achieving state-of-the-art performance on Synthia. MeteorNet also outperforms previous baseline methods that are able to process at most two consecutive point clouds.

Their success benefited from a massive boost when very deep CNN models were able to be reliably trained. Despite their merits, CNNs fail to properly address problems with non-Euclidean data. To overcome this challenge, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) build graphs to represent non-Euclidean data, borrow concepts from CNNs, and apply them in training. GCNs show promising results, but they are usually limited to very shallow models due to the vanishing gradient problem. As a result, most state-of-the-art GCN models are no deeper than 3 or 4 layers. In this work, we present new ways to successfully train very deep GCNs. We do this by borrowing concepts from CNNs, specifically residual/dense connections and dilated convolutions, and adapting them to GCN architectures. Extensive experiments show the positive effect of these deep GCN frameworks. Finally, we use these new concepts to build a very deep 56-layer GCN, and show how it significantly boosts performance (+3.7% mIoU over state-of-the-art) in the task of point cloud semantic segmentation.

Generally, the combination of expensive LiDAR sensors and stereo RGB imaging has been paramount for successful 3D object detection algorithms, whereas monocular image-only methods experience drastically reduced performance. We propose to reduce the gap by reformulating the monocular 3D detection problem as a standalone 3D region proposal network. We leverage the geometric relationship of 2D and 3D perspectives, allowing 3D boxes to utilize well-known and powerful convolutional features generated in the image-space. To help address the strenuous 3D parameter estimations, we further design depth-aware convolutional layers which enable location specific feature development and in consequence improved 3D scene understanding. Compared to prior work in monocular 3D detection, our method consists of only the proposed 3D region proposal network rather than relying on external networks, data, or multiple stages. M3D-RPN is able to significantly improve the performance of both monocular 3D Object Detection and Bird's Eye View tasks within the KITTI urban autonomous driving dataset, while efficiently using a shared multi-class model."}

We annotated all sequences of the KITTI Vision Odometry Benchmark and provide dense point-wise annotations for the complete 360-degree field-of-view of the employed automotive LiDAR.

While a variety of CNN architectures and loss functions have been devised recently, we still have a limited understanding of how to train the CNN models with the label noise inherent in existing face recognition datasets. To address this issue, this paper develops a novel co-mining strategy to effectively train on the datasets with noisy labels. Specifically, we simultaneously use the loss values as the cue to detect noisy labels, exchange the high-confidence clean faces to alleviate the errors accumulated issue caused by the sample-selection bias, and re-weight the predicted clean faces to make them dominate the discriminative model training in a mini-batch fashion. Extensive experiments by training on three popular datasets (i.e., CASIA-WebFace, MS-Celeb-1M and VggFace2) and testing on several benchmarks, including LFW, AgeDB, CFP, CALFW, CPLFW, RFW, and MegaFace, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our new approach over the state-of-the-art alternatives."}

However, the aging process of each individual is more dominated by his/her personalized factors, including the invariant factors such as identity and mole, as well as the personalized aging patterns, e.g., one may age by graying hair while another may age by receding hairline. Following this biological principle, in this work, we propose an effective and efficient method to simulate natural aging. Specifically, a personalized aging basis is established for each individual to depict his/her own aging factors. Then different ages share this basis, being derived through age-specific transforms. The age-specific transforms represent the aging trends which are shared among all individuals. The proposed method can achieve continuous face aging with favorable aging accuracy, identity preservation, and fidelity. Furthermore, befitted from the effective design, a unique model is capable of all ages and the prediction time is significantly saved."}

Our model manages to preserve all other visual attributes of a real face, such as head orientation, even though this and other attributes are not labeled in either real or synthetic domain. Since our model learns to manipulate a specific property in isolation using only \"synthetic demonstrations\" of such manipulations without explicitly provided labels, it can be applied to shape, texture, lighting, and other properties that are difficult to measure or represent as real-valued vectors. We measure the degree to which our model preserves other attributes of a real image when a single specific attribute is manipulated. We use digit datasets to analyze how discrepancy in attribute distributions affects the performance of our model, and demonstrate results in a far more difficult setting: learning to manipulate real human faces using nonphotorealistic 3D renders."}

TRB not only preserves the flexibility of skeleton keypoint representation, but also contains rich pose and human shape information. Therefore, it promises broader application areas, such as human shape editing and conditional image generation. We further introduce the challenging problem of TRB estimation, where joint learning of human pose and shape is required. We construct several large-scale TRB estimation datasets, based on the popular 2D pose datasets LSP, MPII and COCO. To effectively solve TRB estimation, we propose a two-branch network (TRB-net) with three novel techniques, namely X-structure (Xs), Directional Convolution (DC) and Pairwise mapping (PM), to enforce multi-level message passing for joint feature learning. We evaluate our proposed TRB-net and several leading approaches on our proposed TRB datasets, and demonstrate the superiority of our method through extensive evaluations."}

To reduce the dependence on expensive bounding box annotations, we propose a new semi-supervised object detection formulation, in which a few seed box level annotations and a large scale of image level annotations are used to train the detector. We adopt a training-mining framework, which is widely used in weakly supervised object detection tasks. However, the mining process inherently introduces various kinds of labelling noises: false negatives, false positives and inaccurate boundaries, which can be harmful for training the standard object detectors (e.g. Faster RCNN). We propose a novel NOise Tolerant Ensemble RCNN (NOTE-RCNN) object detector to handle such noisy labels. Comparing to standard Faster RCNN, it contains three highlights: an ensemble of two classification heads and a distillation head to avoid overfitting on noisy labels and improve the mining precision, masking the negative sample loss in box predictor to avoid the harm of false negative labels, and training box regression head only on seed annotations to eliminate the harm from inaccurate boundaries of mined bounding boxes. We evaluate the methods on ILSVRC 2013 and MSCOCO 2017 dataset; we observe that the detection accuracy consistently improves as we iterate between mining and training steps, and state-of-the-art performance is achieved."}

We observe that if backgrounds in the training and testing datasets are very different, it dramatically introduces difficulties to extract robust pedestrian features, and thus compromises the cross-domain person re-ID performance. In this paper, we formulate such problems as a background shift problem. A Suppression of Background Shift Generative Adversarial Network (SBSGAN) is proposed to generate images with suppressed backgrounds. Unlike simply removing backgrounds using binary masks, SBSGAN allows the generator to decide whether pixels should be preserved or suppressed to reduce segmentation errors caused by noisy foreground masks. Additionally, we take ID-related cues, such as vehicles and companions into consideration. With high-quality generated images, a Densely Associated 2-Stream (DA-2S) network is introduced with Inter Stream Densely Connection (ISDC) modules to strengthen the complementarity of the generated data and ID-related cues.

To effectively learn the scale, we average the spatial features and distill the scale from channels. For fast-deployment, we propose a scale decomposition method that transfers the robust fractional scale into combinations of fixed integral scales for each convolution filter, which exploit the dilated convolution.

One way to alleviate this issue is to enhance the features of small RoIs using a super-resolution (SR) technique. We investigate how to improve feature-level super-resolution especially for small object detection, and discover its performance can be significantly improved by (i) utilizing proper high-resolution target features as supervision signals for training of a SR model and (ii) matching the relative receptive fields of training pairs of input low-resolution features and target high-resolution features. We propose a novel feature-level super-resolution approach that not only correctly addresses these two desiderata but also is integrable with any proposal-based detectors with feature pooling. In our experiments, our approach significantly improves the performance of Faster R-CNN on three benchmarks of Tsinghua-Tencent 100K, PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. The improvement for small objects is remarkably large, and encouragingly, those for medium and large objects are nontrivial too.

Instead of processing an entire image pyramid, AutoFocus adopts a coarse to fine approach and only processes regions which are likely to contain small objects at finer scales. This is achieved by predicting category agnostic segmentation maps for small objects at coarser scales, called FocusPixels. FocusPixels can be predicted with high recall, and in many cases, they only cover a small fraction of the entire image. To make efficient use of FocusPixels, an algorithm is proposed which generates compact rectangular FocusChips which enclose FocusPixels. The detector is only applied inside FocusChips, which reduces computation while processing finer scales. Different types of error can arise when detections from FocusChips of multiple scales are combined, hence techniques to correct them are proposed. AutoFocus obtains an mAP of 47.9% (68.3% at 50% overlap) on the COCO test-dev set while processing 6.4 images per second on a Titan X (Pascal) GPU. This is 2.5X faster than our multi-scale baseline detector and matches its mAP. The number of pixels processed in the pyramid can be reduced by 5X with a 1% drop in mAP.

State-of-the-art methods such as Faster-RCNN, FPN and R-FCN have achieved high accuracy in challenging benchmark datasets. However, these methods require fully annotated object bounding boxes for training, which are incredibly hard to scale up due to the high annotation cost. Weakly-supervised methods, on the other hand, only require image-level labels for training, but the performance is far below their fully-supervised counterparts. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised large scale fine-grained detection method, which only needs bounding box annotations of a smaller number of coarse-grained classes and image-level labels of large scale fine-grained classes, and can detect all classes at nearly fully-supervised accuracy. We achieve this by utilizing the correlations between coarse-grained and fine-grained classes with shared backbone, soft-attention based proposal re-ranking, and a dual-level memory module. Experiment results show that our methods can achieve close accuracy on object detection to state-of-the-art fully-supervised methods on two large scale datasets, ImageNet and OpenImages, with only a small fraction of fully annotated classes."}

The localization information of the MIDNs is further coupled to obtain tighter bounding boxes and localize multiple objects. We also introduce a Segmentation Guided Proposal Removal (SGPR) algorithm to guarantee the MIL constraint after the removal and ensure the robustness of C-MIDN. Through a simple implementation of the C-MIDN with online detector refinement, we obtain 53.6% and 50.3% mAP on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 benchmarks respectively, which significantly outperform the previous state-of-the-arts."}

However, models used for generating scene layouts from textual description largely ignore plausible visual variations within the structure dictated by the text. We propose LayoutVAE, a variational autoencoder based framework for generating stochastic scene layouts. LayoutVAE is a versatile modeling framework that allows for generating full image layouts given a label set, or per label layouts for an existing image given a new label. In addition, it is also capable of detecting unusual layouts, potentially providing a way to evaluate layout generation problem. Extensive experiments on MNIST-Layouts and challenging COCO 2017 Panoptic dataset verifies the effectiveness of our proposed framework."}

Unlike recent methods that leverage deep learning to perform black-box regression from image to orientation parameters, we propose an end-to-end framework that incorporates explicit geometric reasoning. In particular, we design a network that predicts two representations of scene geometry, in both the local camera and global reference coordinate systems, and solves for the camera orientation as the rotation that best aligns these two predictions via a differentiable least squares module. This network can be trained end-to-end, and can be supervised with both ground truth camera poses and intermediate representations of surface geometry. We evaluate UprightNet on the single-image camera orientation task on synthetic and real datasets, and show significant improvements over prior state-of-the-art approaches."}

The key idea is to train a deep neural network to generate 3D shapes which, when rendered to images, are indistinguishable from ground truth images (for a discriminator) under various camera poses. Discriminating 2D images instead of 3D shapes allows tapping into unstructured 2D photo collections instead of relying on curated (e.g., aligned, annotated, etc.) 3D data sets. To establish constraints between 2D image observation and their 3D interpretation, we suggest a family of rendering layers that are effectively differentiable. This family includes visual hull, absorption-only (akin to x-ray), and emission-absorption. We can successfully reconstruct 3D shapes from unstructured 2D images and extensively evaluate PlatonicGAN on a range of synthetic and real data sets achieving consistent improvements over baseline methods. We further show that PlatonicGAN can be combined with 3D supervision to improve on and in some cases even surpass the quality of 3D-supervised methods."}

In this context, the design of descriptors that efficiently and uniquely identifies keypoints, to be matched, is of central importance. Numerous descriptors have been developed for dealing with affine/perspective warps, but few can also handle non-rigid deformations. In this paper, we introduce a novel binary RGB-D descriptor invariant to isometric deformations. Our method uses geodesic isocurves on smooth textured manifolds. It combines appearance and geometric information from RGB-D images to tackle non-rigid transformations. We used our descriptor to track multiple textured depth maps and demonstrate that it produces reliable feature descriptors even in the presence of strong non-rigid deformations and depth noise. The experiments show that our descriptor outperforms different state-of-the-art descriptors in both precision-recall and recognition rate metrics. We also provide to the community a new dataset composed of annotated RGB-D images of different objects (shirts, cloths, paintings, bags), subjected to strong non-rigid deformations, to evaluate point correspondence algorithms."}

CDTB is recorded by several passive and active RGB-D setups and contains indoor as well as outdoor sequences acquired in direct sunlight. The CDTB dataset is the largest and most diverse dataset in RGB-D tracking, with an order of magnitude larger number of frames than related datasets. The sequences have been carefully recorded to contain significant object pose change, clutter, occlusion, and periods of long-term target absence to enable tracker evaluation under realistic conditions. Sequences are per-frame annotated with 13 visual attributes for detailed analysis. Experiments with RGB and RGB-D trackers show that CDTB is more challenging than previous datasets. State-of-the-art RGB trackers outperform the recent RGB-D trackers, indicating a large gap between the two fields, which has not been previously detected by the prior benchmarks. Based on the results of the analysis we point out opportunities for future research in RGB-D tracker design."}

In this work, we propose Additive Focal Variational Auto-encoder (AF-VAE), a novel approach that can arbitrarily manipulate high-resolution face images using a simple yet effective model and only weak supervision of reconstruction and KL divergence losses. First, a novel additive Gaussian Mixture assumption is introduced with an unsupervised clustering mechanism in the structural latent space, which endows better disentanglement and boosts multi-modal representation with external memory. Second, to improve the perceptual quality of synthesized results, two simple strategies in architecture design are further tailored and discussed on the behavior of Human Visual System (HVS) for the first time, allowing for fine control over the model complexity and sample quality. Human opinion studies and new state-of-the-art Inception Score (IS) / Frechet Inception Distance (FID) demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing algorithms, advancing both the fidelity and extremity of face manipulation task."}

These jointly occurred angle variations make face recognition challenging. Current public face databases mainly consider the case of yaw variations. In this paper, a new large-scale Multi-yaw Multi-pitch high-quality database is proposed for Facial Pose Analysis (M2FPA), including face frontalization, face rotation, facial pose estimation and pose-invariant face recognition. It contains 397,544 images of 229 subjects with yaw, pitch, attribute, illumination and accessory. M2FPA is the most comprehensive multi-view face database for facial pose analysis. Further, we provide an effective benchmark for face frontalization and pose-invariant face recognition on M2FPA with several state-of-the-art methods, including DR-GAN, TP-GAN and CAPG-GAN. We believe that the new database and benchmark can significantly push forward the advance of facial pose analysis in real-world applications. Moreover, a simple yet effective parsing guided discriminator is introduced to capture the local consistency during GAN optimization. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results on M2FPA and Multi-PIE demonstrate the superiority of our face frontalization method. Baseline results for both face synthesis and face recognition from state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the challenge offered by this new database."}

These methods incorporate a fixed additive margin to all the classes, ignoring the class imbalance problem. However, imbalanced problem widely exists in various real-world face datasets, in which samples from some classes are in a higher number than others. We argue that the number of a class would influence its demand for the additive margin. In this paper, we introduce a new margin-aware reinforcement learning based loss function, namely fair loss, in which each class will learn an appropriate adaptive margin by Deep Q-learning. Specifically, we train an agent to learn a margin adaptive strategy for each class, and make the additive margins for different classes more reasonable. Our method has better performance than present large-margin loss functions on three benchmarks, Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW), Youtube Faces (YTF) and MegaFace, which demonstrates that our method could learn better face representation on imbalanced face datasets."}

The generator consists of multiple progressive steps. At each step a shadow attention detector is firstly exploited to generate an attention map which specifies shadow regions in the input image. Given the attention map, a negative residual by a shadow remover encoder will recover a shadow-lighter or even a shadow-free image. The discriminator is designed to classify whether the output image in the last progressive step is real or fake. Moreover, ARGAN is suitable to be trained with a semi-supervised strategy to make full use of sufficient unsupervised data. The experiments on four public datasets have demonstrated that our ARGAN is robust to detect both simple and complex shadows and to produce more realistic shadow removal results. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially in detail of recovering shadow areas."}

In particular, we focus on large-scale computer vision problems, such as bundle adjustment, where Non-Linear Least Square (NLLS) solvers are the current workhorse. In this context, NLLS-based state of the art algorithms have been designed either to quickly improve the target objective and find a local minimum close to the initial value of the parameters, or to have a strong ability to escape poor local minima. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm relying on multi-objective optimization which allows to match those two properties. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm has an ability to escape poor local minima that is on par with the best performing algorithms with a faster decrease of the target objective."}

In order to robustly handle ambiguities, noise and repetitive patterns in challenging real-world settings, it is essential to take geometric consistency between points into account. Computationally, the multi-matching problem is difficult. It can be phrased as simultaneously solving multiple (NP-hard) quadratic assignment problems (QAPs) that are coupled via cycle-consistency constraints. The main limitations of existing multi-matching methods are that they either ignore geometric consistency and thus have limited robustness, or they are restricted to small-scale problems due to their (relatively) high computational cost. We address these shortcomings by introducing a Higher-order Projected Power Iteration method, which is (i) efficient and scales to tens of thousands of points, (ii) straightforward to implement, (iii) able to incorporate geometric consistency, (iv) guarantees cycle-consistent multi-matchings, and (iv) comes with theoretical convergence guarantees. Experimentally we show that our approach is superior to existing methods."}

Existing research has primarily focused on generating a single image from available conditioning information in one step. One practical extension beyond one-step generation is a system that generates an image iteratively, conditioned on ongoing linguistic input or feedback. This is significantly more challenging than one-step generation tasks, as such a system must understand the contents of its generated images with respect to the feedback history, the current feedback, as well as the interactions among concepts present in the feedback history. In this work, we present a recurrent image generation model which takes into account both the generated output up to the current step as well as all past instructions for generation. We show that our model is able to generate the background, add new objects, and apply simple transformations to existing objects. We believe our approach is an important step toward interactive generation. Code and data is available at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/generative-neural-visual-artist-geneva/."}

Suffering from the high predictability with non-visual information, relationship models tend to fit the statistical bias rather than \"learning\" to infer the relationships from images. To encourage further development in visual relationships, we propose a novel method to mine more valuable relationships by automatically pruning visually-irrelevant relationships. We construct a new scene graph dataset named Visually-Relevant Relationships Dataset (VrR-VG) based on Visual Genome. Compared with existing datasets, the performance gap between learnable and statistical method is more significant in VrR-VG, and frequency-based analysis does not work anymore. Moreover, we propose to learn a relationship-aware representation by jointly considering instances, attributes and relationships. By applying the representation-aware feature learned on VrR-VG, the performances of image captioning and visual question answering are systematically improved, which demonstrates the effectiveness of both our dataset and features embedding schema. Both our VrR-VG dataset and representation-aware features will be made publicly available soon."}

This approach relies on photo-consistency to evaluate the goodness of a depth estimate. It generally produces very accurate results; however, the reconstructed model often lacks completeness, especially in correspondence of broad untextured areas where the photo-consistency metrics are unreliable. Assuming the untextured areas piecewise planar, in this paper we generate novel PatchMatch hypotheses so to expand reliable depth estimates in neighboring untextured regions. At the same time, we modify the photo-consistency measure such to favor standard or novel PatchMatch depth hypotheses depending on the textureness of the considered area. We also propose a depth refinement step to filter wrong estimates and to fill the gaps on both the depth maps and normal maps while preserving the discontinuities. The effectiveness of our new methods has been tested against several state of the art algorithms in the publicly available ETH3D dataset containing a wide variety of high and low-resolution images."}

We further leverage recent advances in 3D pose estimation to constrain the joint semantic instance segmentation and 4D temporally coherent reconstruction. This enables per person semantic instance segmentation of multiple interacting people in complex dynamic scenes. Extensive evaluation of the joint visual scene understanding framework against state-of-the-art methods on challenging indoor and outdoor sequences demonstrates a significant (approx 40%) improvement in semantic segmentation, reconstruction and scene flow accuracy."}

Recent deep learning based methods depend on learning global geometry from self-reconstruction. However, these methods are still suffering from ineffective learning of local geometry, which significantly limits the discriminability of learned features. To resolve this issue, we propose MAP-VAE to enable the learning of global and local geometry by jointly leveraging global and local self-supervision. To enable effective local self-supervision, we introduce multi-angle analysis for point clouds. In a multi-angle scenario, we first split a point cloud into a front half and a back half from each angle, and then, train MAP-VAE to learn to predict a back half sequence from the corresponding front half sequence. MAP-VAE performs this half-to-half prediction using RNN to simultaneously learn each local geometry and the spatial relationship among them. In addition, MAP-VAE also learns global geometry via self-reconstruction, where we employ a variational constraint to facilitate novel shape generation. The outperforming results in four shape analysis tasks show that MAP-VAE can learn more discriminative global or local features than the state-of-the-art methods."}

Among them the approaches that generate cost volumes based on the plane-sweeping algorithm and then use them for feature matching have shown to be very prominent recently. The plane-sweep volumes are essentially anisotropic in depth and spatial directions, but they are often approximated by isotropic cost volumes in those methods, which could be detrimental. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end deep learning network of P-MVSNet for multi-view stereo based on isotropic and anisotropic 3D convolutions. Our P-MVSNet consists of two core modules: a patch-wise aggregation module learns to aggregate the pixel-wise correspondence information of extracted features to generate a matching confidence volume, from which a hybrid 3D U-Net then infers a depth probability distribution and predicts the depth maps. We perform extensive experiments on the DTU and Tanks & Temples benchmark datasets, and the results show that the proposed P-MVSNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance over many existing methods on multi-view stereo."}

Learning-based prediction methods with explicit motion models often suffer from having to estimate large numbers of motion parameters with artificial regularization. Inspired by the success of sparse motion-based prediction for video compression, we propose a parametric video prediction on a sparse motion field composed of few critical pixels and their motion vectors. The prediction is achieved by gradually refining the estimate of a future frame in iterative, discrete steps. Along the way, the identification of critical pixels and their motion estimation are addressed by two neural networks trained under a reinforcement learning setting. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CaltchPed, UCF101 and CIF datasets in one-step and multi-step prediction tests.

By estimating a dense flow between source and target clothing regions, ClothFlow effectively models the geometric changes and naturally transfers the appearance to synthesize novel images as shown in Figure 1. We achieve this with a three-stage framework: 1) Conditioned on a target pose, we first estimate a person semantic layout to provide richer guidance to the generation process. 2) Built on two feature pyramid networks, a cascaded flow estimation network then accurately estimates the appearance matching between corresponding clothing regions. The resulting dense flow warps the source image to flexibly account for deformations. 3) Finally, a generative network takes the warped clothing regions as inputs and renders the target view. We conduct extensive experiments on the DeepFashion dataset for pose-guided person image generation and on the VITON dataset for the virtual try-on task. Strong qualitative and quantitative results validate the effectiveness of our method."}

Central to our method are multiple and overlapping local adversarial discriminators in a content-style disentangling network for achieving local detail transfer between facial images, with the use of asymmetric loss functions for dramatic makeup styles with high-frequency details. Existing techniques do not demonstrate or fail to transfer high-frequency details in a global adversarial setting, or train a single local discriminator only to ensure image structure consistency and thus work only for relatively simple styles. Unlike others, our proposed local adversarial discriminators can distinguish whether the generated local image details are consistent with the corresponding regions in the given reference image in cross-image style transfer in an unsupervised setting. Incorporating these technical contributions, we achieve not only state-of-the-art results on conventional styles but also novel results involving complex and dramatic styles with high-frequency details covering large areas across multiple facial features.

Here we present a new virtual try-on network, called VTNFP, to synthesize photo-realistic images given the images of a clothed person and a target clothing item. In order to better preserve clothing and body features, VTNFP follows a three-stage design strategy. First, it transforms the target clothing into a warped form compatible with the pose of the given person. Next, it predicts a body segmentation map of the person wearing the target clothing, delineating body parts as well as clothing regions. Finally, the warped clothing, body segmentation map and given person image are fused together for fine-scale image synthesis. A key innovation of VTNFP is the body segmentation map prediction module, which provides critical information to guide image synthesis in regions where body parts and clothing intersects, and is very beneficial for preventing blurry pictures and preserving clothing and body part details. Experiments on a fashion dataset demonstrate that VTNFP generates substantially better results than state-of-the-art methods."}

In contrast to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), PET is costly and involves injecting a radioactive substance into the patient. Motivated by developments in modality transfer in vision, we study the generation of certain types of PET images from MRI data. We derive new flow-based generative models which we show perform well in this small sample size regime (much smaller than dataset sizes available in standard vision tasks). Our formulation, DUAL-GLOW, is based on two invertible networks and a relation network that maps the latent spaces to each other. We discuss how given the prior distribution, learning the conditional distribution of PET given the MRI image reduces to obtaining the conditional distribution between the two latent codes w.r.t. the two image types. We also extend our framework to leverage \"side\" information (or attributes) when available. By controlling the PET generation through \"conditioning\" on age, our model is also able to capture brain FDG-PET (hypometabolism) changes, as a function of age. We present experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset with 826 subjects, and obtain good performance in PET image synthesis, qualitatively and quantitatively better than recent works."}

To automatically segment the cancerous regions, fully supervised segmentation algorithms require labor-intensive and time-consuming labeling at the pixel level. In this research, we propose CAMEL, a weakly supervised learning framework for histopathology image segmentation using only image-level labels. Using multiple instance learning (MIL)-based label enrichment, CAMEL splits the image into latticed instances and automatically generates instance-level labels. After label enrichment, the instance-level labels are further assigned to the corresponding pixels, producing the approximate pixel-level labels and making fully supervised training of segmentation models possible. CAMEL achieves comparable performance with the fully supervised approaches in both instance-level classification and pixel-level segmentation on CAMELYON16 and a colorectal adenoma dataset. Moreover, the generality of the automatic labeling methodology may benefit future weakly supervised learning studies for histopathology image analysis."}

Longitudinal image acquisitions are common in various scientific and biomedical studies where often each image sequence sample may also come together with various secondary (fixed or temporally dependent) measurements. The key goal is not only to estimate the parameters of a deep generative model for the given longitudinal data, but also to enable evaluation of how the temporal course of the generated longitudinal samples are influenced as a function of induced changes in the (secondary) temporal measurements (or events). Our proposed formulation incorporates recurrent subnetworks and temporal context gating, which provides a smooth transition in a temporal sequence of generated data that can be easily informed or modulated by secondary temporal conditioning variables. We show that the formulation works well despite the smaller sample sizes common in these applications. Our model is validated on two video datasets and a longitudinal Alzheimer's disease (AD) dataset for both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated samples. Further, using our generated longitudinal image samples, we show that we can capture the pathological progressions in the brain that turn out to be consistent with the existing literature, and could facilitate various types of downstream statistical analysis."}
