Different from previous studies using contrastive learning, we tackle the issue from an alternative perspective, i.e., by formulating the representation learning scheme in a generative manner. Typically, the neighboring image patches among one text line tend to have similar styles, including the strokes, textures, colors, etc. Motivated by this common sense, we augment one image patch and use its neighboring patch as guidance to recover itself. Specifically, we propose a Similarity-Aware Normalization (SimAN) module to identify the different patterns and align the corresponding styles from the guiding patch. In this way, the network gains representation capability for distinguishing complex patterns such as messy strokes and cluttered backgrounds. Experiments show that the proposed SimAN significantly improves the representation quality and achieves promising performance. Moreover, we surprisingly find that our self-supervised generative network has impressive potential for data synthesis, text image editing, and font interpolation, which suggests that the proposed SimAN has a wide range of practical applications."}

Hashing aims to learn a binary-output function that maps an image to a binary vector. For optimal retrieval performance, producing balanced hash codes with low-quantization error to bridge the gap between the learning stage's continuous relaxation and the inference stage's discrete quantization is important. However, in the existing deep supervised hashing methods, coding balance and low-quantization error are difficult to achieve and involve several losses. We argue that this is because the existing quantization approaches in these methods are heuristically constructed and not effective to achieve these objectives. This paper considers an alternative approach to learning the quantization constraints. The task of learning balanced codes with low quantization error is re-formulated as matching the learned distribution of the continuous codes to a pre-defined discrete, uniform distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing the distance between two distributions. We then propose a computationally efficient distributional distance by leveraging the discrete property of the hash functions. This distributional distance is a valid distance and enjoys lower time and sample complexities. The proposed single-loss quantization objective can be integrated into any existing supervised hashing method to improve code balance and quantization error. Experiments confirm that the proposed approach substantially improves the performance of several representative hashing methods."}

However, the shape of light curtains have so far been limited to ruled surfaces, i.e., surfaces composed of straight lines. In this work, we propose Holocurtains: a light-efficient approach to producing light curtains of arbitrary shape. The key idea is to synchronize a rolling-shutter camera with a 2D holographic projector, which steers (rather than block) light to generate bright structured light patterns. Our prototype projector uses a binary digital micromirror device (DMD) to generate the holographic interference patterns at high speeds. Our system produces 3D light curtains that cannot be achieved with traditional light curtain setups and thus enables all-new applications, including the ability to simultaneously capture multiple light curtains in a single frame, detect subtle changes in scene geometry, and transform any 3D surface into an optical touch interface."}

This is an important yet challenging problem due to the under-constrained nature of the monocular setting. Existing SfT techniques predominantly use geometric and simplified deformation models, which often limits their reconstruction abilities. In contrast to previous works, this paper proposes a new SfT approach explaining 2D observations through physical simulations accounting for forces and material properties. Our differentiable physics simulator regularises the surface evolution and optimises the material elastic properties such as bending coefficients, stretching stiffness and density. We use a differentiable renderer to minimise the dense reprojection error between the estimated 3D states and the input images and recover the deformation parameters using an adaptive gradient-based optimisation. For the evaluation, we record with an RGB-D camera challenging real surfaces exposed to physical forces with various material properties and textures. Our approach significantly reduces the 3D reconstruction error compared to multiple competing methods. For the source code and data, see https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/phi-SfT/."}

However, due to the high training costs and the unconsciousness of downstream usages, most self-supervised learning methods lack the capability to correspond to the diversities of downstream scenarios, as there are various data domains, latency constraints and etc. Neural architecture search (NAS) is one universally acknowledged fashion to conquer the issues above, but applying NAS on SSL seems impossible as there is no label or metric provided for judging model selection. In this paper, we present DATA, a simple yet effective NAS approach specialized for SSL that provides Domain-Aware and Task-Aware pre-training. Specifically, we (i) train a supernet which could be deemed as a set of millions of networks covering a wide range of model scales without any label, (ii) propose a flexible searching mechanism compatible with SSL that enables finding networks of different computation costs, for various downstream vision tasks and data domains without explicit metric provided. Instantiated With MoCov2, our method achieves promising results across a wide range of computation costs on downstream tasks, including image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. DATA is orthogonal to most existing SSL methods and endows them the ability of customization on downstream needs. Extensive experiments on other SSL methods, including BYOL, ReSSL and DenseCL demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method. Code would be made available soon."}

Specifically, we consider two kinds of pseudo labels for semantic- and instance-level supervision. Our key design is to provide object-level information for denoising pseudo labels and make use of their correlation for two-way mutual enhancement, thereby iteratively promoting the pseudo-label qualities.

However, it is cumbersome to apply the self-attention underlying transformer on large-scale point cloud data because point cloud is a long sequence and unevenly distributed in 3D space. To solve this issue, existing methods usually compute self-attention locally by grouping the points into clusters of the same size, or perform convolutional self-attention on a discretized representation. However, the former results in stochastic point dropout, while the latter typically has narrow attention field. In this paper, we propose a novel voxel-based architecture, namely Voxel Set Transformer (VoxSeT), to detect 3D objects from point clouds by means of set-to-set translation. VoxSeT is built upon a voxel-based set attention (VSA) module, which reduces the self-attention in each voxel by two cross-attentions and models features in a hidden space induced by a group of latent codes. With the VSA module, VoxSeT can manage voxelized point clusters with arbitrary size in a wide range, and process them in parallel with linear complexity. The proposed VoxSeT integrates the high performance of transformer with the efficiency of voxel-based model, which can be used as a good alternative to the convolutional and point-based backbones. VoxSeT reports competitive results on the KITTI and Waymo detection benchmarks. The source code of VoxSeT will be released."}

We introduce Bongard-HOI, a new visual reasoning benchmark that focuses on compositional learning of human-object interactions (HOIs) from natural images. It is inspired by two desirable characteristics from the classical Bongard problems (BPs): 1) few-shot concept learning, and 2) context-dependent reasoning. We carefully curate the few-shot instances with hard negatives, where positive and negative images only disagree on action labels, making mere recognition of object categories insufficient to complete our benchmarks. We also design multiple test sets to systematically study the generalization of visual learning models, where we vary the overlap of the HOI concepts between the training and test sets of few- shot instances, from partial to no overlaps. Bongard-HOI presents a substantial challenge to today's visual recognition models. The state-of-the-art HOI detection model achieves only 62% accuracy on few-shot binary prediction while even amateur human testers on MTurk have 91% accuracy. With the Bongard-HOI benchmark, we hope to further advance research efforts in visual reasoning, especially in holistic perception-reasoning systems and better representation learning."}

Our network recursively decomposes an input 3D shape into two parts, resulting in a binary tree hierarchy. Each level of the tree corresponds to an assembly of shape parts, represented as implicit functions, to reconstruct the input shape. At each node of the tree, simultaneous feature decoding and shape decomposition are carried out by their respective feature and part decoders, with weight sharing across the same hierarchy level. As an implicit field decoder, the part decoder is designed to decompose a sub-shape, via a two-way branched reconstruction, where each branch predicts a set of parameters defining a Gaussian to serve as a local point distribution for shape reconstruction. With reconstruction losses accounted for at each hierarchy level and a decomposition loss at each node, our network training does not require any ground-truth segmentations, let alone hierarchies. Through extensive experiments and comparisons to state-of-the-art alternatives, we demonstrate the quality, consistency, and interpretability of hierarchical structural inference by RIM-Net."}

To predict pose more accurately, deeply learned dense maps replaced sparse templates. Dense methods also improved pose estimation in the presence of occlusion. More recently researchers have shown improvements by learning object fragments as segmentation. In this work, we present a discrete descriptor, which can represent the object surface densely. By incorporating a hierarchical binary grouping, we can encode the object surface very efficiently. Moreover, we propose a coarse to fine training strategy, which enables fine-grained correspondence prediction. Finally, by matching predicted codes with object surface and using a PnP solver, we estimate the 6DoF pose. Results on the public LM-O and YCB-V datasets show major improvement over the state of the art w.r.t. ADD(-S) metric, even surpassing RGB-D based methods in some cases."}

While such models can provide a powerful score for matching and subsequent zero-shot tasks, they are not capable of generating caption given an image. In this work, we repurpose such models to generate a descriptive text given an image at inference time, without any further training or tuning step. This is done by combining the visual-semantic model with a large language model, benefiting from the knowledge in both web-scale models. The resulting captions are much less restrictive than those obtained by supervised captioning methods. Moreover, as a zero-shot learning method, it is extremely flexible and we demonstrate its ability to perform image arithmetic in which the inputs can be either images or text and the output is a sentence. This enables novel high-level vision capabilities such as comparing two images or solving visual analogy tests. Our code is available at: https://github.com/YoadTew/zero-shot-image-to-text."}

To handle the limited-data in few-shot regimes, recent methods tend to collectively use a set of local features to densely represent an image instead of using a mixed global feature. They generally explore a unidirectional paradigm, e.g., find the nearest support feature for every query feature and aggregate these local matches for a joint classification. In this paper, we propose a novel Mutual Centralized Learning (MCL) to fully affiliate these two disjoint dense features sets in a bidirectional paradigm. We first associate each local feature with a particle that can bidirectionally random walk in a discrete feature space. To estimate the class probability, we propose the dense features' accessibility that measures the expected number of visits to the dense features of that class in a Markov process. We relate our method to learning a centrality on an affiliation network and demonstrate its capability to be plugged in existing methods by highlighting centralized local features. Experiments show that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art."}

Given an input 3D shape, our network reconstructs it by an assembly of quadric surface primitives via constructive solid geometry (CSG) operations. Without any ground-truth shape assemblies, our self-supervised network is trained with a reconstruction loss, leading to faithful 3D reconstructions with sharp edges and plausible CSG trees. While the parametric nature of CAD models does make them more predictable locally, at the shape level, there is much structural and topological variation, which presents a significant generalizability challenge to state-of-the-art neural models for 3D shapes. Our network addresses this challenge by adaptive training with respect to each test shape, with which we fine-tune the network that was pre-trained on a model collection. We evaluate our learning framework on both ShapeNet and ABC, the largest and most diverse CAD dataset to date, in terms of reconstruction quality, sharp edges, compactness, and interpretability, to demonstrate superiority over current alternatives for neural CAD reconstruction."}

Besides, the existing works ignore Federated Learning (FL) scenarios, failing to make full use of distributed multi-source datasets with rich actual scenes to learn more a powerful TP model. In this paper, we make up for the above defects and propose ATPFL to help users federate multi-source trajectory datasets to automatically design and train a powerful TP model. In ATPFL, we build an effective TP search space by analyzing and summarizing the existing works. Then, based on the characters of this search space, we design a relation-sequence-aware search strategy, realizing the automatic design of the TP model. Finally, we find appropriate federated training methods to respectively support the TP model search and final model training under the FL framework, ensuring both the search efficiency and the final model performance. Extensive experimental results show that ATPFL can help users gain well-performed TP models, achieving better results than the existing TP models trained on the single-source dataset."}

Meanwhile, supervised denoisers trained on synthetic data perform poorly in practice. Self-supervised denoisers, which learn only from single noisy images, solve the data collection problem. However, self-supervised denoising methods, especially blindspot-driven ones, suffer sizable information loss during input or network design. The absence of valuable information dramatically reduces the upper bound of denoising performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient approach called Blind2Unblind to overcome the information loss in blindspot-driven denoising methods. First, we introduce a global-aware mask mapper that enables global perception and accelerates training. The mask mapper samples all pixels at blind spots on denoised volumes and maps them to the same channel, allowing the loss function to optimize all blind spots at once. Second, we propose a re-visible loss to train the denoising network and make blind spots visible. The denoiser can learn directly from raw noise images without losing information or being trapped in identity mapping. We also theoretically analyze the convergence of the re-visible loss. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to previous work.

Optimizing this representation with pre-trained geometric priors enables detailed reconstruction on large indoor scenes.

Existing methods strive for better representation of local elements and their relations without sceneconditioned knowledge, which may cause ambiguity merely based on the understanding of individual points and object candidates. Instead, HyperDet3D simultaneously learns scene-agnostic embeddings and scene-specific knowledge through scene-conditioned hypernetworks. More specifically, our HyperDet3D not only explores the sharable abstracts from various 3D scenes, but also adapts the detector to the given scene at test time. We propose a discriminative Multi-head Scene-specific Attention (MSA) module to dynamically control the layer parameters of the detector conditioned on the fusion of scene-conditioned knowledge. Our HyperDet3D achieves state-of-the-art results on the 3D object detection benchmark of the ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets.

In this work, we present Cross Layer Refinement Network (CLRNet) aiming at fully utilizing both high-level and low-level features in lane detection. In particular, it first detects lanes with high-level semantic features then performs refinement based on low-level features. In this way, we can exploit more contextual information to detect lanes while leveraging local detailed lane features to improve localization accuracy. We present ROIGather to gather global context, which further enhances the feature representation of lanes.

Despite impressive progress, prior methods always need to access the raw source data and develop data-dependent alignment approaches to recognize the target samples in a transductive learning manner, which may raise privacy concerns from source individuals. Several recent studies resort to an alternative solution by exploiting the well-trained white-box model from the source domain, yet, it may still leak the raw data via generative adversarial learning. This paper studies a practical and interesting setting for UDA, where only black-box source models (i.e., only network predictions are available) are provided during adaptation in the target domain. To solve this problem, we propose a new two-step knowledge adaptation framework called DIstill and fine-tuNE (DINE). Taking into consideration the target data structure, DINE first distills the knowledge from the source predictor to a customized target model, then fine-tunes the distilled model to further fit the target domain. Besides, neural networks are not required to be identical across domains in DINE, even allowing effective adaptation on a low-resource device. Empirical results on three UDA scenarios (i.e., single-source, multi-source, and partial-set) confirm that DINE achieves highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-dependent approaches.

In addition, we propose a planar-geometry aware loss function with normals and gradients of normals to supervise the planeness of walls and turning of corners. We propose an efficient network, LGT-Net, for room layout estimation, which contains a novel Transformer architecture called SWG-Transformer to model geometry relations. SWG-Transformer consists of (Shifted) Window Blocks and Global Blocks to combine the local and global geometry relations.

Due to the distinct data properties between text and image, it is challenging for a network to well align text and pixel-level features.

Inspired by the recent advance in Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), in this paper, we propose an end-to-end CLIP-Driven Referring Image Segmentation framework (CRIS). To transfer the multi-modal knowledge effectively, CRIS resorts to vision-language decoding and contrastive learning for achieving the text-to-pixel alignment. More specifically, we design a vision-language decoder to propagate fine-grained semantic information from textual representations to each pixel-level activation, which promotes consistency between the two modalities. In addition, we present text-to-pixel contrastive learning to explicitly enforce the text feature similar to the related pixel-level features and dissimilar to the irrelevances.

However, obtaining well-aligned noisy-clean training image pairs for each specific scenario is complicated and costly in practice. Consequently, applying a conventional supervised denoising network on in-the-wild noisy inputs is not straightforward. Although several studies have challenged this problem without strong supervision, they rely on less practical assumptions and cannot be applied to practical situations directly. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel and powerful self-supervised denoising method called CVF-SID based on a Cyclic multi-Variate Function (CVF) module and a self-supervised image disentangling (SID) framework. The CVF module can output multiple decomposed variables of the input and take a combination of the outputs back as an input in a cyclic manner. Our CVF-SID can disentangle a clean image and noise maps from the input by leveraging various self-supervised loss terms. Unlike several methods that only consider the signal-independent noise models, we also deal with signal-dependent noise components for real-world applications. Furthermore, we do not rely on any prior assumptions about the underlying noise distribution, making CVF-SID more generalizable toward realistic noise. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CVF-SID achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised image denoising performance and is comparable to other existing approaches.

The core of our method is to design a basic pattern that can be expanded periodically, and make the pattern after random cropping and deformation still have an adversarial effect, then we can process the flat cloth with an adversarial pattern into any 3D clothes. The results showed that the optimized \"QR code\" pattern lowered the Average Precision (AP) of YOLOv3 by 87.7%, while the random \"QR code\" pattern and blank pattern lowered the AP of YOLOv3 by 57.9% and 30.1%, respectively, in the digital world.

If DeepFakes are not controlled timely and properly, they would become a real threat to both celebrities and ordinary people. Precautions such as adding perturbations to the source inputs will make DeepFake results look distorted from the perspective of human eyes. However, previous method doesn't explore whether the disrupted images can still spoof DeepFake detectors. This is critical for many applications where DeepFake detectors are used to discriminate between DeepFake data and real data due to the huge cost of examining a large amount of data manually. We argue that the detectors do not share a similar perspective as human eyes, which might still be spoofed by the disrupted data. Besides, the existing disruption methods rely on iteration-based perturbation generation algorithms, which is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel DeepFake disruption algorithm called \"DeepFake Disrupter\". By training a perturbation generator, we can add the human-imperceptible perturbations to source images that need to be protected without any backpropagation update. The DeepFake results of these protected source inputs would not only look unrealistic by the human eye but also can be distinguished by DeepFake detectors easily. For example, experimental results show that by adding our trained perturbations, fake images generated by StarGAN can result in a 10   20% increase in F1-score evaluated by various DeepFake detectors."}

We also propose evaluations of generality of architecture, skill-concept transfer, and learning efficiency that may inform future work on general purpose vision. Our experiments indicate GPV-1 is effective at multiple tasks, reuses some concept knowledge across tasks, can perform the Referring Expressions task zero-shot, and further improves upon the zero-shot performance using a few training samples."}

Yet, deep networks require expensive annotated datasets trained on costly hardware and do not generalize to even slightly different domains, and minor problem variants. Here, we address these issues by injecting deep vanishing point detection networks with prior knowledge. This prior knowledge no longer needs to be learned from data, saving valuable annotation efforts and compute, unlocking realistic few-sample scenarios, and reducing the impact of domain changes. Moreover, the interpretability of the priors allows to adapt deep networks to minor problem variations such as switching between Manhattan and non-Manhattan worlds. We seamlessly incorporate two geometric priors: (i) Hough Transform -- mapping image pixels to straight lines, and (ii) Gaussian sphere -- mapping lines to great circles whose intersections denote vanishing points. Experimentally, we ablate our choices and show comparable accuracy to existing models in the large-data setting. We validate our model's improved data efficiency, robustness to domain changes, adaptability to non-Manhattan settings."}

However, the training data must be captured in scenes without moving objects. To push the envelope of accuracy, recent methods tend to increase their model parameters. In this paper, an unsupervised learning framework is proposed to jointly predict monocular depth and complete 3D motion including the motions of moving objects and camera. (1) Recurrent modulation units are used to adaptively and iteratively fuse encoder and decoder features. This improves the single-image depth inference without overspending model parameters. (2) Instead of using a single set of filters for upsampling, multiple sets of filters are devised for the residual upsampling. This facilitates the learning of edge-preserving filters and leads to the improved performance. (3) A warping-based network is used to estimate a motion field of moving objects without using semantic priors. This breaks down the requirement of scene rigidity and allows to use general videos for the unsupervised learning. The motion field is further regularized by an outlier-aware training loss. Despite the depth model just uses a single image in test time and 2.97M parameters, it achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI and Cityscapes benchmarks."}

In our empirical study we find that locked pre-trained image models with unlocked text models work best. We call this instance of contrastive-tuning \"Locked-image Tuning\" (LiT), which just teaches a text model to read out good representations from a pre-trained image model for new tasks. A LiT model gains the capability of zero-shot transfer to new vision tasks, such as image classification or retrieval. The proposed LiT is widely applicable; it works reliably with multiple pre-training methods (supervised and unsupervised) and across diverse architectures (ResNet, Vision Transformers and MLP-Mixer) using three different image-text datasets. With the transformer-based pre-trained ViT-g/14 model, the LiT model achieves 84.5% zero-shot transfer accuracy on the ImageNet test set, and 81.1% on the challenging out-of-distribution ObjectNet test set."}

Our approach consists of two main stages: a geometry reasoner and a renderer. To render a novel view, the geometry reasoner first constructs cascaded cost volumes for each nearby source view. Then, using a Transformer-based attention mechanism and the cascaded cost volumes, the renderer infers geometry and appearance, and renders detailed images via classical volume rendering techniques. This architecture, in particular, allows sophisticated occlusion reasoning, gathering information from consistent source views. Moreover, our method can easily be fine-tuned on a single scene, and renders competitive results with per-scene optimized neural rendering methods with a fraction of computational cost. Experiments show that GeoNeRF outperforms state-of-the-art generalizable neural rendering models on various synthetic and real datasets. Lastly, with a slight modification to the geometry reasoner, we also propose an alternative model that adapts to RGBD images. This model directly exploits the depth information often available thanks to depth sensors. The implementation code is available at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/geonerf."}

However, most existing methods are designed for global retouching and seldom pay attention to the local region, while the latter is actually much more tedious and time-consuming in photography pipelines. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive blend pyramid network, which aims to achieve fast local retouching on ultra high-resolution photos. The network is mainly composed of two components: a context-aware local retouching layer (LRL) and an adaptive blend pyramid layer (BPL). The LRL is designed to implement local retouching on low-resolution images, giving full consideration of the global context and local texture information, and the BPL is then developed to progressively expand the low-resolution results to the higher ones, with the help of the proposed adaptive blend module and refining module. Our method outperforms the existing methods by a large margin on two local photo retouching tasks and exhibits excellent performance in terms of running speed, achieving real-time inference on 4K images with a single NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU. Moreover, we introduce the first high-definition cloth retouching dataset CRHD-3K to promote the research on local photo retouching. The dataset is available at https://github.com/youngLBW/CRHD-3K."}

Beyond instance level 6D object pose estimation methods, estimating category-level pose and shape has become a promising trend. As such, a new research field needs to be supported by well-designed datasets. To provide a benchmark with high-quality ground truth annotations to the community, we introduce a multimodal dataset for category-level object pose estimation with photometrically challenging objects termed PhoCaL. PhoCaL comprises 60 high quality 3D models of household objects over 8 categories including highly reflective, transparent and symmetric objects. We developed a novel robot-supported multi-modal (RGB, depth, polarisation) data acquisition and annotation process. It ensures sub-millimeter accuracy of the pose for opaque textured, shiny and transparent objects, no motion blur and perfect camera synchronisation. To set a benchmark for our dataset, state-of-the-art RGB-D and monocular RGB methods are evaluated on the challenging scenes of PhoCaL."}

The classical prevailing approaches were based on maximizing patch similarity between the input and generated output. Recently, single-image GANs were introduced as a superior and more sophisticated solution to image manipulation tasks. Moreover, they offered the opportunity not only to manipulate a given image, but also to generate a large and diverse set of different outputs from a single natural image. This gave rise to new tasks, which are considered \"DL-only\". However, despite their impressiveness, single-image GANs require long training time (usually hours) for each image and each task and often suffer from visual artifacts. In this paper we revisit the classical patch-based methods, and show that - unlike previously believed -- classical methods can be adapted to tackle these novel \"GAN-only\" tasks. Moreover, they do so better and faster than single-image GAN-based methods. More specifically, we show that: (i) by introducing slight modifications, classical patch-based methods are able to unconditionally generate diverse images based on a single natural image; (ii) the generated output visual quality exceeds that of single-image GANs by a large margin (confirmed both quantitatively and qualitatively); (iii) they are orders of magnitude faster (runtime reduced from hours to seconds)."}

In Uformer, there are two core designs. First, we introduce a novel locally-enhanced window (LeWin) Transformer block, which performs non-overlapping window-based self-attention instead of global self-attention. It significantly reduces the computational complexity on high resolution feature map while capturing local context. Second, we propose a learnable multi-scale restoration modulator in the form of a multi-scale spatial bias to adjust features in multiple layers of the Uformer decoder. Our modulator demonstrates superior capability for restoring details for various image restoration tasks while introducing marginal extra parameters and computational cost. Powered by these two designs, Uformer enjoys a high capability for capturing both local and global dependencies for image restoration. To evaluate our approach, extensive experiments are conducted on several image restoration tasks, including image denoising, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring and deraining. Without bells and whistles, our Uformer achieves superior or comparable performance compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

This is challenging, as state-of-the-art methods rely on explicit class semantics obtained from large labeled datasets, and out-of-domain evaluation performance drops significantly. Here we propose a novel approach for mask proposals, Generic Grouping Networks (GGNs), constructed without semantic supervision. Our approach combines a local measure of pixel affinity with instance-level mask supervision, producing a training regimen designed to make the model as generic as the data diversity allows. We introduce a method for predicting Pairwise Affinities (PA), a learned local relationship between pairs of pixels. PA generalizes very well to unseen categories. From PA we construct a large set of pseudo-ground-truth instance masks; combined with human-annotated instance masks we train GGNs and significantly outperform the SOTA on open-world instance segmentation on various benchmarks including COCO, LVIS, ADE20K, and UVO."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2022", "Area": "CV", "Where": "CVPR", "Abbreviation": "SIOD", "Title": "Single Instance Annotated per Category per Image for Object Detection", "Abstract": "Object detection under imperfect data receives great attention recently. Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) suffers from severe localization issues due to the lack of instance-level annotation, while semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) remains challenging led by the inter-image discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data. In this study, we propose the Single Instance annotated Object Detection (SIOD), requiring only one instance annotation for each existing category in an image. Degraded from inter-task (WSOD) or inter-image (SSOD) discrepancies to the intra-image discrepancy, SIOD provides more reliable and rich prior knowledge for mining the rest of unlabeled instances and trades off the annotation cost and performance. Under the SIOD setting, we propose a simple yet effective framework, termed Dual-Mining (DMiner), which consists of a Similarity-based Pseudo Label Generating module (SPLG) and a Pixel-level Group Contrastive Learning module (PGCL). SPLG firstly mines latent instances from feature representation space to alleviate the annotation missing problem. To avoid being misled by inaccurate pseudo labels, we propose PGCL to boost the tolerance to false pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on MS COCO verify the feasibility of the SIOD setting and the superiority of the proposed method, which obtains consistent and significant improvements compared to baseline methods and achieves comparable results with fully supervised object detection (FSOD) methods with only 40% instances annotated."}

In a real scenario, multiple correlated human actions commonly occur in particular orders, forming semantically meaningful human activities. Conventional action recognition approaches focus on analyzing single actions. However, they fail to fully reason about the contextual relations between adjacent actions, which provide potential temporal logic for understanding long videos. In this paper, we propose a prompt-based framework, Bridge-Prompt (Br-Prompt), to model the semantics across adjacent actions, so that it simultaneously exploits both out-of-context and contextual information from a series of ordinal actions in instructional videos. More specifically, we reformulate the individual action labels as integrated text prompts for supervision, which bridge the gap between individual action semantics. The generated text prompts are paired with corresponding video clips, and together co-train the text encoder and the video encoder via a contrastive approach. The learned vision encoder has a stronger capability for ordinal-action-related downstream tasks, e.g. action segmentation and human activity recognition. We evaluate the performances of our approach on several video datasets: Georgia Tech Egocentric Activities (GTEA), 50Salads, and the Breakfast dataset. Br-Prompt achieves state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks. Code is available at: https://github.com/ttlmh/Bridge-Prompt."}

In this paper, we introduced a new semi-supervised learning framework, SimMatch, which simultaneously considers semantic similarity and instance similarity. In SimMatch, the consistency regularization will be applied on both semantic-level and instance-level. The different augmented views of the same instance are encouraged to have the same class prediction and similar similarity relationship respected to other instances. Next, we instantiated a labeled memory buffer to fully leverage the ground truth labels on instance-level and bridge the gaps between the semantic and instance similarities. Finally, we proposed the unfolding and aggregation operation which allows these two similarities be isomorphically transformed with each other. In this way, the semantic and instance pseudo-labels can be mutually propagated to generate more high-quality and reliable matching targets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SimMatch improves the performance of semi-supervised learning tasks across different benchmark datasets and different settings. Notably, with 400 epochs of training, SimMatch achieves 67.2%, and 74.4% Top-1 Accuracy with 1% and 10% labeled examples on ImageNet, which significantly outperforms the baseline methods and is better than previous semi-supervised learning frameworks."}

Specifically, we construct a distinct generative model and design an objective function that encourages the generative model to produce causal, compact, and faithful explanations. This is achieved by isolating the causal factors in the latent space of graphs by maximizing the information flow measurements. We theoretically analyze the cause-effect relationships in the proposed causal graph, identify node attributes as confounders between graphs and GNN predictions, and circumvent such confounder effect by leveraging the backdoor adjustment formula. Our framework is compatible with any GNNs, and it does not require access to the process by which the target GNN produces its predictions. In addition, it does not rely on the linear-independence assumption of the explained features, nor require prior knowledge on the graph learning tasks. We show a proof-of-concept of OrphicX on canonical classification problems on graph data. In particular, we analyze the explanatory subgraphs obtained from explanations for molecular graphs (i.e., Mutag) and quantitatively evaluate the explanation performance with frequently occurring subgraph patterns. Empirically, we show that OrphicX can effectively identify the causal semantics for generating causal explanations, significantly outperforming its alternatives."}

Previous works often have disregarded information at occluded regions. However, we argue that occluded regions have strong correlations with hands so that they can provide highly beneficial information for complete 3D hand mesh estimation. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel 3D hand mesh estimation network HandOccNet, that can fully exploits the information at occluded regions as a secondary means to enhance image features and make it much richer. To this end, we design two successive Transformer-based modules, called feature injecting transformer (FIT) and self-enhancing transformer (SET). FIT injects hand information into occluded region by considering their correlation. SET refines the output of FIT by using a self-attention mechanism. By injecting the hand information to the occluded region, our HandOccNet reaches the state-of-the-art performance on 3D hand mesh benchmarks that contain challenging hand-object occlusions.

In this paper, we seek to explore using pure transformers to build a generative adversarial network for high-resolution image synthesis. To this end, we believe that the local attention is crucial to strike the balance between computational efficiency and modeling capacity. Hence, the proposed generator adopts Swin transformer in a style-based architecture. To achieve larger receptive field, we propose double attention which simultaneously leverages the context of the local and the shifted windows, leading to improved generation quality. Moreover, we show that offering the knowledge of the absolute position that has lost in window-based transformers greatly benefits the generation quality. The proposed StyleSwin is scalable to high resolutions, with both the coarse geometry and fine structures benefit from the strong expressivity of transformers. However, blocking artifacts occur during high-resolution synthesis because performing the local attention in a block-wise manner may break the spatial coherency. To solve this, we empirically investigate various solutions, among which we find that employing a wavelet discriminator to examine the spectral discrepancy effectively suppresses the artifacts. Extensive experiments show the superiority over prior transformer-based GANs, especially on high resolutions, e.g., 1024x1024. The StyleSwin, without complex training strategies, excelling over StyleGAN on CelebA-HQ 1024, and achieves on-par performance on FFHQ-1024, proving the promise of using transformers for high-resolution image generation.

To this end, we propose an attention-based architecture named Cerberus and a tailored training framework. Our method effectively addresses aforementioned challenges and achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three tasks. Moreover, an in-depth analysis shows concept affinity consistent with human cognition, which inspires us to explore the possibility of extremely low-shot learning.

To handle the data imbalance, we devise Tail-class Feature Enhancement (TFE) for classifier learning. Furthermore, the current evaluation protocol for imbalanced SSL focuses only on balanced test sets, which has limited practicality in real-world scenarios.

The saved computation can be reallocated to increase resolution only for informative patches, resulting in performance improvement with no additional computation cost. This \"attend and zoom-in\" strategy is highly similar to human behavior when observing images.

However, the training of GAN is unstable, and it often introduces many perceptually unpleasant artifacts along with the generated details. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train a GAN-based SISR model which can stably generate perceptually realistic details while inhibiting visual artifacts. Based on the observation that the local statistics (e.g., residual variance) of artifact areas are often different from the areas of perceptually friendly details, we develop a framework to discriminate between GAN-generated artifacts and realistic details, and consequently generate an artifact map to regularize and stabilize the model training process. Our proposed locally discriminative learning (LDL) method is simple yet effective, which can be easily plugged in off-the-shelf SISR methods and boost their performance.

Through the infinitesimal analysis and Newton's second law, we derive the spatial-temporal contour vibration model of object shapes, which is mathematically reduced to second-order differential equation. To concretize the dynamic model, we transform the vibration model into the space of image features, and reparameterize the equation coefficients as the learnable state from feature domain. The contour changes are finally evolved in a progressive mode through the computation of contour vibration equation. Both the polygon contour evolution and the model optimization are modulated to form a close-looping end-to-end network.

Thanks to the decoupling, DT-Net implicitly learns a disentangled representation for the topology and shape in the latent space. Hence, it can enable novel disentangled controls for supporting various shape generation applications, eg, remix the topologies of 3D objects, that are not achievable by previous reconstruction works. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to produce high-quality meshes, particularly with diverse topologies, as compared with the state-of-the-art methods."}

The backdoored models behave normally on clean images, yet can be activated and output incorrect prediction if the input is stamped with a specific trigger pattern.Most existing backdoor attacks focus on manually defining imperceptible triggers in input space without considering the abnormality of triggers' latent representations in the poisoned model.These attacks are susceptible to backdoor detection algorithms and even visual inspection.In this paper, We propose a novel and stealthy backdoor attack - DEFEAT. It poisons the clean data using adaptive imperceptible perturbation and restricts latent representation during training process to strengthen our attack's stealthiness and resistance to defense algorithms.We conduct extensive experiments on multiple image classifiers using real-world datasets to demonstrate that our attack can 1) hold against the state-of-the-art defenses, 2) deceive the victim model with high attack success without jeopardizing model utility, and 3) provide practical stealthiness on image data."}

As only a fixed set of image-level object labels are available to the WSSS (weakly supervised semantic segmentation) model, it could be very difficult to suppress those diverse background regions consisting of open set objects. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross Language Image Matching (CLIMS) framework, based on the recently introduced Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, for WSSS. The core idea of our framework is to introduce natural language supervision to activate more complete object regions and suppress closely-related open background regions. In particular, we design object, background region and text label matching losses to guide the model to excite more reasonable object regions for CAM of each category. In addition, we design a co-occurring background suppression loss to prevent the model from activating closely-related background regions, with a predefined set of class-related background text descriptions. These designs enable the proposed CLIMS to generate a more complete and compact activation map for the target objects. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2012 dataset show that our CLIMS significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods."}

Advances in margin-based loss functions have resulted in enhanced discriminability of faces in the embedding space. Further, previous studies have studied the effect of adaptive losses to assign more importance to misclassified (hard) examples. In this work, we introduce another aspect of adaptiveness in the loss function, namely the image quality. We argue that the strategy to emphasize misclassified samples should be adjusted according to their image quality. Specifically, the relative importance of easy or hard samples should be based on the sample's image quality. We propose a new loss function that emphasizes samples of different difficulties based on their image quality. Our method achieves this in the form of an adaptive margin function by approximating the image quality with feature norms. Extensive experiments show that our method, AdaFace, improves the face recognition performance over the state-of-the-art (SoTA) on four datasets (IJB-B, IJB-C, IJB-S and TinyFace).

We show that the slow convergence results from the instability of bipartite graph matching which causes inconsistent optimization goals in early training stages. To address this issue, except for the Hungarian loss, our method additionally feeds ground-truth bounding boxes with noises into Transformer decoder and trains the model to reconstruct the original boxes, which effectively reduces the bipartite graph matching difficulty and leads to a faster convergence. Our method is universal and can be easily plugged into any DETR-like methods by adding dozens of lines of code to achieve a remarkable improvement. As a result, our DN-DETR results in a remarkable improvement (+1.9AP) under the same setting and achieves the best result (AP 43.4 and 48.6 with 12 and 50 epochs of training respectively) among DETR-like methods with ResNet-50 backbone.

Capturing such structures with image representations can greatly benefit the semantic understanding on various downstream tasks. Existing contrastive representation learning methods lack such an important model capability. In addition, the negative pairs used in these methods are not guaranteed to be semantically distinct, which could further hamper the structural correctness of learned image representations. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework called Hierarchical Contrastive Selective Coding (HCSC). In this framework, a set of hierarchical prototypes are constructed and also dynamically updated to represent the hierarchical semantic structures underlying the data in the latent space. To make image representations better fit such semantic structures, we employ and further improve conventional instance-wise and prototypical contrastive learning via an elaborate pair selection scheme. This scheme seeks to select more diverse positive pairs with similar semantics and more precise negative pairs with truly distinct semantics. On extensive downstream tasks, we verify the superior performance of HCSC over state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and the effectiveness of major model components is proved by plentiful analytical studies. We are continually building a comprehensive model zoo (see supplementary material). Our source code and model weights are available at https://github.com/gyfastas/HCSC."}

However, based on a thorough comparison of representative RecogTrans and InstDisc methods, we observe the great potential of RecogTrans on both semantic-related and temporal-related downstream tasks. Based on hard-label classification, existing RecogTrans approaches suffer from noisy supervision signals in pre-training. To mitigate this problem, we developed TransRank, a unified framework for recognizing Transformations in a Ranking formulation. TransRank provides accurate supervision signals by recognizing transformations relatively, consistently outperforming the classification-based formulation. Meanwhile, the unified framework can be instantiated with an arbitrary set of temporal or spatial transformations, demonstrating good generality. With a ranking-based formulation and several empirical practices, we achieve competitive performance on video retrieval and action recognition.Under the same setting, TransRank surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method by 6.4% on UCF101 and 8.3% on HMDB51 for action recognition (Top1 Acc); improves video retrieval on UCF101 by 20.4% (R@1). The promising results validate that RecogTrans is still a worth exploring paradigm for video self-supervised learning. Codes will be released at https://github.com/kennymckormick/TransRank."}

Recent progress in dynamic video depth prediction has focused on improving the output of monocular depth estimators by means of multi-view constraints while imposing little to no restrictions on the deformation of the dynamic parts of the scene. However, the theory of Non-Rigid Structure from Motion prescribes to constrain the deformations for 3D reconstruction. We thus propose a new model that departs significantly from this prior work. The idea is to fit a dynamic point cloud to the video data using Sinkhorn's algorithm to associate the 3D points to 2D pixels and use a differentiable point renderer to ensure the compatibility of the 3D deformations with the measured optical flow. In this manner, our algorithm, called Keypoint Transporter, models the overall deformation of the object within the entire video, so it can constrain the reconstruction correspondingly. Compared to weaker deformation models, this significantly reduces the reconstruction ambiguity and, for dynamic objects, allows Keypoint Transporter to obtain reconstructions of the quality superior or at least comparable to prior approaches while being much faster and reliant on a pre-trained monocular depth estimator network. To assess the method, we evaluate on new datasets of synthetic videos depicting dynamic humans and animals with ground-truth depth. We also show qualitative results on crowd-sourced real-world videos of pets."}

Conventional optimization-based methods usually fail to produce accurate results due to corrupted and noisy relative measurements. Recent learning-based approaches regard MRA as a regression problem, while these methods are sensitive to initialization due to the gauge freedom problem. To handle these problems, we propose a learnable iterative graph optimizer minimizing a gauge-invariant cost function with an edge rectification strategy to mitigate the effect of inaccurate measurements. Our graph optimizer iteratively refines the global camera rotations by minimizing each node's single rotation objective function. Besides, our approach iteratively rectifies relative rotations to make them more consistent with the current camera orientations and observed relative rotations. Furthermore, we employ a gated recurrent unit to improve the result by tracing the temporal information of the cost graph. Our framework is a real-time learning-to-optimize rotation averaging graph optimizer with a tiny size deployed for real-world applications.

Beyond seeking solutions for a single task, there are surging interests in transferring network design knowledge across multiple tasks. In this line of research, effectively modeling task correlations is vital yet highly neglected. Therefore, we propose Arch-Graph, a transferable NAS method that predicts task-specific optimal architectures with respect to given task embeddings. It leverages correlations across multiple tasks by using their embeddings as a part of the predictor's input for fast adaptation. We also formulate NAS as an architecture relation graph prediction problem, with the relational graph constructed by treating candidate architectures as nodes and their pairwise relations as edges. To enforce some basic properties such as acyclicity in the relational graph, we add additional constraints to the optimization process, converting NAS into the problem of finding a Maximal Weighted Acyclic Subgraph (MWAS). Our algorithm then strives to eliminate cycles and only establish edges in the graph if the rank results can be trusted. Through MWAS, Arch-Graph can effectively rank candidate models for each task with only a small budget to finetune the predictor. With extensive experiments on TransNAS-Bench-101, we show Arch-Graph's transferability and high sample efficiency across numerous tasks, beating many NAS methods designed for both single-task and multi-task search.

We consider each task independently by disentangling the importance measurement and take the unanimous decisions among all tasks when performing parameter pruning and selection. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance on various configurations and settings compared to popular sparse training and pruning methods. Besides the effectiveness in compression, DiSparse also provides a powerful tool to the multitask learning community. Surprisingly, we even observed better performance than some dedicated multitask learning methods in several cases despite the high model sparsity enforced by DiSparse. We analyzed the pruning masks generated with DiSparse and observed strikingly similar sparse network architecture identified by each task even before the training starts. We also observe the existence of a \"watershed\" layer where the task relatedness sharply drops, implying no benefits in continued parameters sharing.

To this end, we explore few-shot learning from the perspective of neural architecture, as well as a three stage pipeline of pre-training on external data, meta-training with labelled few-shot tasks, and task-specific fine-tuning on unseen tasks. We investigate questions such as: (1) How pre-training on external data benefits FSL? (2) How state of the art transformer architectures can be exploited? and (3) How to best exploit fine-tuning?

In spite of good progress, accurate and reliable 3D detection is yet to be achieved due to the sparsity and irregularity of LiDAR point clouds. Among existing strategies, multi-view methods have shown great promise by leveraging the more comprehensive information from both bird's eye view (BEV) and range view (RV). These multi-view methods either refine the proposals predicted from single view via fused features, or fuse the features without considering the global spatial context; their performance is limited consequently. In this paper, we propose to adaptively fuse multi-view features in a global spatial context via Dual Cross-VIew SpaTial Attention (VISTA). The proposed VISTA is a novel plug-and-play fusion module, wherein the multi-layer perceptron widely adopted in standard attention modules is replaced with a convolutional one. Thanks to the learned attention mechanism, VISTA can produce fused features of high quality for prediction of proposals. We decouple the classification and regression tasks in VISTA, and an additional constraint of attention variance is applied that enables the attention module to focus on specific targets instead of generic points. We conduct thorough experiments on the benchmarks of nuScenes and Waymo; results confirm the efficacy of our designs. At the time of submission, our method achieves 63.0% in overall mAP and 69.8% in NDS on the nuScenes benchmark, outperforming all published methods by up to 24% in safety-crucial categories such as cyclist."}

This has many applications in medicine and biomechanics. Existing state-of-the-art biomechanical skeletons are detailed but do not easily generalize to new subjects. Additionally, computer vision and graphics methods that predict skeletons are typically heuristic, not learned from data, do not leverage the full 3D body surface, and are not validated against ground truth. To our knowledge, our system, called OSSO (Obtaining Skeletal Shape from Outside), is the first to learn the mapping from the 3D body surface to the internal skeleton from real data. We do so using 1000 male and 1000 female dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. To these, we fit a parametric 3D body shape model (STAR) to capture the body surface and a novel part-based 3D skeleton model to capture the bones. This provides inside/outside training pairs. We model the statistical variation of full skeletons using PCA in a pose-normalized space and train a regressor from body shape parameters to skeleton shape parameters. Given an arbitrary 3D body shape and pose, OSSO predicts a realistic skeleton inside. In contrast to previous work, we evaluate the accuracy of the skeleton shape quantitatively on held out DXA scans, outperforming the state-of-the art. We also show 3D skeleton prediction from varied and challenging 3D bodies. The code to infer a skeleton from a body shape is available at https://osso.is.tue.mpg.de, and the dataset of paired outer surface (skin) and skeleton (bone) meshes is available as a Biobank Returned Dataset.

Recent works combine adversarial loss with pixel-wise loss to train a GAN-based model or introduce normalizing flows into SR problems to generate more realistic images. As another powerful generative approach, autoregressive (AR) model has not been noticed in low level tasks due to its limitation. Based on the fact that given the structural information, the textural details in the natural images are locally related without long term dependency, in this paper we propose a novel autoregressive model-based SR approach, namely LAR-SR, which can efficiently generate realistic SR images using a novel local autoregressive (LAR) module. The proposed LAR module can sample all the patches of textural components in parallel, which greatly reduces the time consumption. In addition to high time efficiency, it is also able to leverage contextual information of pixels and can be optimized with a consistent loss. Experimental results on the widely-used datasets show that the proposed LAR-SR approach achieves superior performance on the visual quality and quantitative metrics compared with other generative models such as GAN, Flow, and is competitive with the mixture generative model."}

Recent works use the attention mechanism or extra information to aggregate common co-salient features, leading to incomplete even incorrect responses for target objects. In this paper, we aim to mine comprehensive co-salient features with democracy and reduce background interference without introducing any extra information. To achieve this, we design a democratic prototype generation module to generate democratic response maps, covering sufficient co-salient regions and thereby involving more shared attributes of co-salient objects. Then a comprehensive prototype based on the response maps can be generated as a guide for final prediction. To suppress the noisy background information in the prototype, we propose a self-contrastive learning module, where both positive and negative pairs are formed without relying on additional classification information. Besides, we also design a democratic feature enhancement module to further strengthen the co-salient features by readjusting attention values. Extensive experiments show that our model obtains better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods, especially on challenging real-world cases (e.g., for CoCA, we obtain a gain of 2.0% for MAE, 5.4% for maximum F-measure, 2.3% for maximum E-measure, and 3.7% for S-measure) under the same settings.

This is precisely the goal behind few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL), where the emphasis is additionally placed on ensuring the model does not suffer from \"forgetting\". In this paper, we push the boundary further for FSCIL by addressing two key questions that bottleneck its ubiquitous application (i) can the model learn from diverse modalities other than just photo (as humans do), and (ii) what if photos are not readily accessible (due to ethical and privacy constraints). Our key innovation lies in advocating the use of sketches as a new modality for class support. The product is a \"Doodle It Yourself\" (DIY) FSCIL framework where the users can freely sketch a few examples of a novel class for the model to learn to recognise photos of that class. For that, we present a framework that infuses (i) gradient consensus for domain invariant learning, (ii) knowledge distillation for preserving old class information, and (iii) graph attention networks for message passing between old and novel classes. We experimentally show that sketches are better class support than text in the context of FSCIL, echoing findings elsewhere in the sketching literature."}

In contrast, our goal is to learn the avatar from only 2D images of people in unconstrained poses. Given a set of images, our method estimates a detailed 3D surface from each image and then combines these into an animatable avatar. Implicit functions are well suited to the first task, as they can capture details like hair or clothes. Current methods, however, are not robust to varied human poses and often produce 3D surfaces with broken or disembodied limbs, missing details, or non-human shapes. The problem is that these methods use global feature encoders that are sensitive to global pose. To address this, we propose ICON (\"Implicit Clothed humans Obtained from Normals\"), which uses local features. ICON has two main modules, both of which exploit the SMPL body model. First, ICON infers detailed clothed-human normals(front/back) conditioned on the SMPL normals. Second, a visibility-aware implicit surface regressor produces an iso-surface of the human occupancy field. Importantly, at inference time, a feedback loop alternates between refining the SMPL mesh using the inferred clothed normals and then refining the normals. Given multiple reconstructed frames of a subject in varied poses, we use modified SCANimate to produce an animatable avatar from them. Evaluation on the AGORA and CAPE datasets shows that ICON outperforms the state-of-the-art in reconstruction, even with heavily limited training data. Additionally, it is much more robust to out-of-distribution samples, e.g., in-the-wild poses/images and out-of-frame cropping. ICON takes a step towards pose-robust 3D clothed human reconstruction from in-the-wild images. This enables creating avatars directly from video with personalized and nature pose-dependent cloth deformation. Our models and code will be available for research."}

In this paper, we present a generic perception architecture named Uni-Perceiver, which processes a variety of modalities and tasks with unified modeling and shared parameters. Specifically, Uni-Perceiver encodes different task inputs and targets from arbitrary modalities into a unified representation space with a modality-agnostic Transformer encoder and lightweight modality-specific tokenizers. Different perception tasks are modeled as the same formulation, that is, finding the maximum likelihood target for each input through the similarity of their representations. The model is pre-trained on several uni-modal and multi-modal tasks, and evaluated on a variety of downstream tasks, including novel tasks that did not appear in the pre-training stage. Results show that our pre-trained model without any tuning can achieve reasonable performance even on novel tasks.

Near-perfect accuracy on benchmarks is common, but these models do not work as expected when deployed outside of the training distribution. To build computer vision systems that truly solve real-world problems at global scale, we need benchmarks that fully capture real-world complexity, including geographic domain shift, long-tailed distributions, and data noise. We propose urban forest monitoring as an ideal testbed for studying and improving upon these computer vision challenges, while simultaneously working towards filling a crucial environmental and societal need. Urban forests provide significant benefits to urban societies (e.g., cleaner air and water, carbon sequestration, and energy savings among others). However, planning and maintaining these forests is expensive. One particularly costly aspect of urban forest management is monitoring the existing trees in a city: e.g., tracking tree locations, species, and health. Monitoring efforts are currently based on tree censuses built by human experts, costing cities millions of dollars per census and thus collected infrequently. Previous investigations into automating urban forest monitoring focused on small datasets from single cities, covering only common categories. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a new large-scale dataset that joins public tree censuses from 23 cities with a large collection of street level and aerial imagery. Our Auto Arborist dataset contains over 2.5M trees and 344 genera and is >2 orders of magnitude larger than the closest dataset in the literature.

In contrast, we propose a new training scheme that removes the need for ground-truth samples, enabling self-supervised training of dynamic 3D garment deformations. Our key contribution is to realize that physics-based deformation models, traditionally solved in a frame-by-frame basis by implicit integrators, can be recasted as an optimization problem. We leverage such optimization-based scheme to formulate a set of physics-based loss terms that can be used to train neural networks without precomputing ground-truth data. This allows us to learn models for interactive garments, including dynamic deformations and fine wrinkles, with two orders of magnitude speed up in training time compared to state-of-the-art supervised methods."}

However, realistic segmentation datasets are highly imbalanced, pseudo labels are typically biased to the majority classes and basically noisy, leading to an error-prone and suboptimal model. In this paper, we propose a simple region-based active learning approach for semantic segmentation under a domain shift, aiming to automatically query a small partition of image regions to be labeled while maximizing segmentation performance. Our algorithm, Region Impurity and Prediction Uncertainty (RIPU), introduces a new acquisition strategy characterizing the spatial adjacency of image regions along with the prediction confidence. We show that the proposed region-based selection strategy makes more efficient use of a limited budget than image-based or point-based counterparts. Further, we enforce local prediction consistency between a pixel and its nearest neighbors on a source image. Alongside, we develop a negative learning loss to make the features more discriminative.

Encouraged by this insight, we propose CrossPoint, a simple cross-modal contrastive learning approach to learn transferable 3D point cloud representations. It enables a 3D-2D correspondence of objects by maximizing agreement between point clouds and the corresponding rendered 2D image in the invariant space, while encouraging invariance to transformations in the point cloud modality. Our joint training objective combines the feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus ensembles a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image modalities in a self-supervised fashion. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the previous unsupervised learning methods on a diverse range of downstream tasks including 3D object classification and segmentation. Further, the ablation studies validates the potency of our approach for a better point cloud understanding. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/MohamedAfham/CrossPoint."}

A quick pilot study reveals: (i) a scene sketch does not necessarily contain all objects in the corresponding photo, due to the subjective holistic interpretation of scenes, (ii) there exists significant empty (white) regions as a result of object-level abstraction, and as a result, (iii) existing scene-level fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval methods collapse as scene sketches become more partial. To solve this \"partial\" problem, we advocate for a simple set-based approach using optimal transport (OT) to model cross-modal region associativity in a partially-aware fashion. Importantly, we improve upon OT to further account for holistic partialness by comparing intra-modal adjacency matrices. Our proposed method is not only robust to partial scene-sketches but also yields state-of-the-art performance on existing datasets."}

To decouple the NSS from the MBS, a dynamic dictionary has been adopted in a large volume of CL frameworks, among which arguably the most popular one is MoCo family. In essence, MoCo adopts a momentum-based queue dictionary, for which we perform a fine-grained analysis of its size and consistency. We point out that InfoNCE loss used in MoCo implicitly attract anchors to their corresponding positive sample with various strength of penalties and identify such inter-anchor hardness-awareness property as a major reason for the necessity of a large dictionary. Our findings motivate us to simplify MoCo v2 via the removal of its dictionary as well as momentum. Based on an InfoNCE with the proposed dual temperature, our simplified frameworks, SimMoCo and SimCo, outperform MoCo v2 by a visible margin. Moreover, our work bridges the gap between CL and non-CL frameworks, contributing to a more unified understanding of these two mainstream frameworks in SSL.

Existing methods based on two-phase architecture design assume dependency between phases and cause color-image incongruity. To solve these problems, we propose a novel Unified Conditional image Repainting Network (UniCoRN). We break the two-phase assumption in CIR task by constructing the interaction and dependency relationship between background and other conditions. We further introduce the hierarchical structure into cross-modality similarity model to capture feature patterns at different levels and bridge the gap between visual content and color condition. A new LANDSCAPE-CIR dataset is collected and annotated to expand the application scenarios of the CIR task. Experiments show that UniCoRN achieves higher synthetic quality, better condition consistency, and more realistic compositing effect."}

One strategy to explore in SSL MIA is based on the pseudo labelling strategy, but it has a few shortcomings. Pseudo-labelling has in general lower accuracy than consistency learning, it is not specifically designed for both multi-class and multi-label problems, and it can be challenged by imbalanced learning. In this paper, unlike traditional methods that select confident pseudo label by threshold, we propose a new SSL algorithm, called anti-curriculum pseudo-labelling (ACPL), which introduces novel techniques to select informative unlabelled samples, improving training balance and allowing the model to work for both multi-label and multi-class problems, and to estimate pseudo labels by an accurate ensemble of classifiers (improving pseudo label accuracy). We run extensive experiments to evaluate ACPL on two public medical image classification benchmarks: Chest X-Ray14 for thorax disease multi-label classification and ISIC2018 for skin lesion multi-class classification.

This enables VR applications like experiencing 3D environments painted in the style of a favorite artist. Style transfer typically operates on 2D images, making stylization of a mesh challenging. When optimized over a variety of poses, stylization patterns become stretched out and inconsistent in size. On the other hand, model-based 3D style transfer methods exist that allow stylization from a sparse set of images, but they require a network at inference time. To this end, we optimize an explicit texture for the reconstructed mesh of a scene and stylize it jointly from all available input images. Our depth- and angle-aware optimization leverages surface normal and depth data of the underlying mesh to create a uniform and consistent stylization for the whole scene. Our experiments show that our method creates sharp and detailed results for the complete scene without view-dependent artifacts. Through extensive ablation studies, we show that the proposed 3D awareness enables style transfer to be applied to the 3D domain of a mesh. Our method can be used to render a stylized mesh in real-time with traditional rendering pipelines."}

Current adversarial defenders often learn to denoise the (attacked) point clouds by reconstruction, and then feed them to the classifiers as input. In contrast to the literature, we propose a family of robust structured declarative classifiers for point cloud classification, where the internal constrained optimization mechanism can effectively defend adversarial attacks through implicit gradients. Such classifiers can be formulated using a bilevel optimization framework. We further propose an effective and efficient instantiation of our approach, namely, Lattice Point Classifier (LPC), based on structured sparse coding in the permutohedral lattice and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that is end-to-end trainable. We demonstrate state-of-the-art robust point cloud classification performance on ModelNet40 and ScanNet under seven different attackers.

We model scene materials using procedural material graphs; such graphs represent photorealistic and resolution-independent materials.

Though multisensory object-centric learning has shown great potential lately, the modeling of objects in prior work is rather unrealistic. ObjectFolder 1.0 is a recent dataset that introduces 100 virtualized objects with visual, auditory, and tactile sensory data. However, the dataset is small in scale and the multisensory data is of limited quality, hampering generalization to real-world scenarios. We present ObjectFolder 2.0, a large-scale, multisensory dataset of common household objects in the form of implicit neural representations that significantly enhances ObjectFolder 1.0 in three aspects. First, our dataset is 10 times larger in the amount of objects and orders of magnitude faster in rendering time. Second, we significantly improve the multisensory rendering quality for all three modalities. Third, we show that models learned from virtual objects in our dataset successfully transfer to their real-world counterparts in three challenging tasks: object scale estimation, contact localization, and shape reconstruction.

However, monocular depth estimation remains a challenge for 360deg data, particularly for high resolutions like 2K (2048x1024) and beyond that are important for novel-view synthesis and virtual reality applications. Current CNN-based methods do not support such high resolutions due to limited GPU memory. In this work, we propose a flexible framework for monocular depth estimation from high-resolution 360deg images using tangent images. We project the 360deg input image onto a set of tangent planes that produce perspective views, which are suitable for the latest, most accurate state-of-the-art perspective monocular depth estimators. To achieve globally consistent disparity estimates, we recombine the individual depth estimates using deformable multi-scale alignment followed by gradient-domain blending. The result is a dense, high-resolution 360deg depth map with a high level of detail, also for outdoor scenes which are not supported by existing methods.

In this work, we propose MUSE-VAE, a new probabilistic modeling framework based on a cascade of Conditional VAEs, which tackles the long-term, uncertain trajectory prediction task using a coarse-to-fine multi-factor forecasting architecture. In its Macro stage, the model learns a joint pixel-space representation of two key factors, the underlying environment and the agent movements, to predict the long and short term motion goals. Conditioned on them, the Micro stage learns a fine-grained spatio-temporal representation for the prediction of individual agent trajectories. The VAE backbones across the two stages make it possible to naturally account for the joint uncertainty at both levels of granularity. As a result, MUSE-VAE offers diverse and simultaneously more accurate predictions compared to the current state-of-the-art. We demonstrate these assertions through a comprehensive set of experiments on nuScenes and SDD benchmarks as well as PFSD, a new synthetic dataset, which challenges the forecasting ability of models on complex agent-environment interaction scenarios."}

Inferring the depth of a person in an image, however, is fundamentally ambiguous without knowing their height. This is particularly problematic when the scene contains people of very different sizes, e.g. from infants to adults. To solve this, we need several things. First, we develop a novel method to infer the poses and depth of multiple people in a single image. While previous work that estimates multiple people does so by reasoning in the image plane, our method, called BEV, adds an additional imaginary Bird's-Eye-View representation to explicitly reason about depth. BEV reasons simultaneously about body centers in the image and in depth and, by combing these, estimates 3D body position. Unlike prior work, BEV is a single-shot method that is end-to-end differentiable. Second, height varies with age, making it impossible to resolve depth without also estimating the age of people in the image. To do so, we exploit a 3D body model space that lets BEV infer shapes from infants to adults. Third, to train BEV, we need a new dataset. Specifically, we create a \"Relative Human\" (RH) dataset that includes age labels and relative depth relationships between the people in the images. Extensive experiments on RH and AGORA demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and training scheme. BEV outperforms existing methods on depth reasoning, child shape estimation, and robustness to occlusion. The code and dataset are released for research purposes."}

However, many of them face scalability issues as they encode the isosurface function of a whole object or scene into a single latent vector. To overcome this limitation, a few approaches infer latent vectors on a coarse regular 3D grid or on 3D patches, and interpolate them to answer occupancy queries. In doing so, they loose the direct connection with the input points sampled on the surface of objects, and they attach information uniformly in space rather than where it matters the most, i.e., near the surface. Besides, relying on fixed patch sizes may require discretization tuning. To address these issues, we propose to use point cloud convolutions and compute latent vectors at each input point. We then perform a learning-based interpolation on nearest neighbors using inferred weights. Experiments on both object and scene datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms other methods on most classical metrics, producing finer details and better reconstructing thinner volumes.

In this paper, we argue that this prevalent proposal-based framework has three inherent drawbacks: 1) The ground-truth predicate labels for proposals are partially correct. 2) They break the high-order relations among different predicate instances of a same subject-object pair. 3) VidSGG performance is upper-bounded by the quality of the proposals. To this end, we propose a new classification-then-grounding framework for VidSGG, which can avoid all the three overlooked drawbacks. Meanwhile, under this framework, we reformulate the video scene graphs as temporal bipartite graphs, where the entities and predicates are two types of nodes with time slots, and the edges denote different semantic roles between these nodes. This formulation takes full advantage of our new framework. Accordingly, we further propose a novel BIpartite Graph based SGG model: BIG. It consists of a classification stage and a grounding stage, where the former aims to classify the categories of all the nodes and the edges, and the latter tries to localize the temporal location of each relation instance. Extensive ablations on two VidSGG datasets have attested to the effectiveness of our framework and BIG. Code is available at https://github.com/Dawn-LX/VidSGG-BIG."}

In this paper, we propose the first one-stage end-to-end gaze estimation method, GazeOnce, which is capable of simultaneously predicting gaze directions for multiple faces (>10) in an image. In addition, we design a sophisticated data generation pipeline and propose a new dataset, MPSGaze, which contains full images of multiple people with 3D gaze ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only offers a faster speed, but also provides a lower gaze estimation error compared with state-of-the-art methods.

A major challenge is that the model does not have access to the future and has to solely rely on the history, i.e., the frames observed so far, to make predictions. It is therefore important to accentuate parts of the history that are more informative to the prediction of the current frame. We present GateHUB, Gated History Unit with Background Suppression, that comprises a novel position-guided gated cross-attention mechanism to enhance or suppress parts of the history as per how informative they are for current frame prediction. GateHUB further proposes Future-augmented History (FaH) to make history features more informative by using subsequently observed frames when available. In a single unified framework, GateHUB integrates the transformer's ability of long-range temporal modeling and the recurrent model's capacity to selectively encode relevant information. GateHUB also introduces a background suppression objective to further mitigate false positive background frames that closely resemble the action frames. Extensive validation on three benchmark datasets, THUMOS, TVSeries, and HDD, demonstrates that GateHUB significantly outperforms all existing methods and is also more efficient than the existing best work. Furthermore, a flow-free version of GateHUB is able to achieve higher or close accuracy at 2.8x higher frame rate compared to all existing methods that require both RGB and optical flow information for prediction."}

Existing text-to-image Generative Adversarial Networks generally employ a stacked architecture as the backbone yet still remain three flaws. First, the stacked architecture introduces the entanglements between generators of different image scales. Second, existing studies prefer to apply and fix extra networks in adversarial learning for text-image semantic consistency, which limits the supervision capability of these networks. Third, the cross-modal attention-based text-image fusion that widely adopted by previous works is limited on several special image scales because of the computational cost. To these ends, we propose a simpler but more effective Deep Fusion Generative Adversarial Networks (DF-GAN). To be specific, we propose: (i) a novel one-stage text-to-image backbone that directly synthesizes high-resolution images without entanglements between different generators, (ii) a novel Target-Aware Discriminator composed of Matching-Aware Gradient Penalty and One-Way Output, which enhances the text-image semantic consistency without introducing extra networks, (iii) a novel deep text-image fusion block, which deepens the fusion process to make a full fusion between text and visual features.

In contrast, classical approaches to structure from motion estimate 3D motion utilizing optical flow and then compute depth. Their accuracy, however, depends strongly on the quality of the optical flow. To avoid this issue, direct methods have been proposed, which separate 3D motion from depth estimation but compute 3D motion using only image gradients in the form of normal flow. In this paper, we introduce a network NFlowNet, for normal flow estimation which is used to enforce robust and direct constraints. In particular, normal flow is used to estimate relative camera pose based on the cheirality (depth positivity) constraint. We achieve this by formulating the optimization problem as a differentiable cheirality layer, which allows for end-to-end learning of camera pose. We perform extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed DiffPoseNet's sensitivity to noise and its generalization across datasets.

Our method uses two decoupled latent codes to generate corresponding facial semantics and texture in a spatial-aligned 3D volume with shared geometry. Benefiting from such underlying 3D representation, FENeRF can jointly render the boundary-aligned image and semantic mask and use the semantic mask to edit the 3D volume via GAN inversion. We further show such 3D representation can be learned from widely available monocular image and semantic mask pairs.

We apply our method to various scenes with different types of controllable attributes (e.g. expression control on human faces, or state control in the movement of inanimate objects).

Early attempts that propose simple models, such as signal-independent additive white Gaussian noise or the heteroscedastic Gaussian noise model (a.k.a., camera noise level function) are not sufficient to learn the complex behavior of the camera sensor noise. Recently, more complex learning-based models have been proposed that yield better results in noise synthesis and downstream tasks, such as denoising. However, their dependence on supervised data (i.e., paired clean images) is a limiting factor given the challenges in producing ground-truth images. This paper proposes a framework for training a noise model and a denoiser simultaneously while relying only on pairs of noisy images rather than noisy/clean paired image data. We apply this framework to the training of the Noise Flow architecture. The noise synthesis and density estimation results show that our framework outperforms previous signal-processing-based noise models and is on par with its supervised counterpart. The trained denoiser is also shown to significantly improve upon both supervised and weakly supervised baseline denoising approaches. The results indicate that the joint training of a denoiser and a noise model yields significant improvements in the denoiser."}

However, in this way, the model parameters come from all seen instances, which means a huge amount of irrelevant seen instances might also involve in predicting the current situation, disturbing the performance. To provide a more explicit link between the current situation and the seen instances, we imitate the mechanism of retrospective memory in neuropsychology and propose MemoNet, an instance-based approach that predicts the movement intentions of agents by looking for similar scenarios in the training data. In MemoNet, we design a pair of memory banks to explicitly store representative instances in the training set, acting as prefrontal cortex in the neural system, and a trainable memory addresser to adaptively search a current situation with similar instances in the memory bank, acting like basal ganglia. During prediction, MemoNet recalls previous memory by using the memory addresser to index related instances in the memory bank. We further propose a two-step trajectory prediction system, where the first step is to leverage MemoNet to predict the destination and the second step is to fulfill the whole trajectory according to the predicted destinations. Experiments show that the proposed MemoNet improves the FDE by 20.3%/10.2%/28.3% from the previous best method on SDD/ETH-UCY/NBA datasets. Experiments also show that our MemoNet has the ability to trace back to specific instances during prediction, promoting more interpretability."}

In this work, we study the robustness of VQA models from a novel perspective: visual context. We suggest that the models over-rely on the visual context, i.e., irrelevant objects in the image, to make predictions. To diagnose the models' reliance on visual context and measure their robustness, we propose a simple yet effective perturbation technique, SwapMix. SwapMix perturbs the visual context by swapping features of irrelevant context objects with features from other objects in the dataset. Using SwapMix we are able to change answers to more than 45% of the questions for a representative VQA model. Additionally, we train the models with perfect sight and find that the context over-reliance highly depends on the quality of visual representations. In addition to diagnosing, SwapMix can also be applied as a data augmentation strategy during training in order to regularize the context over-reliance. By swapping the context object features, the model reliance on context can be suppressed effectively. Two representative VQA models are studied using SwapMix: a co-attention model MCAN and a large-scale pretrained model LXMERT. Our experiments on the popular GQA dataset show the effectiveness of SwapMix for both diagnosing model robustness, and regularizing the over-reliance on visual context."}

With the same network architecture and only dictated by the input domain pairs, our model can learn both style-preserving content alteration and content-preserving style transfer. We demonstrate the generality and quality of the translation results, and compare them to well-known baselines. Code is available at https://qiminchen.github.io/unist/."}

Although attributes such as camera and background scene motion inherently change the difficulty of the task and affect methods differently, existing evaluation schemes fail to control for them, thereby providing minimal insight into inpainting failure modes. To address this gap, we propose the Diagnostic Evaluation of Video Inpainting on Landscapes (DEVIL) benchmark, which consists of two contributions: (i) a novel dataset of videos and masks labeled according to several key inpainting failure modes, and (ii) an evaluation scheme that samples slices of the dataset characterized by a fixed content attribute, and scores performance on each slice according to reconstruction, realism, and temporal consistency quality. By revealing systematic changes in performance induced by particular characteristics of the input content, our challenging benchmark enables more insightful analysis into video inpainting methods and serves as an invaluable diagnostic tool for the field.

Existing methods use pre-trained query-agnostic visual backbones to extract visual feature maps independently without considering the query information. We argue that the visual features extracted from the visual backbones and the features really needed for multimodal reasoning are inconsistent. One reason is that there are differences between pre-training tasks and visual grounding. Moreover, since the backbones are query-agnostic, it is difficult to completely avoid the inconsistency issue by training the visual backbone end-to-end in the visual grounding framework. In this paper, we propose a Query-modulated Refinement Network (QRNet) to address the inconsistent issue by adjusting intermediate features in the visual backbone with a novel Query-aware Dynamic Attention (QD-ATT) mechanism and query-aware multiscale fusion. The QD-ATT can dynamically compute query-dependent visual attention at the spatial and channel level of the feature maps produced by the visual backbone. We apply the QRNet to an end-to-end visual grounding framework. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five widely used datasets."}

In this paper, we propose FLOAT, a factorized label space framework for scalable multi-object multi-part parsing. Our framework involves independent dense prediction of object category and part attributes which increases scalability and reduces task complexity compared to the monolithic label space counterpart. In addition, we propose an inference-time 'zoom' refinement technique which significantly improves segmentation quality, especially for smaller objects/parts. Compared to state of the art, FLOAT obtains an absolute improvement of 2.0% for mean IOU (mIOU) and 4.8% for segmentation quality IOU (sqIOU) on the Pascal-Part-58 dataset. For the larger Pascal-Part-108 dataset, the improvements are 2.1% for mIOU and 3.9% for sqIOU. We incorporate previously excluded part attributes and other minor parts of the Pascal-Part dataset to create the most comprehensive and challenging version which we dub Pascal-Part-201.

GAN is essentially a two-player zero-sum game between the generator and the discriminator. Training GANs is challenging as a pure Nash equilibrium may not exist and even finding the mixed Nash equilibrium is difficult as GANs have a large-scale strategy space. In DO-GAN, we extend the double oracle framework to GANs. We first generalize the players' strategies as the trained models of generator and discriminator from the best response oracles. We then compute the meta-strategies using a linear program. For scalability of the framework where multiple generators and discriminator best responses are stored in the memory, we propose two solutions: 1) pruning the weakly-dominated players' strategies to keep the oracles from becoming intractable; 2) applying continual learning to retain the previous knowledge of the networks. We apply our framework to established GAN architectures such as vanilla GAN, Deep Convolutional GAN, Spectral Normalization GAN and Stacked GAN. Finally, we conduct experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets and show that DO-GAN variants have significant improvements in both subjective qualitative evaluation and quantitative metrics, compared with their respective GAN architectures."}

In this paper, we demonstrate photorealistic video under starlight (no moon present, <0.001 lux) for the first time. To enable this, we develop a GAN-tuned physics-based noise model to more accurately represent camera noise at the lowest light levels. Using this noise model, we train a video denoiser using a combination of simulated noisy video clips and real noisy still images. We capture a 5-10 fps video dataset with significant motion at approximately 0.6-0.7 millilux with no active illumination. Comparing against alternative methods, we achieve improved video quality at the lowest light levels, demonstrating photorealistic video denoising in starlight for the first time."}

To obtain a high-precision binary segmentation mask, users tend to add interaction clicks around the object details, such as edges and holes, for efficient refinement. Current methods regard these repair clicks as the guidance to jointly determine the global prediction. However, the global view makes the model lose focus from later clicks, and is not in line with user intentions. In this paper, we dive into the view of clicks' eyes to endow them with the decisive role in object details again. To verify the necessity of focus view, we design a simple yet effective pipeline, named FocusCut, which integrates the functions of object segmentation and local refinement. After obtaining the global prediction, it crops click-centered patches from the original image with adaptive scopes to refine the local predictions progressively. Without user perception and parameters increase, our method has achieved state-of-the-art results. Extensive experiments and visualized results demonstrate that FocusCut makes hyper-fine segmentation possible for interactive image segmentation."}

Existing approaches for mitigating privacy leakage in action recognition require privacy labels along with the action labels from the video dataset. However, annotating frames of video dataset for privacy labels is not feasible. Recent developments of self-supervised learning (SSL) have unleashed the untapped potential of the unlabeled data. For the first time, we present a novel training framework which removes privacy information from input video in a self-supervised manner without requiring privacy labels. Our training framework consists of three main components: anonymization function, self-supervised privacy removal branch, and action recognition branch. We train our framework using a minimax optimization strategy to minimize the action recognition cost function and maximize the privacy cost function through a contrastive self-supervised loss. Employing existing protocols of known-action and privacy attributes, our framework achieves a competitive action-privacy trade-off to the existing state-of-the-art supervised methods. In addition, we introduce a new protocol to evaluate the generalization of learned the anonymization function to novel-action and privacy attributes and show that our self-supervised framework outperforms existing supervised methods.

State-of-the-art approaches typically use different backbones to extract features for RGB and depth images. They use a 2D CNN for RGB images and a per-pixel point cloud network for depth data, as well as a fusion network for feature fusion. We find that the essential reason for using two independent backbones is the \"projection breakdown\" problem. In the depth image plane, the projected 3D structure of the physical world is preserved by the 1D depth value and its built-in 2D pixel coordinate (UV). Any spatial transformation that modifies UV, such as resize, flip, crop, or pooling operations in the CNN pipeline, breaks the binding between the pixel value and UV coordinate. As a consequence, the 3D structure is no longer preserved by a modified depth image or feature. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method denoted as Uni6D that explicitly takes the extra UV data along with RGB-D images as input. Our method has a Unified CNN framework for 6D pose estimation with a single CNN backbone. In particular, the architecture of our method is based on Mask R-CNN with two extra heads, one named RT head for directly predicting 6D pose and the other named abc head for guiding the network to map the visible points to their coordinates in the 3D model as an auxiliary module. This end-to-end approach balances simplicity and accuracy, achieving comparable accuracy with state of the arts and 7.2x faster inference speed on the YCB-Video dataset."}

Recently, neural implicit 3D representations have shown great expressibility in capturing 3D shape geometry. We observe that deformable object motion is often semantically structured, and thus propose to learn Structured-implicit PArametric Models (SPAMs) as a deformable object representation that structurally decomposes non-rigid object motion into part-based disentangled representations of shape and pose, with each being represented by deep implicit functions. This enables a structured characterization of object movement, with part decomposition characterizing a lower-dimensional space in which we can establish coarse motion correspondence. In particular, we can leverage the part decompositions at test time to fit to new depth sequences of unobserved shapes, by establishing part correspondences between the input observation and our learned part spaces; this guides a robust joint optimization between the shape and pose of all parts, even under dramatic motion sequences. Experiments demonstrate that our part-aware shape and pose understanding lead to state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction and tracking of depth sequences of complex deforming object motion."}

In order to calculate the auxiliary loss between the feature maps of intermediate layers and the ground truth in the field of semantic segmentation, the size of each feature map must match the ground truth. In all studies using the auxiliary losses with the segmentation models, from what we have investigated, they either use a down-sampling function to reduce the size of the ground truth or use an up-sampling function to increase the size of the feature map in order to match the resolution between the feature map and the ground truth. However, in the process of selecting representative values through down-sampling and up-sampling, information loss is inevitable. In this paper, we introduce Class Probability Preserving (CPP) pooling to alleviate information loss in down-sampling the ground truth in semantic segmentation tasks. We demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method on Cityscapes, Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, and NYU-Depth-v2 datasets by using CPP pooling with auxiliary losses based on seven popular segmentation models. In addition, we propose See-Through Network (SeeThroughNet) that adopts an improved multi-scale attention-coupled decoder structure to maximize the effect of CPP pooling. SeeThroughNet shows cutting-edge results in the field of semantic understanding of urban street scenes, which ranked #1 on the Cityscapes benchmark."}

Finding good representations depends on the nature of supervision and the learning algorithm. We propose a novel algorithm that utilizes a weak form of supervision where the data is partitioned into sets according to certain inactive (common) factors of variation which are invariant across elements of each set. Our key insight is that by seeking correspondence between elements of different sets, we learn strong representations that exclude the inactive factors of variation and isolate the active factors that vary within all sets. As a consequence of focusing on the active factors, our method can leverage a mix of set-supervised and wholly unsupervised data, which can even belong to a different domain. We tackle the challenging problem of synthetic-to-real object pose transfer, without pose annotations on anything, by isolating pose information which generalizes to the category level and across the synthetic/real domain gap. The method can also boost performance in supervised settings, by strengthening intermediate representations, as well as operate in practically attainable scenarios with set-supervised natural images, where quantity is limited and nuisance factors of variation are more plentiful."}

We implement DETReg using the DETR family of detectors and show that it improves over competitive baselines when finetuned on COCO, PASCAL VOC, and Airbus Ship benchmarks. In low-data regimes, including semi-supervised and few-shot learning settings, DETReg establishes many state-of-the-art results, e.g., on COCO we see a +6.0 AP improvement for 10-shot detection and +3.5 AP improvement when training with only 1% of the labels."}

For detecting actions in those complex videos, efficiently capturing both short-term and long-term temporal information in the video is critical. To this end, we propose a novel ConvTransformer network for action detection.

(2) Temporal Scale Mixer module effectively fuses the multi-scale features to have a unified feature representation. (3) Classification module is used to learn the instance center-relative position and predict the frame-level classification scores.

Although maintaining a handful of samples (called \"exemplars\") of each task could alleviate forgetting to some extent, existing methods are still limited by the small number of exemplars since these exemplars are too few to carry enough task-specific knowledge, and therefore the forgetting remains. To overcome this problem, we propose to \"imagine\" diverse counterparts of given exemplars referring to the abundant semantic-irrelevant information from unlabeled data. Specifically, we develop a learnable feature generator to diversify exemplars by adaptively generating diverse counterparts of exemplars based on semantic information from exemplars and semantically-irrelevant information from unlabeled data. We introduce semantic contrastive learning to enforce the generated samples to be semantic consistent with exemplars and perform semanticdecoupling contrastive learning to encourage diversity of generated samples. The diverse generated samples could effectively prevent DNN from forgetting when learning new tasks. Our method does not bring any extra inference cost and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two benchmarks CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-Subset by a clear margin."}

Here, an MBODF is referred to as a solution that has many execution branches and one can dynamically choose from among them at inference time to satisfy varying latency requirements (e.g. by varying resolution of an input frame). In this paper, we ask, and answer, the wide-ranging question across all MBODFs: How to expose the right set of execution branches and then how to schedule the optimal one at inference time? In addition, we uncover the importance of making a content-aware decision on which branch to run, as the optimal one is conditioned on the video content. Finally, we explore a content-aware scheduler, an Oracle one, and then a practical one, leveraging various lightweight feature extractors. Our evaluation shows that layered on Faster R-CNN-based MBODF, compared to 7 baselines, our SMARTADAPT achieves a higher Pareto optimal curve in the accuracy-vs-latency space for the ILSVRC VID dataset."}

However, fine-tuning the entire parameter set of pre-trained models becomes impractical since the model size is growing rapidly. Hence, in this paper, we introduce adapter-based parameter-efficient transfer learning techniques to V&L models such as VL-BART and VL-T5. We evaluate our methods in a unified multi-task setup on both image-text and video-text benchmarks. For the image-text tasks, we use four diverse V&L datasets: VQAv2, GQA, NLVR2, and MSCOCO image captioning. For video-text tasks, we use TVQA, How2QA, TVC, and YC2C. With careful training and thorough experiments, we benchmark three popular adapter-based methods (Adapter, Hyperformer, Compacter) against the standard full fine-tuning and the recently proposed prompt-tuning approach. We also enhance the efficiency and performance of adapters by sharing their weights to attain knowledge across tasks. Our results demonstrate that training the adapter with the weight-sharing technique (4.18% of total parameters for image-text tasks and 3.39% for video-text tasks) can match the performance of fine-tuning the entire model.

However, current dynamic methods rely on learning a continuous channel gating through regularization by inducing sparsity loss. This formulation introduces complexity in balancing different losses (e.g task loss, regularization loss). In addition, regularization based methods lack transparent tradeoff hyperparameter selection to realize computational budget. Our contribution is two-fold: 1) decoupled task and pruning training. 2) Simple hyperparameter selection that enables FLOPs reduction estimation before training. Inspired by the Hebbian theory in Neuroscience: \"neurons that fire together wire together\", we propose to predict a mask to process k filters in a layer based on the activation of its previous layer. We pose the problem as a self-supervised binary classification problem. Each mask predictor module is trained to predict if the log-likelihood for each filter in the current layer belongs to the top-k activated filters. The value k is dynamically estimated for each input based on a novel criterion using the mass of heatmaps. We show experiments on several neural architectures, such as VGG, ResNet and MobileNet on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. On CIFAR, we reach similar accuracy to SOTA methods with 15% and 24% higher FLOPs reduction. Similarly in ImageNet, we achieve lower drop in accuracy with up to 13% improvement in FLOPs reduction."}

However, due to a tremendous amount of parameters, state-of-the-art GANs usually suffer from low efficiency and bulky memory usage. To tackle this challenge, firstly, this paper investigates GANs performance from a frequency perspective. The results show that GANs, especially small GANs lack the ability to generate high-quality high frequency information. To address this problem, we propose a novel knowledge distillation method referred to as wavelet knowledge distillation. Instead of directly distilling the generated images of teachers, wavelet knowledge distillation first decomposes the images into different frequency bands with discrete wavelet transformation and then only distills the high frequency bands. As a result, the student GAN can pay more attention to its learning on high frequency bands. Experiments demonstrate that our method leads to 7.08X compression and 6.80X acceleration on CycleGAN with almost no performance drop. Additionally, we have studied the relation between discriminators and generators which shows that the compression of discriminators can promote the performance of compressed generators."}

However, annotating masks for supervised training is expensive. Weakly-supervised and unsupervised methods exist, but they depend on the comparison of pairs of images, such as from multi-views, frames of videos, and image augmentation, which limits their applicability. To address this, we propose a GAN-based approach that generates images conditioned on latent masks, thereby alleviating full or weak annotations required in previous approaches. We show that such mask-conditioned image generation can be learned faithfully when conditioning the masks in a hierarchical manner on latent keypoints that define the position of parts explicitly. Without requiring supervision of masks or points, this strategy increases robustness to viewpoint and object positions changes. It also lets us generate image-mask pairs for training a segmentation network, which outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods on established benchmarks."}

To enable maneuverable control in line with user intentions, a novel video generation task, named Text-Image-to-Video generation (TI2V), is proposed. With both controllable appearance and motion, TI2V aims at generating videos from a static image and a text description. The key challenges of TI2V task lie both in aligning appearance and motion from different modalities, and in handling uncertainty in text descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose a Motion Anchor-based video GEnerator (MAGE) with an innovative motion anchor (MA) structure to store appearance-motion aligned representation. To model the uncertainty and increase the diversity, it further allows the injection of explicit condition and implicit randomness. Through three-dimensional axial transformers, MA is interacted with given image to generate next frames recursively with satisfying controllability and diversity.

We reveal that the real culprit lies in the extremely imbalanced distribution of the classifier's weight norm. For conventional softmax cross-entropy loss, such imbalanced weight norm distribution yields ill conditioned decision boundary for categories which have small weight norms. To get rid of this situation, we choose to maximize the cosine similarity between the learned feature and the weight vector of target category rather than the inner-product of them. The decision boundary between any two categories is the angular bisector of their weight vectors. Whereas, the absolutely equal decision boundary is suboptimal because it reduces the model's sensitivity to various categories. Intuitively, categories with rich data diversity should occupy a larger area in the classification space while categories with limited data diversity should occupy a slightly small space. Hence, we devise a Category-Aware Angular Margin Loss (C2AM Loss) to introduce an adaptive angular margin between any two categories. Specifically, the margin between two categories is proportional to the ratio of their classifiers' weight norms. As a result, the decision boundary is slightly pushed towards the category which has a smaller weight norm. We conduct comprehensive experiments on LVIS dataset. C2AM Loss brings 4.9 5.2 AP improvements on different detectors and backbones compared with baseline."}

Therefore, Neural Points contain more shape information and thus have a stronger representation ability. Neural Points is trained with surface containing rich geometric details, such that the trained model has enough expression ability for various shapes. Specifically, we extract deep local features on the points and construct neural fields through the local isomorphism between the 2D parametric domain and the 3D local patch.

Our method also presents a novel localization-aware pre-training framework, where objects can be discovered from complicated scenes in an unsupervised manner. FreeSOLO achieves 9.8% AP50 on the challenging COCO dataset, which even outperforms several segmentation proposal methods that use manual annotations. For the first time, we demonstrate unsupervised class-agnostic instance segmentation successfully. FreeSOLO's box localization significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised object detection/discovery methods, with about 100% relative improvements in COCO AP. FreeSOLO further demonstrates superiority as a strong pre-training method, outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised pre-training methods by +9.8% AP when fine-tuning instance segmentation with only 5% COCO masks."}

In this context, we propose a new method for learning semantic segmentation models robust against fog. Its key idea is to consider the fog condition of an image as its style and close the gap between images with different fog conditions in neural style spaces of a segmentation model. In particular, since the neural style of an image is in general affected by other factors as well as fog, we introduce a fog-pass filter module that learns to extract a fog-relevant factor from the style. Optimizing the fog-pass filter and the segmentation model alternately gradually closes the style gap between different fog conditions and allows to learn fog-invariant features in consequence. Our method substantially outperforms previous work on three real foggy image datasets. Moreover, it improves performance on both foggy and clear weather images, while existing methods often degrade performance on clear scenes."}

However, they require a large model size and an enormous amount of computations to achieve high performance, which makes it difficult to deploy mobile applications that are limited by tight hardware resources. In this paper, we present a Lightweight modulated detector, Lite-MDETR, to facilitate efficient end-to-end multi-modal understanding on mobile devices. The key primitive is that Dictionary-Lookup-Transformormations (DLT) is proposed to replace Linear Transformation (LT) in multi-modal detectors where each weight in Linear Transformation (LT) is approximately factorized into a smaller dictionary, index, and coefficient. This way, the enormous linear projection with weights is converted into lite linear projection with dictionaries, a few lookups and scalings with indices and coefficients. DLT can be directly applied to pre-trained detectors, removing the need to perform expensive training from scratch. To tackle the challenging training of DLT due to the non-differentiable index, we convert the index and coefficient into a sparse matrix, train this sparse matrix during the fine-tuning phase, and recover it back to index and coefficient during the inference phase. Extensive experiments on several tasks such as phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension and segmentation show that our Lite-MDETR achieves similar detection accuracy to the prior multi-modal detectors with ~ 4.1xmodel size reduction."}

In this work, we introduce Coordinate GAN (CoordGAN), a structure-texture disentangled GAN that learns a dense correspondence map for each generated image. We represent the correspondence maps of different images as warped coordinate frames transformed from a canonical coordinate frame, i.e., the correspondence map, which describes the structure (e.g., the shape of a face), is controlled via a transformation. Hence, finding correspondences boils down to locating the same coordinate in different correspondence maps. In CoordGAN, we sample a transformation to represent the structure of a synthesized instance, while an independent texture branch is responsible for rendering appearance details orthogonal to the structure. Our approach can also extract dense correspondence maps for real images by adding an encoder on top of the generator. We quantitatively demonstrate the quality of the learned dense correspondences through segmentation mask transfer on multiple datasets. We also show that the proposed generator achieves better structure and texture disentanglement compared to existing approaches."}

The stereo-view SP^2 transformer is used to implicitly infer correspondences between views, and can handle noisy poses. The pose-aware CP^2layer is designed to render features from the adjacent view to the anchor (reference) view, in order to perform view fusion and estimate the visible layout. Our experiments and analysis validate our method, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art layout estimators, especially for large and complex room spaces."}

Some existing methods leverage depth information from an off-the-shelf depth estimator to assist 3D detection, but suffer from the additional computational burden and achieve limited performance caused by inaccurate depth priors. To alleviate this, we propose MonoDTR, a novel end-to-end depth-aware transformer network for monocular 3D object detection. It mainly consists of two components: (1) the Depth-Aware Feature Enhancement (DFE) module that implicitly learns depth-aware features with auxiliary supervision without requiring extra computation, and (2) the Depth-Aware Transformer (DTR) module that globally integrates context- and depth-aware features. Moreover, different from conventional pixel-wise positional encodings, we introduce a novel depth positional encoding (DPE) to inject depth positional hints into transformers. Our proposed depth-aware modules can be easily plugged into existing image-only monocular 3D object detectors to improve the performance. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art monocular-based methods and achieves real-time detection.

In this paper, we seek to temporally localize object states (e.g. \"empty\" and \"full\" cup) together with the corresponding state-modifying actions (\"pouring coffee\") in long uncurated videos with minimal supervision. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we develop a self-supervised model for jointly learning state-modifying actions together with the corresponding object states from an uncurated set of videos from the Internet. The model is self-supervised by the causal ordering signal, i.e. initial object state -> manipulating action -> end state. Second, to cope with noisy uncurated training data, our model incorporates a noise adaptive weighting module supervised by a small number of annotated still images, that allows to efficiently filter out irrelevant videos during training. Third, we collect a new dataset with more than 2600 hours of video and 34 thousand changes of object states, and manually annotate a part of this data to validate our approach. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over prior work in both action and object state-recognition in video."}

In this work, we introduce a strong semantic image matching learner, dubbed TransforMatcher, which builds on the success of transformer networks in vision domains. Unlike existing convolution- or attention-based schemes for correspondence, TransforMatcher performs global match-to-match attention for precise match localization and dynamic refinement. To handle a large number of matches in a dense correlation map, we develop a light-weight attention architecture to consider the global match-to-match interactions. We also propose to utilize a multi-channel correlation map for refinement, treating the multi-level scores as features instead of a single score to fully exploit the richer layer-wise semantics. In experiments, TransforMatcher sets a new state of the art on SPair-71k while performing on par with existing SOTA methods on the PF-PASCAL dataset."}

To this end, a model makes use of a base set to learn basic semantic discriminability that can be transferred to recognize novel classes. Most existing works handle the base and novel sets using separate objectives within a two-stage training paradigm. Despite showing competitive performance on novel classes, they fail to generalize to recognizing samples from both base and novel sets. In this paper, we focus on this generalized setting of NCD (GNCD), and propose to divide and conquer it with two groups of Compositional Experts (ComEx). Each group of experts is designed to characterize the whole dataset in a comprehensive yet complementary fashion. With their union, we can solve GNCD in an efficient end-to-end manner. We further look into the drawback in current NCD methods, and propose to strengthen ComEx with global-to-local and local-to-local regularization. ComEx is evaluated on four popular benchmarks, showing clear superiority towards the goal of GNCD."}

In existing works, it is common to use a shared backbone to extract features for both things (countable classes such as vehicles) and stuff (uncountable classes such as roads). This, however, fails to capture the rich relations among them, which can be utilized to enhance visual understanding and segmentation performance. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel Panoptic, Instance, and Semantic Relations (PISR) module to exploit such contexts. First, we generate panoptic encodings to summarize key features of the semantic classes and predicted instances. A Panoptic Relational Attention (PRA) module is then applied to the encodings and the global feature map from the backbone. It produces a feature map that captures 1) the relations across semantic classes and instances and 2) the relations between these panoptic categories and spatial features. PISR also automatically learns to focus on the more important instances, making it robust to the number of instances used in the relational attention module. Moreover, PISR is a general module that can be applied to any existing panoptic segmentation architecture. Through extensive evaluations on panoptic segmentation benchmarks like Cityscapes, COCO, and ADE20K, we show that PISR attains considerable improvements over existing approaches."}

In contrast to previous methods that normally predict attributes of 3D objects all at once, we expressively model the interdependencies between attributes of 3D objects, which in turn enables a better detection accuracy. Specifically, we view each 3D object as a sequence of words and reformulate the 3D object detection task as decoding words from 3D scenes in an auto-regressive manner. We further propose a lightweight scene-to-sequence decoder that can auto-regressively generate words conditioned on features from a 3D scene as well as cues from the preceding words. The predicted words eventually constitute a set of sequences that completely describe the 3D objects in the scene, and all the predicted sequences are then automatically assigned to the respective ground truths through similarity-based sequence matching. Our approach is conceptually intuitive and can be readily plugged upon most existing 3D-detection backbones without adding too much computational overhead; the sequential decoding paradigm we proposed, on the other hand, can better exploit information from complex 3D scenes with the aid of preceding predicted words. Without bells and whistles, our method significantly outperforms the previous anchor- and center-based 3D object detection frameworks, yielding the new state-of-the-art on the challenging ONCE dataset as well as the Waymo Open Dataset. Code will be made publicly available."}

Existing generators suffer from poor visual grounding, causing them to rely on language priors and hallucinate objects. Our MARKY-MT5 system addresses this by focusing on visual landmarks; it comprises a first stage landmark detector and a second stage generator--a multimodal, multilingual, multitask encoder-decoder. To train it, we bootstrap grounded landmark annotations on top of the Room-across-Room (RxR) dataset. Using text parsers, weak supervision from RxR's pose traces, and a multilingual image-text encoder trained on 1.8b images, we identify 1.1m English, Hindi and Telugu landmark descriptions and ground them to specific regions in panoramas. On Room-to-Room, human wayfinders obtain success rates (SR) of 73% following MARKY-MT5's instructions, just shy of their 76% SR following human instructions---and well above SRs with other generators. Evaluations on RxR's longer, diverse paths obtain 62-64% SRs on three languages. Generating such high-quality navigation instructions in novel environments is a step towards conversational navigation tools and could facilitate larger-scale training of instruction-following agents."}

The core idea is extracting the most principal contextual information is critical for detection while the target is incomplete or featureless. We find that relations between proposals provide a good representation to describe the context. However, adopting relations between all the object or patch proposals for detection is inefficient, and an imbalanced combination of local and global relations brings extra noise that could mislead the training. Rather than working with all relations, we find that training with relations only between the most representative ones, or anchors, can significantly boost the detection performance. Good anchors should be semantic-aware with no ambiguity and able to describe the whole layout of a scene with no redundancy. To find the anchors, we first perform a preliminary relation anchor module with an objectness-aware sampling approach and then devise a displacement based module for weighing the relation importance for better utilization of contextual information. This light-weight relation module leads to significantly higher accuracy of object instance detection when being plugged into the state-of- the-art detectors. Evaluations on the public benchmarks of real-world scenes show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both SUN RGB-D and ScanNet V2.

Previous methods either rely on manual visual checking or RGB image-based inspection algorithm, requiring costly preparation procedures (e.g., open the bag and spread the waste items). Moreover, occluded items are very likely to be left out. Inspired by the fact that X-ray has a strong penetrating power to see through the bag and overlapping objects, we propose to perform waste inspection efficiently using X-ray images without the need to open the bag. We introduce a novel problem of instance-level waste segmentation in X-ray image for intelligent waste inspection, and contribute a real dataset consisting of 5,038 X-ray images (totally 30,881 waste items) with high-quality annotations (i.e., waste categories, object boxes, and instance-level masks) as a benchmark for this problem. As existing segmentation methods are mainly designed for natural images and cannot take advantage of the characteristics of X-ray waste images (e.g., heavy occlusions and penetration effect), we propose a new instance segmentation method to explicitly take these image characteristics into account. Specifically, our method adopts an easy-to-hard disassembling strategy to use high confidence predictions to guide the segmentation of highly overlapped objects, and a global structure guidance module to better capture the complex contour information caused by the penetration effect. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our dataset is released at WIXRayNet."}

First, we combine local-window self-attention with depth-wise convolution in a parallel design, modeling cross-window connections to enlarge the receptive fields. Second, we propose bi-directional interactions across branches to provide complementary clues in the channel and spatial dimensions. These two designs are integrated to achieve efficient feature mixing among windows and dimensions.

However, the memory and computing cost of the Fully Connected (FC) layer linearly scales up to the number of identities in the training set. Besides, the large-scale training data inevitably suffers from inter-class conflict and long-tailed distribution. In this paper, we propose a sparsely updating variant of the FC layer, named Partial FC (PFC). In each iteration, positive class centers and a random subset of negative class centers are selected to compute the margin-based softmax loss. All class centers are still maintained throughout the whole training process, but only a subset is selected and updated in each iteration. Therefore, the computing requirement, the probability of inter-class conflict, and the frequency of passive update on tail class centers, are dramatically reduced. Extensive experiments across different training data and backbones (e.g. CNN and ViT) confirm the effectiveness, robustness and efficiency of the proposed PFC."}

However, current NeRF-based methods cannot enable users to perform user-controlled shape deformation in the scene. While existing works have proposed some approaches to modify the radiance field according to the user's constraints, the modification is limited to color editing or object translation and rotation. In this paper, we propose a method that allows users to perform controllable shape deformation on the implicit representation of the scene, and synthesizes the novel view images of the edited scene without re-training the network. Specifically, we establish a correspondence between the extracted explicit mesh representation and the implicit neural representation of the target scene. Users can first utilize well-developed mesh-based deformation methods to deform the mesh representation of the scene. Our method then utilizes user edits from the mesh representation to bend the camera rays by introducing a tetrahedra mesh as a proxy, obtaining the rendering results of the edited scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can achieve ideal editing results not only on synthetic data, but also on real scenes captured by users."}

Towards this goal, we construct a new fine-grained dataset, called FineDiving, developed on diverse diving events with detailed annotations on action procedures. We also propose a procedure-aware approach for action quality assessment, learned by a new Temporal Segmentation Attention module. Specifically, we propose to parse pairwise query and exemplar action instances into consecutive steps with diverse semantic and temporal correspondences. The procedure-aware cross-attention is proposed to learn embeddings between query and exemplar steps to discover their semantic, spatial, and temporal correspondences, and further serve for fine-grained contrastive regression to derive a reliable scoring mechanism.

Nevertheless, applying existing approaches to real-world scenarios remains an open challenge, due to an inherent trade-off between reconstruction and editability: latent space regions which can accurately represent real images typically suffer from degraded semantic control. Recent work proposes to mitigate this trade-off by fine-tuning the generator to add the target image to well-behaved, editable regions of the latent space. While promising, this fine-tuning scheme is impractical for prevalent use as it requires a lengthy training phase for each new image. In this work, we introduce this approach into the realm of encoder-based inversion. We propose HyperStyle, a hypernetwork that learns to modulate StyleGAN's weights to faithfully express a given image in editable regions of the latent space. A naive modulation approach would require training a hypernetwork with over three billion parameters. Through careful network design, we reduce this to be in line with existing encoders. HyperStyle yields reconstructions comparable to those of optimization techniques with the near real-time inference capabilities of encoders. Lastly, we demonstrate HyperStyle's effectiveness on several applications beyond the inversion task, including the editing of out-of-domain images which were never seen during training."}

These limitations are addressed with the corresponding three contributions. First, we propose a new Detection Split Transformer (DESTR) that separates estimation of cross-attention into two independent branches -- one tailored for classification and the other for box regression. Second, we use a mini-detector to initialize the content queries in the decoder with classification and regression embeddings of the respective heads in the mini-detector. Third, we augment self-attention in the decoder to additionally account for pairs of adjacent object queries.

We use Graph neural network and Transformer to encode the shape and interaction information among the map sub-graphs and the agents sub-graphs. In addition, we propose a variance-based non-maximum suppression strategy to select representative trajectories that ensure the diversity of the final output. Experiments on the Argoverse dataset show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and the lane segments-based proposals as well as the variance-based non-maximum suppression strategy both contribute to the performance improvement.

Recently, pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) has been proposed to remove the spatial correlation of real-world noise. However, it is not trivial to integrate PD and BSN directly, which prevents the fully self-supervised denoising model on real-world images. We propose an Asymmetric PD (AP) to address this issue, which introduces different PD stride factors for training and inference. We systematically demonstrate that the proposed AP can resolve inherent trade-offs caused by specific PD stride factors and make BSN applicable to practical scenarios. To this end, we develop AP-BSN, a state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising method for real-world sRGB images. We further propose random-replacing refinement, which significantly improves the performance of our AP-BSN without any additional parameters. Extensive studies demonstrate that our method outperforms the other self-supervised and even unpaired denoising methods by a large margin, without using any additional knowledge, e.g., noise level, regarding the underlying unknown noise."}

In this paper, we propose an autoregressive prior for 3D shapes to solve multimodal 3D tasks such as shape completion, reconstruction, and generation. We model the distribution over 3D shapes as a non-sequential autoregressive distribution over a discretized, low-dimensional, symbolic grid-like latent representation of 3D shapes. This enables us to represent distributions over 3D shapes conditioned on information from an arbitrary set of spatially anchored query locations and thus perform shape completion in such arbitrary settings (e.g. generating a complete chair given only a view of the back leg). We also show that the learned autoregressive prior can be leveraged for conditional tasks such as single-view reconstruction and language-based generation. This is achieved by learning task-specific 'naive' conditionals which can be approximated by light-weight models trained on minimal paired data. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using both quantitative and qualitative evaluation and show that the proposed method outperforms the specialized state-of-the-art methods trained for individual tasks.

The benefit of the inductive bias the network imposes in the DIP framework depends on the architecture. Therefore, researchers have studied how to automate the search to determine the best-performing model. However, common neural architecture search (NAS) techniques are resource and time-intensive. Moreover, best-performing models are determined for a whole dataset of images instead of for each image independently, which would be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first show that optimal neural architectures in the DIP framework are image-dependent. Leveraging this insight, we then propose an image-specific NAS strategy for the DIP framework that requires substantially less training than typical NAS approaches, effectively enabling image-specific NAS. We justify the proposed strategy's effectiveness by (1) demonstrating its performance on a NAS Dataset for DIP that includes 522 models from a particular search space (2) conducting extensive experiments on image denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks. Our experiments show that image-specific metrics can reduce the search space to a small cohort of models, of which the best model outperforms current NAS approaches for image restoration.

To reduce the memory and computational cost, existing point-based pipelines usually adopt task-agnostic random sampling or farthest point sampling to progressively downsample input point clouds, despite the fact that not all points are equally important to the task of object detection. In particular, the foreground points are inherently more important than background points for object detectors. Motivated by this, we propose a highly-efficient single-stage point-based 3D detector in this paper, termed IA-SSD. The key of our approach is to exploit two learnable, task-oriented, instance-aware downsampling strategies to hierarchically select the foreground points belonging to objects of interest. Additionally, we also introduce a contextual centroid perception module to further estimate precise instance centers. Finally, we build our \\nickname   following the encoder-only architecture for efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on several large-scale detection benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of our IA-SSD.

In real-world FL implementations, client data could have label noise, and different clients could have vastly different label noise levels. Although there exist methods in centralized learning for tackling label noise, such methods do not perform well on heterogeneous label noise in FL settings, due to the typically smaller sizes of client datasets and data privacy requirements in FL. In this paper, we propose FedCorr, a general multi-stage framework to tackle heterogeneous label noise in FL, without making any assumptions on the noise models of local clients, while still maintaining client data privacy. In particular, (1) FedCorr dynamically identifies noisy clients by exploiting the dimensionalities of the model prediction subspaces independently measured on all clients, and then identifies incorrect labels on noisy clients based on per-sample losses. To deal with data heterogeneity and to increase training stability, we propose an adaptive local proximal regularization term that is based on estimated local noise levels. (2) We further finetune the global model on identified clean clients and correct the noisy labels for the remaining noisy clients after finetuning. (3) Finally, we apply the usual training on all clients to make full use of all local data. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10/100 with federated synthetic label noise, and on a real-world noisy dataset, Clothing1M, demonstrate that FedCorr is robust to label noise and substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods at multiple noise levels."}

In this work, we propose RigNeRF, a system that goes beyond just novel view synthesis and enables full control of head pose and facial expressions learned from a single portrait video. We model changes in head pose and facial expressions using a deformation field that is guided by a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). The 3DMM effectively acts as a prior for RigNeRF that learns to predict only residuals to the 3DMM deformations and allows us to render novel (rigid) poses and (non-rigid) expressions that were not present in the input sequence. Using only a smartphone-captured short video of a subject for training,we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on free view synthesis of a portrait scene with explicit head pose and expression controls."}

Storing these pre-built 3D scene models can be prohibitively expensive for large-scale environments, especially on mobile devices with limited storage and communication bandwidth. We design a novel framework that compresses a scene while still maintaining localization accuracy. The scene is compressed in three stages: first, the database frames are clustered using pairwise co-visibility information. Then, a learned point selection module prunes the points in each cluster taking into account the final pose estimation accuracy. In the final stage, the features of the selected points are further compressed using learned quantization. Query image registration is done using only the compressed scene points. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose learned scene compression for visual localization. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method on various outdoor datasets where it can perform accurate localization with low memory consumption."}

Explicit methods require a predefined template mesh for a given sequence, while the template is hard to acquire for a specific subject. Meanwhile, the fixed topology limits the reconstruction accuracy and clothing types. Implicit representation supports arbitrary topology and can represent high-fidelity geometry shapes due to its continuous nature. However, it is difficult to integrate multi-frame information to produce a consistent registration sequence for downstream applications. We propose to combine the advantages of both representations. We utilize differential mask loss of the explicit mesh to obtain the coherent overall shape, while the details on the implicit surface are refined with the differentiable neural rendering. Meanwhile, the explicit mesh is updated periodically to adjust its topology changes, and a consistency loss is designed to match both representations. Compared with existing methods, SelfRecon can produce high-fidelity surfaces for arbitrary clothed humans with self-supervised optimization.

However, the pre-determined composition of multiple data augmentations brings two drawbacks. First, the artificial choice of augmentation types brings specific representational invariances to the model, which have different degrees of positive and negative effects on different downstream tasks. Treating each type of augmentation equally during training makes the model learn non-optimal representations for various downstream tasks and limits the flexibility to choose augmentation types beforehand. Second, the strong data augmentations used in classic contrastive learning methods may bring too much invariance in some cases, and fine-grained information that is essential to some downstream tasks may be lost. This paper proposes a general method to alleviate these two problems by considering \"where\" and \"what\" to contrast in a general contrastive learning framework. We first propose to learn different augmentation invariances at different depths of the model according to the importance of each data augmentation instead of learning representational invariances evenly in the backbone. We then propose to expand the contrast content with augmentation embeddings to reduce the misleading effects of strong data augmentations. Experiments based on several baseline methods demonstrate that we learn better representations for various benchmarks on classification, detection, and segmentation downstream tasks."}

However, when it comes to long-horizon tasks with extended sequences of actions, an agent can easily ignore some instructions or get stuck in the middle of the long instructions and eventually fail the task. To address this challenge, we propose a model-agnostic milestone-based task tracker (M-Track) to guide the agent and monitor its progress. Specifically, we propose a milestone builder that tags the instructions with navigation and interaction milestones which the agent needs to complete step by step, and a milestone checker that systemically checks the agent's progress in its current milestone and determines when to proceed to the next. On the challenging ALFRED dataset, our M-Track leads to a notable 33% and 52% relative improvement in unseen success rate over two competitive base models."}

Most recent studies in visual reasoning are dedicated to improving the accuracy of predicted answers, and less attention is paid to explaining the rationales behind the decisions. As a result, they commonly take advantage of spurious biases instead of actually reasoning on the visual-textual data, and have yet developed the capability to explain their decision making by considering key information from both modalities. This paper aims to close the gap from three distinct perspectives: first, we define a new type of multi-modal explanations that explain the decisions by progressively traversing the reasoning process and grounding keywords in the images. We develop a functional program to sequentially execute different reasoning steps and construct a new dataset with 1,040,830 multi-modal explanations. Second, we identify the critical need to tightly couple important components across the visual and textual modalities for explaining the decisions, and propose a novel explanation generation method that explicitly models the pairwise correspondence between words and regions of interest. It improves the visual grounding capability by a considerable margin, resulting in enhanced interpretability and reasoning performance.

Lacking compositionality could have severe implications for robustness and fairness, e.g., inability to synthesize the face images of underrepresented demographic groups. In this paper, we introduce a new framework, StyleT2I, to improve the compositionality of text-to-image synthesis. Specifically, we propose a CLIP-guided Contrastive Loss to better distinguish different compositions among different sentences. To further improve the compositionality, we design a novel Semantic Matching Loss and a Spatial Constraint to identify attributes' latent directions for intended spatial region manipulations, leading to better disentangled latent representations of attributes. Based on the identified latent directions of attributes, we propose Compositional Attribute Adjustment to adjust the latent code, resulting in better compositionality of image synthesis. In addition, we leverage the l_2-norm regularization of identified latent directions (norm penalty) to strike a nice balance between image-text alignment and image fidelity. In the experiments, we devise a new dataset split and an evaluation metric to evaluate the compositionality of text-to-image synthesis models. The results show that StyleT2I outperforms previous approaches in terms of the consistency between the input text and synthesized images and achieves higher fidelity."}

However, these steps discard both the sparsity and high temporal resolution of events, leading to high computational burden and latency. For this reason, recent works have adopted Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which process events as \"static\" spatio-temporal graphs, which are inherently \"sparse\". We take this trend one step further by introducing Asynchronous, Event-based Graph Neural Networks (AEGNNs), a novel event-processing paradigm that generalizes standard GNNs to process events as \"evolving\" spatio-temporal graphs. AEGNNs follow efficient update rules that restrict recomputation of network activations only to the nodes affected by each new event, thereby significantly reducing both computation and latency for event-by-event processing. AEGNNs are easily trained on synchronous inputs and can be converted to efficient, \"asynchronous\" networks at test time. We thoroughly validate our method on object classification and detection tasks, where we show an up to a 200-fold reduction in computational complexity (FLOPs), with similar or even better performance than state-of-the-art asynchronous methods. This reduction in computation directly translates to an 8-fold reduction in computational latency when compared to standard GNNs, which opens the door to low-latency event-based processing."}

Despite the labeling efficiency, wide and large networks are required to achieve high accuracy, which incurs a high amount of computation and hinders the pragmatic merit of self-supervised learning. To effectively reduce the computation of insignificant features or channels, recent dynamic pruning algorithms for supervised learning employed auxiliary salience predictors. However, we found that such salience predictors cannot be easily trained when they are naively applied to contrastive learning from scratch. To address this issue, we propose contrastive dual gating(CDG), a novel dynamic pruning algorithm that skips the uninformative features during contrastive learning without hurting the trainability of the networks. We demonstrate the superiority of CDG with ResNet models for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 datasets. Compared to our implementations of state-of-the-art dynamic pruning algorithms for self-supervised learning, CDG achieves up to 15% accuracy improvement for CIFAR-10 dataset with higher computation reduction."}

Such approach withholds MLPs from getting comparable performance with their transformer-based counterparts and prevents them from becoming a general backbone for computer vision. This paper presents Hire-MLP, a simple yet competitive vision MLP architecture via Hierarchical rearrangement, which contains two levels of rearrangements. Specifically, the inner-region rearrangement is proposed to capture local information inside a spatial region, and the cross-region rearrangement is proposed to enable information communication between different regions and capture global context by circularly shifting all tokens along spatial directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Hire-MLP as a versatile backbone for various vision tasks. In particular, Hire-MLP achieves competitive results on image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation tasks, e.g., 83.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.7% box AP and 44.8% mask AP on COCO val2017, and 49.9% mIoU on ADE20K, surpassing previous transformer-based and MLP-based models with better trade-off for accuracy and throughput."}

Accurate and generalizable absolute 3D human pose estimation from monocular 2D pose input is an ill-posed problem. To address this challenge, we convert the input from pixel space to 3D normalized rays. This conversion makes our approach robust to camera intrinsic parameter changes. To deal with the in-the-wild camera extrinsic parameter variations, Ray3D explicitly takes the camera extrinsic parameters as an input and jointly models the distribution between the 3D pose rays and camera extrinsic parameters. This novel network design is the key to the outstanding generalizability of Ray3D approach. To have a comprehensive understanding of how the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameter variations affect the accuracy of absolute 3D key-point localization, we conduct in-depth systematic experiments on three single person 3D benchmarks as well as one synthetic benchmark. These experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and the synthetic dataset are available at https://github.com/YxZhxn/Ray3D."}

Without the boundary information of action segments, existing methods mostly rely on multiple instance learning (MIL), where the predictions of unlabeled instances (i.e., video snippets) are supervised by classifying labeled bags (i.e., untrimmed videos). However, this formulation typically treats snippets in a video as independent instances, ignoring the underlying temporal structures within and across action segments. To address this problem, we propose \\system, a novel WTAL framework that enables explicit, action-aware segment modeling beyond standard MIL-based methods. Our framework entails three segment-centric components: (i) dynamic segment sampling for compensating the contribution of short actions; (ii) intra- and inter-segment attention for modeling action dynamics and capturing temporal dependencies; (iii) pseudo instance-level supervision for improving action boundary prediction. Furthermore, a multi-step refinement strategy is proposed to progressively improve action proposals along the model training process.

Inspired by recent advances in vision transformers (ViTs), in this paper, we demonstrate that using a few large convolutional kernels instead of a stack of small kernels could be a more powerful paradigm. We suggested five guidelines, e.g., applying re-parameterized large depth-wise convolutions, to design efficient high-performance large-kernel CNNs. Following the guidelines, we propose RepLKNet, a pure CNN architecture whose kernel size is as large as 31x31, in contrast to commonly used 3x3. RepLKNet greatly closes the performance gap between CNNs and ViTs, e.g., achieving comparable or superior results than Swin Transformer on ImageNet and a few typical downstream tasks, with lower latency. RepLKNet also shows nice scalability to big data and large models, obtaining 87.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and 56.0% mIoU on ADE20K, which is very competitive among the state-of-the-arts with similar model sizes. Our study further reveals that, in contrast to small-kernel CNNs, large-kernel CNNs have much larger effective receptive fields and higher shape bias rather than texture bias.

In this work, we conjecture that attention mechanisms can replace the role of explicit feature matching and RANSAC, and thus propose an end-to-end framework to directly predict the final set of correspondences. We use a network architecture consisting primarily of transformer layers containing self and cross attentions, and train it to predict the probability each point lies in the overlapping region and its corresponding position in the other point cloud. The required rigid transformation can then be estimated directly from the predicted correspondences without further post-processing.

This has significantly boosted the development of artificial speech applications. However, there also exist many scenarios that cannot be well reflected by these VC tasks, such as movie dubbing, which requires the speech to be with emotions consistent with the movie plots. To fill this gap, in this work we propose a new task named Visual Voice Cloning (V2C), which seeks to convert a paragraph of text to a speech with both desired voice specified by a reference audio and desired emotion specified by a reference video. To facilitate research in this field, we construct a dataset, V2C-Animation, and propose a strong baseline based on existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) VC techniques. Our dataset contains 10,217 animated movie clips covering a large variety of genres (e.g., Comedy, Fantasy) and emotions (e.g., happy, sad). We further design a set of evaluation metrics, named MCD-DTW-SL, which help evaluate the similarity between ground-truth speeches and the synthesised ones.

Based on this observation, we propose two strategies to improve the AP loss. The first of these is a novel Adaptive Pairwise Error (APE) loss that focusing on ranking pairs in both positive and negative samples. Moreover, we select more accurate ranking pairs by exploiting the normalized ranking scores and localization scores with a clustering algorithm.

Emerging concerns over the robustness of these models against real-world deformations must be addressed practically and reliably. In this work, we propose 3DeformRS, a method to certify the robustness of point cloud Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against real-world deformations. We developed 3DeformRS by building upon recent work that generalized Randomized Smoothing (RS) from pixel-intensity perturbations to vector-field deformations. In particular, we specialized RS to certify DNNs against parameterized deformations (e.g. rotation, twisting), while enjoying practical computational costs. We leverage the virtues of 3DeformRS to conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the certified robustness of four representative point cloud DNNs on two datasets and against seven different deformations. Compared to previous approaches for certifying point cloud DNNs, 3DeformRS is fast, scales well with point cloud size, and provides comparable-to-better certificates. For instance, when certifying a plain PointNet against a 3deg z-rotation on 1024-point clouds, 3DeformRS grants a certificate 3x larger and 20x faster than previous work."}

Unfortunately, labeled training data does not yet exist for many human activities since 3D annotation requires dedicated motion capture systems. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised approach that learns to predict a 3D human pose from a single image while only being trained with 2D pose data, which can be crowd-sourced and is already widely available. To this end, we estimate the 3D pose that is most likely over random projections, with the likelihood estimated using normalizing flows on 2D poses. While previous work requires strong priors on camera rotations in the training data set, we learn the distribution of camera angles which significantly improves the performance. Another part of our contribution is to stabilize training with normalizing flows on high-dimensional 3D pose data by first projecting the 2D poses to a linear subspace. We outperform state-of-the-art in unsupervised human pose estimation on the benchmark dataset Human3.6M in all metrics."}

We use events to bridge a spatio-temporal connection between RS and GS, establish a flow estimation module to correct edge distortions, and design a synthesis-based restoration module to restore occluded regions. The results of two branches are fused through a refining module to generate corrected GS images.

Most real-world datasets lack these diversities. In contrast, data synthesis can easily ensure those diversities separately. However, constructing both valid and diverse hand-object interactions and efficiently learning from the vast synthetic data is still challenging. To address the above issues, we propose ArtiBoost, a lightweight online data enhancement method. ArtiBoost can cover diverse hand-object poses and camera viewpoints through sampling in a Composited hand-object Configuration and Viewpoint space (CCV-space) and can adaptively enrich the current hard-discernable items by loss-feedback and sample re-weighting. ArtiBoost alternatively performs data exploration and synthesis within a learning pipeline, and those synthetic data are blended into real-world source data for training.

It has been shown that disease progression can be better characterized by temporal imaging. We therefore hypothesized that outcome predictions can be improved by utilizing the disease progression information from sequential images. We present a deep learning approach that leverages temporal progression information to improve clinical outcome predictions from single-timepoint images. In our method, a self-attention based Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is used to learn a representation that is most reflective of the disease trajectory. Meanwhile, a Vision Transformer is pretrained in a self-supervised fashion to extract features from single-timepoint images. The key contribution is to design a recalibration module that employs maximum mean discrepancy loss (MMD) to align distributions of the above two contextual representations. We train our system to predict clinical outcomes and severity grades from single-timepoint images.

The most common and effective way to promote small object detection is to use high-resolution images or feature maps. However, both approaches induce costly computation since the computational cost grows squarely as the size of images and features increases. To get the best of two worlds, we propose QueryDet that uses a novel query mechanism to accelerate the inference speed of feature-pyramid based object detectors. The pipeline composes two steps: it first predicts the coarse locations of small objects on low-resolution features and then computes the accurate detection results using high-resolution features sparsely guided by those coarse positions. In this way, we can not only harvest the benefit of high-resolution feature maps but also avoid useless computation for the background area. On the popular COCO dataset, the proposed method improves the detection mAP by 1.0 and mAP small by 2.0, and the high-resolution inference speed is improved to 3.0x on average. On VisDrone dataset, which contains more small objects, we create a new state-of-the-art while gaining a 2.3x high-resolution acceleration on average.

Specifically, we propose a temporal consistency learning module to align two consecutive point cloud frames point-wisely, based on which we can employ linear interpolation to obtain coarse trajectories/in-between frames. To compensate the high-order nonlinear components of trajectories, we apply aligned feature embeddings that encode local geometry properties to regress point-wise increments, which are combined with the coarse estimations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various point cloud sequences and observe large improvement over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually.

Training with such noisy data negatively impacts the generalization performance of deep neural networks. To combat label noise, recent state-of-the-art methods employ some sort of sample selection mechanism to select a possibly clean subset of data. Next, an off-the-shelf semi-supervised learning method is used for training where rejected samples are treated as unlabeled data. Our comprehensive analysis shows that current selection methods disproportionately select samples from easy (fast learnable) classes while rejecting those from relatively harder ones. This creates class imbalance in the selected clean set and in turn, deteriorates performance under high label noise. In this work, we propose UNICON, a simple yet effective sample selection method which is robust to high label noise. To address the disproportionate selection of easy and hard samples, we introduce a Jensen-Shannon divergence based uniform selection mechanism which does not require any probabilistic modeling and hyperparameter tuning. We complement our selection method with contrastive learning to further combat the memorization of noisy labels. Extensive experimentation on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of UNICON; we obtain an 11.4% improvement over the current state-of-the-art on CIFAR100 dataset with a 90% noise rate.

State-of-the-art 3D generative models are GANs which use neural 3D volumetric representations for synthesis. Images are synthesized by rendering the volumes from a given camera. These models can disentangle the 3D scene from the camera viewpoint in any generated image. However, most models do not disentangle other factors of image formation, such as geometry and appearance. In this paper, we design a 3D GAN which can learn a disentangled model of objects, just from monocular observations. Our model can disentangle the geometry and appearance variations in the scene, i.e., we can independently sample from the geometry and appearance spaces of the generative model. This is achieved using a novel non-rigid deformable scene formulation. A 3D volume which represents an object instance is computed as a non-rigidly deformed canonical 3D volume. Our method learns the canonical volume, as well as its deformations, jointly during training. This formulation also helps us improve the disentanglement between the 3D scene and the camera viewpoints using a novel pose regularization loss defined on the 3D deformation field. In addition, we further model the inverse deformations, enabling the computation of dense correspondences between images generated by our model.

We present a novel two-phase strategy in this research that fits all requirements at the same time. In the first phase, we train an encoder to map the input image to StyleGAN2 W-space, which was proven to have excellent editability but lower reconstruction quality. In the second phase, we supplement the reconstruction ability in the initial phase by leveraging a series of hypernetworks to recover the missing information during inversion. These two steps complement each other to yield high reconstruction quality thanks to the hypernetwork branch and excellent editability due to the inversion done in the W-space.

Driven by end-to-end deep learning, recent studies suggest interpreting PnP as a differentiable layer, so that 2D-3D point correspondences can be partly learned by backpropagating the gradient w.r.t. object pose. Yet, learning the entire set of unrestricted 2D-3D points from scratch fails to converge with existing approaches, since the deterministic pose is inherently non-differentiable. In this paper, we propose the EPro-PnP, a probabilistic PnP layer for general end-to-end pose estimation, which outputs a distribution of pose on the SE(3) manifold, essentially bringing categorical Softmax to the continuous domain. The 2D-3D coordinates and corresponding weights are treated as intermediate variables learned by minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and target pose distribution. The underlying principle unifies the existing approaches and resembles the attention mechanism. EPro-PnP significantly outperforms competitive baselines, closing the gap between PnP-based method and the task-specific leaders on the LineMOD 6DoF pose estimation and nuScenes 3D object detection benchmarks."}

Toward an effective network architecture, we present complemental sub-solutions learning with a one-encoder-two-decoder architecture for single image deblurring. Observing that multiple decoders successfully learn to decompose information in the encoded features into directional components, we further improve both the network efficiency and the deblurring performance by rotating and sharing kernels exploited in the decoders, which prevents the decoders from separating unnecessary components such as color shift. As a result, our proposed network shows superior results as compared to U-Net while preserving the network parameters, and the use of the proposed network as the base network can improve the performance of existing state-of-the-art deblurring networks."}

This paper makes the first attempt to conduct a comprehensive study on the robustness of deep learning-based rain removal methods against adversarial attacks. Our study shows that, when the image/video is highly degraded, rain removal methods are more vulnerable to the adversarial attacks as small distortions/perturbations become less noticeable or detectable. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of various methods at different levels of attacks and with various losses/targets to generate the perturbations from the perspective of human perception and machine analysis tasks. A systematic evaluation of key modules in existing methods is performed in terms of their robustness against adversarial attacks. From the insights of our analysis, we construct a more robust deraining method by integrating these effective modules. Finally, we examine various types of adversarial attacks that are specific to deraining problems and their effects on both human and machine vision tasks, including 1) rain region attacks, adding perturbations only in the rain regions to make the perturbations in the attacked rain images less visible; 2) object-sensitive attacks, adding perturbations only in regions near the given objects.

Point cloud, the most important data format for 3D environmental perception, is naturally endowed with strong radial symmetry. In this work, we exploit this radial symmetry via a divide-and-conquer strategy to boost 3D perception performance and ease optimization. We propose Azimuth Normalization (AziNorm), which normalizes the point clouds along the radial direction and eliminates the variability brought by the difference of azimuth. AziNorm can be flexibly incorporated into most LiDAR-based perception methods. To validate its effectiveness and generalization ability, we apply AziNorm in both object detection and semantic segmentation. For detection, we integrate AziNorm into two representative detection methods, the one-stage SECOND detector and the state-of-the-art two-stage PV-RCNN detector. Experiments on Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that AziNorm improves SECOND and PV-RCNN by 7.03 mAPH and 3.01 mAPH respectively. For segmentation, we integrate AziNorm into KPConv. On SemanticKitti dataset, AziNorm improves KPConv by 1.6/1.1 mIoU on val/test set. Besides, AziNorm remarkably improves data efficiency and accelerates convergence, reducing the requirement of data amounts or training epochs by an order of magnitude. SECOND w/ AziNorm can significantly outperform fully trained vanilla SECOND, even trained with only 10% data or 10% epochs. Code and models are available at https://github.com/hustvl/AziNorm."}

Shadows, highlights, and inter-reflections caused by visible and invisible light sources require reasoning about long-range interactions for inverse rendering, which seeks to recover the components of image formation, namely, shape, material, and lighting. In this work, our intuition is that the long-range attention learned by transformer architectures is ideally suited to solve longstanding challenges in single-image inverse rendering. We demonstrate with a specific instantiation of a dense vision transformer, \\Ours  , that excels at both single-task and multi-task reasoning required for inverse rendering. Specifically, we propose a transformer architecture to simultaneously estimate depths, normals, spatially-varying albedo, roughness and lighting from a single image of an indoor scene. Our extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results on each of the above tasks, enabling applications like object insertion and material editing in a single unconstrained real image, with greater photorealism than prior works.

These observations are paired with pixel-wise monthly semantic segmentation labels of 7 land use and land cover (LULC) classes. DynamicEarthNet is the first dataset that provides this unique combination of daily measurements and high-quality labels. In our experiments, we compare several established baselines that either utilize the daily observations as additional training data (semi-supervised learning) or multiple observations at once (spatio-temporal learning) as a point of reference for future research.

Collaborative analysis of such complementary-view data can facilitate to build the air-ground cooperative visual system for various kinds of applications. This is a very challenging problem due to the large view difference between top and side views. In this paper, we develop a new approach that can simultaneously handle three tasks: i) localizing the side-view camera in the top view; ii) estimating the view direction of the side-view camera; iii) detecting and associating the same subjects on the ground across the complementary views. Our main idea is to explore the spatial position layout of the subjects in two views. In particular, we propose a spatial-aware position representation method to embed the spatial-position distribution of the subjects in different views. We further design a cross-view video collaboration framework composed of a camera identification module and a subject association module to simultaneously perform the above three tasks. We collect a new synthetic dataset consisting of top-view and side-view video sequence pairs for performance evaluation and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

Existing methods typically convert this task into a conditional inpainting problem, which requires an additional mask from users indicating the region to modify. Then the masked regions are regarded as missing and filled by an inpainting model conditioned on the sketch. With this formulation, paired training data can be easily obtained by randomly creating masks and extracting edges or contours. Although this setup simplifies data preparation and model design, it complicates user interaction and discards useful information in masked regions. To this end, we propose a new framework for sketch-based image manipulation that only requires sketch inputs from users and utilizes the entire original image. Given an image and sketch, our model automatically predicts the target modification region and encodes it into a structure agnostic style vector. A generator then synthesizes the new image content based on the style vector and sketch. The manipulated image is finally produced by blending the generator output into the modification region of the original image. Our model can be trained in a self-supervised fashion by learning the reconstruction of an image region from the style vector and sketch. The proposed framework offers simpler and more intuitive user workflows for sketch-based image manipulation and provides better results than previous approaches. The code and interactive demo can be found in the supplementary material."}

In this paper, we introduce a novel contour-based method, named E2EC, for high-quality instance segmentation. Firstly, E2EC applies a novel learnable contour initialization architecture instead of handcrafted contour initialization. This consists of a contour initialization module for constructing more explicit learning goals and a global contour deformation module for taking advantage of all of the vertices' features better. Secondly, we propose a novel label sampling scheme, named multi-direction alignment, to reduce the learning difficulty. Thirdly, to improve the quality of the boundary details, we dynamically match the most appropriate predicted-ground truth vertex pairs and propose the corresponding loss function named dynamic matching loss. The experiments showed that E2EC can achieve a state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI INStance (KINS) dataset, the Semantic Boundaries Dataset (SBD), the Cityscapes and the COCO dataset. E2EC is also efficient for use in real-time applications, with an inference speed of 36 fps for 512x512 images on an NVIDIA A6000 GPU.

To address the above-mentioned issues, a variety of methods have been devised to explore the sample relationships in a vanilla way (i.e., from the perspectives of either the input or the loss function), failing to explore the internal structure of deep neural networks for learning with sample relationships. Inspired by this, we propose to enable deep neural networks themselves with the ability to learn the sample relationships from each mini-batch. Specifically, we introduce a batch transformer module or BatchFormer, which is then applied into the batch dimension of each mini-batch to implicitly explore sample relationships during training. By doing this, the proposed method enables the collaboration of different samples, e.g., the head-class samples can also contribute to the learning of the tail classes for long-tailed recognition. Furthermore, to mitigate the gap between training and testing, we share the classifier between with or without the BatchFormer during training, which can thus be removed during testing. We perform extensive experiments on over ten datasets and the proposed method achieves significant improvements on different data scarcity applications without any bells and whistles, including the tasks of long-tailed recognition, compositional zero-shot learning, domain generalization, and contrastive learning.

Recent approaches pre-train a feature extractor, and then fine-tune for episodic meta-learning. Other methods leverage spatial features to learn pixel-level correspondence while jointly training a classifier. However, results using such approaches show marginal improvements. In this paper, inspired by the transformer style self-attention mechanism, we propose a strategy to cross-attend and re-weight discriminative features for few-shot classification. Given a base representation of support and query images after global pooling, we introduce a single shared module that projects features and cross-attends in two aspects: (i) query to support, and (ii) support to query. The module computes attention scores between features to produce an attention pooled representation of features in the same class that is later added to the original representation followed by a projection head. This effectively re-weights features in both aspects (i & ii) to produce features that better facilitate improved metric-based meta-learning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3% 5%."}

In this work, we study a novel task on text-guided image manipulation on the entity level in the real world. The task imposes three basic requirements, (1) to edit the entity consistent with the text descriptions, (2) to preserve the text-irrelevant regions, and (3) to merge the manipulated entity into the image naturally. To this end, we propose a new transformer-based framework based on the two-stage image synthesis method, namely ManiTrans, which can not only edit the appearance of entities but also generate new entities corresponding to the text guidance. Our framework incorporates a semantic alignment module to locate the image regions to be manipulated, and a semantic loss to help align the relationship between the vision and language. We conduct extensive experiments on the real datasets, CUB, Oxford, and COCO datasets to verify that our method can distinguish the relevant and irrelevant regions and achieve more precise and flexible manipulation compared with baseline methods."}

Previous methods employ either explicit priors to constrain the problem or implicit constraints as formulated by their losses (deep learning). These methods can be negatively influenced by strong illumination conditions causing shading-reflectance leakages. Therefore, in this paper, an end-to-end edge-driven hybrid CNN approach is proposed for intrinsic image decomposition. Edges correspond to illumination invariant gradients. To handle hard negative illumination transitions, a hierarchical approach is taken including global and local refinement layers. We make use of attention layers to further strengthen the learning process. An extensive ablation study and large scale experiments are conducted showing that it is beneficial for edge-driven hybrid IID networks to make use of illumination invariant descriptors and that separating global and local cues helps in improving the performance of the network. Finally, it is shown that the proposed method obtains state of the art performance and is able to generalise well to real world images.

While single image depth estimation is spared from these challenges and can achieve satisfactory results with the extracted monocular cues, the lack of stereoscopic relationship renders the monocular prediction less reliable on its own, especially in highly dynamic or cluttered environments. To address these issues in both scenarios, we present an optic-chiasm-inspired self-supervised binocular depth estimation method, wherein a vision transformer (ViT) with gated positional cross-attention (GPCA) layers is designed to enable feature-sensitive pattern retrieval between views while retaining the extensive context information aggregated through self-attentions. Monocular cues from a single view are thereafter conditionally rectified by a blending layer with the retrieved pattern pairs. This crossover design is biologically analogous to the optic-chasma structure in the human visual system and hence the name, ChiTransformer. Our experiments show that this architecture yields substantial improvements over state-of-the-art self-supervised stereo approaches by 11%, and can be used on both rectilinear and non-rectilinear (e.g., fisheye) images."}

The self-supervised contrastive learning has already been successfully applied in the I2I. By constraining features from the same location to be closer than those from different ones, it implicitly ensures the result to take content from the source. However, previous work uses the features from random locations to impose the constraint, which may not be appropriate since some locations contain less information of source domain. Moreover, the feature itself does not reflect the relation with others. This paper deals with these problems by intentionally selecting significant anchor points for contrastive learning. We design a query-selected attention (QS-Attn) module, which compares feature distances in the source domain, giving an attention matrix with a probability distribution in each row. Then we select queries according to their measurement of significance, computed from the distribution. The selected ones are regarded as anchors for contrastive loss. At the same time, the reduced attention matrix is employed to route features in both domains, so that source relations maintain in the synthesis. We validate our proposed method in three different I2I datasets, showing that it increases the image quality without adding learnable parameters."}

Particularly, our representation, named H4D, represents a dynamic 3D human over a temporal span with the SMPL parameters of shape and initial pose, and latent codes encoding motion and auxiliary information. A simple yet effective linear motion model is proposed to provide a rough and regularized motion estimation, followed by per-frame compensation for pose and geometry details with the residual encoded in the auxiliary code. Technically, we introduce novel GRU-based architectures to facilitate learning and improve the representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method is not only efficacy in recovering dynamic human with accurate motion and detailed geometry, but also amenable to various 4D human related tasks, including motion retargeting, motion completion and future prediction."}

We thus propose a Causal CAM (C-CAM) method to overcome the above challenges. Our method is motivated by two cause-effect chains including category-causality chain and anatomy-causality chain. The category-causality chain represents the image content (cause) affects the category (effect). The anatomy-causality chain represents the anatomical structure (cause) affects the organ segmentation (effect). Extensive experiments were conducted on three public medical image data sets.

However, more recent works find that existing differentiable NAS techniques struggle to outperform naive baselines, yielding deteriorative architectures as the search proceeds. Rather than directly optimizing the architecture parameters, this paper formulates the neural architecture search as a distribution learning problem through relaxing the architecture weights into Gaussian distributions. By leveraging the natural-gradient variational inference (NGVI), the architecture distribution can be easily optimized based on existing codebases without incurring more memory and computational consumption. We demonstrate how the differentiable NAS benefits from Bayesian principles, enhancing exploration and improving stability. The experimental results on NAS benchmark datasets confirm the significant improvements the proposed framework can make. In addition, instead of simply applying the argmax on the learned parameters, we further leverage the recently-proposed training-free proxies in NAS to select the optimal architecture from a group architectures drawn from the optimized distribution, where we achieve state-of-the-art results on the NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-1shot1 benchmarks.

TAO benchmark presented a mixture of the two, long-tailed object tracking, in order to further reflect the aspect of the real-world. To date, existing solutions have adopted detectors showing robustness in long-tailed distributions, which derive per-frame results. Then, they used tracking algorithms that combine the temporally independent detections to finalize tracklets.

To cope with sparse annotations in videos, we further propose augmentation of tracklets that can maximize data efficiency. The set classifier is plug-and-playable to existing object trackers, and highly improves the performance of long-tailed object tracking.

To maximize the use of two information flows, we also propose an effective feature fusion module termed Iterative Independent Layer Normalization (IILN) which can condense the most relevant inputs while retraining modality-specific information in each flow. Experiments show that our method is able to enhance the dependence of prediction on visual information, making word prediction more focused on the visual content, and thus achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the MSCOCO dataset, e.g., 136.2 CIDEr on COCO Karpathy test split."}

However, so far it has been only discussed and empirically demonstrated in the context of uniform quantization on convolutional neural networks. We thus propose a new post-training non-uniform quantization method, called Mr.BiQ, allowing low bit-width quantization even on Transformer models. In particular, we leverage multi-level binarization for weights while allowing activations to be represented as various data formats (e.g., INT8, bfloat16, binary-coding, and FP32). Unlike conventional methods which optimize full-precision weights first, then decompose the weights into quantization parameters, Mr.BiQ recognizes the quantization parameters (i.e., scaling factors and bit-code) as directly and jointly learnable parameters during the optimization. To verify the superiority of the proposed quantization scheme, we test Mr.BiQ on various models including convolutional neural networks and Transformer models. According to experimental results, Mr.BiQ shows significant improvement in terms of accuracy when the bit-width of weights is equal to 2: up to 5.35 p.p. improvement in CNNs, up to 4.23 p.p. improvement in Vision Transformers, and up to 3.37 point improvement in Transformers for NLP."}

Among geometric primitives, superquadrics are well known for their ability to represent a wide range of shapes with few parameters.

The existing methods are subject to local optima and sensitive to noise and outliers in real-world scenarios, resulting in frequent failure in capturing geometric shapes.

Our method builds a Gaussian-uniform mixture model (GUM) on the parametric surface of a superquadric, which explicitly models the generation of outliers and noise. The superquadric recovery is formulated as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem. We propose an algorithm, Expectation, Maximization, and Switching (EMS), to solve this problem, where: (1) outliers are predicted from the posterior perspective; (2) the superquadric parameter is optimized by the trust-region reflective algorithm; and (3) local optima are avoided by globally searching and switching among parameters encoding similar superquadrics. We show that our method can be extended to the multi-superquadrics recovery for complex objects. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

To efficiently learn from small quantities of multimodal data, we leverage the linguistic knowledge from a large pre-trained language model (PLM) and quickly adapt it to new domains of image captioning. To effectively utilize a pretrained model, it is critical to balance the visual input and prior linguistic knowledge from pretraining. We propose VisualGPT, which employs a novel self-resurrecting encoder-decoder attention mechanism to quickly adapt the PLM with a small amount of in-domain image-text data. The proposed self-resurrecting activation unit produces sparse activations that prevent accidental overwriting of linguistic knowledge. When trained on 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% of the respective training sets, VisualGPT surpasses the best baseline by up to 10.0% CIDEr on MS COCO and 17.9% CIDEr on Conceptual Captions. Furthermore, VisualGPT achieves the state-of-the-art result on IU X-ray, a medical report generation dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/VisualGPT."}

Conventional methods either focus on 2D visual cues or exploit additional depth information in a very coarse manner. In this work, we propose to explicitly and effectively model 3D geometry under challenging scenario where only 2D annotations are available. We first obtain 3D point clouds of given scene with estimated depth and reference objects. Then we figure out the front-most points in all possible 3D directions of given person. These points are later leveraged in our ESCNet model. Specifically, ESCNet consists of geometry and scene parsing modules. The former produces an initial heatmap inferring the probability that each front-most point has been looking at according to estimated 3D gaze direction. And the latter further explores scene contextual cues to regulate detection results. We validate our idea on two publicly available dataset, GazeFollow and VideoAttentionTarget, and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance. Our method also beats the human in terms of AUC on GazeFollow."}

Reverse engineering from a raw geometry to a CAD model is an essential task to enable manipulation of the 3D data in shape editing software and thus expand their usages in many downstream applications. Particularly, the form of CAD models having a sequence of extrusion cylinders --- a 2D sketch plus an extrusion axis and range --- and their boolean combinations is not only widely used in the CAD community/software but also has great expressivity of shapes, compared to having limited types of primitives (e.g., planes, spheres, and cylinders). In this work, we introduce a neural network that solves the extrusion cylinder decomposition problem in a geometry-grounded way by first learning underlying geometric proxies. Precisely, our approach first predicts per-point segmentation, base/barrel labels and normals, then estimates for the underlying extrusion parameters in differentiable and closed-form formulations. Our experiments show that our approach demonstrates the best performance on two recent CAD datasets, Fusion Gallery and DeepCAD, and we further showcase our approach on reverse engineering and editing."}

Most existing works attempt to solve both issues by exploiting spatial and temporal relationships. However, those works ignore the fact that it is an inverse problem where multiple feasible solutions (i.e., hypotheses) exist. To relieve this limitation, we propose a Multi-Hypothesis Transformer (MHFormer) that learns spatio-temporal representations of multiple plausible pose hypotheses. In order to effectively model multi-hypothesis dependencies and build strong relationships across hypothesis features, the task is decomposed into three stages: (i) Generate multiple initial hypothesis representations; (ii) Model self-hypothesis communication, merge multiple hypotheses into a single converged representation and then partition it into several diverged hypotheses; (iii) Learn cross-hypothesis communication and aggregate the multi-hypothesis features to synthesize the final 3D pose. Through the above processes, the final representation is enhanced and the synthesized pose is much more accurate. Extensive experiments show that MHFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Without bells and whistles, its performance surpasses the previous best result by a large margin of 3% on Human3.6M. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Vegetebird/MHFormer."}

While several recent works exploit tree-based algorithm to preserve image content better, all of them resort to hand-crafted adjustment rules to optimize the collage tree structure, leading to the failure of fully exploring the structure space of collage tree. Our key idea is to soften the discrete tree structure space into a continuous probability space. We propose SoftCollage, a novel method that employs a neural-based differentiable probabilistic tree generator to produce the probability distribution of correlation-preserving collage tree conditioned on deep image feature, aspect ratio and canvas size. The differentiable characteristic allows us to formulate the tree-based collage generation as a differentiable process and directly exploit gradient to optimize the collage layout in the level of probability space in an end-to-end manner. To facilitate image collage research, we propose AIC, a large-scale public-available annotated dataset for image collage evaluation.

Existing works often adopt a twostage pipeline by establishing correspondences and utilizing a RANSAC algorithm to calculate 6 degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) pose. Recent works try to integrate differentiable RANSAC algorithms to achieve an end-to-end 6D pose estimation. However, most of them hardly consider the geometric features in 3D space, and ignore the topology cues when performing differentiable RANSAC algorithms. To this end, we proposed a Depth-Guided Edge Convolutional Network (DGECN) for 6D pose estimation task. We have made efforts from the following three aspects: 1) We take advantages of estimated depth information to guide both the correspondences-extraction process and the cascaded differentiable RANSAC algorithm with geometric information. 2)We leverage the uncertainty of the estimated depth map to improve accuracy and robustness of the output 6D pose. 3) We propose a differentiable Perspective-n-Point(PnP) algorithm via edge convolution to explore the topology relations between 2D-3D correspondences.

Previous works have shown compelling comprehensive results by building hierarchical structures for visual scenes (e.g., scene graphs) and natural languages (e.g., dependency trees), individually. However, how to construct a joint vision-language (VL) structure has barely been investigated. More challenging but worthwhile, we introduce a new task that targets on inducing such a joint VL structure in an unsupervised manner. Our goal is to bridge the visual scene graphs and linguistic dependency trees seamlessly. Due to the lack of VL structural data, we start by building a new dataset VLParse. Rather than using labor-intensive labeling from scratch, we propose an automatic alignment procedure to produce coarse structures followed by human refinement to produce high-quality ones. Moreover, we benchmark our dataset by proposing a contrastive learning (CL)-based framework VLGAE, short for Vision-Language Graph Autoencoder. Our model obtains superior performance on two derived tasks, i.e., language grammar induction and VL phrase grounding. Ablations show the effectiveness of both visual cues and dependency relationships on fine-grained VL structure construction."}

The dataset was carefully hand-curated by expert annotators and is labeled with a rich set of fine-grained tags to assist in analyzing model performance. We probe a diverse range of state-of-the-art vision and language models and find that, surprisingly, none of them do much better than chance.

We handle the registration in a coarse-to-fine fashion. For the first time, we exploit the feedback of image fusion to promote the registration accuracy rather than treating them as two separate issues. The fine-registered results also improve the fusion performance. Specifically, for image registration, we solve the bottlenecks of defining registration metrics applicable for multi-modal images and facilitating the network convergence. The metrics are defined based on image translation and image fusion respectively in the coarse and fine stages. The convergence is facilitated by the designed metrics and a deformable convolution-based network. For image fusion, we focus on texture preservation, which not only increases the information amount and quality of fusion results but also improves the feedback of fusion results. The proposed method is evaluated on multi-modal images with large global parallaxes, images with local misalignments and aligned images to validate the performances of registration and fusion. The results in these cases demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}

Recently, we have witnessed great strides in this domain owing to the emergence of powerful deep neural networks. However, there are typically two main assumptions common among these approaches. First, the model is trained on a fixed training set and is evaluated on a pre-recorded test set. Second, the model is kept frozen after the training phase, so no further updates are performed after the training is finished. These two assumptions limit the applicability of these methods to real-world settings. In this paper, we propose Interactron, a method for adaptive object detection in an interactive setting, where the goal is to perform object detection in images observed by an embodied agent navigating in different environments. Our idea is to continue training during inference and adapt the model at test time without any explicit supervision via interacting with the environment. Our adaptive object detection model provides a 11.8 point improvement in AP (and 19.1 points in AP50) over DETR, a recent, high-performance object detector. Moreover, we show that our object detection model adapts to environments with completely different appearance characteristics, and its performance is on par with a model trained with full supervision for those environments. We will release the code to help ease future research in this domain."}

However, existing animal behavior datasets have limitations in multiple aspects, including limited numbers of animal classes, data samples and provided tasks, and also limited variations in environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address these limitations, we create a large and diverse dataset, Animal Kingdom, that provides multiple annotated tasks to enable a more thorough understanding of natural animal behaviors. The wild animal footages used in our dataset record different times of the day in extensive range of environments containing variations in backgrounds, viewpoints, illumination and weather conditions. More specifically, our dataset contains 50 hours of annotated videos to localize relevant animal behavior segments in long videos for the video grounding task, 30K video sequences for the fine-grained multi-label action recognition task, and 33K frames for the pose estimation task, which correspond to a diverse range of animals with 850 species across 6 major animal classes. Such a challenging and comprehensive dataset shall be able to facilitate the community to develop, adapt, and evaluate various types of advanced methods for animal behavior analysis.

In order to remedy the information loss from box annotations to centers, our method, namely Back to Reality (BR), makes use of synthetic 3D shapes to convert the weak labels into fully-annotated virtual scenes as stronger supervision, and in turn utilizes the perfect virtual labels to complement and refine the real labels. Specifically, we first assemble 3D shapes into physically reasonable virtual scenes according to the coarse scene layout extracted from position-level annotations. Then we go back to reality by applying a virtual-to-real domain adaptation method, which refine the weak labels and additionally supervise the training of detector with the virtual scenes. With less than 5% of the labeling labor, we achieve comparable detection performance with some popular fully-supervised approaches on the widely used ScanNet dataset."}

Extensive efforts have been made to conquer the cross-modal retrieval problem in the general domain. When it comes to E-commerce, a common practice is to adopt the pretrained model and finetune on E-commerce data. Despite its simplicity, the performance is sub-optimal due to overlooking the uniqueness of E-commerce multimodal data. A few recent efforts have shown significant improvements over generic methods with customized designs for handling product images. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no existing method has addressed the unique challenges in the e-commerce language. This work studies the outstanding one, where it has a large collection of special meaning entities, e.g., \"Dissel (brand)\", \"Top (category)\", \"relaxed (fit)\" in the fashion clothing business. By formulating such  out-of-distribution  finetuning process in the Causal Inference paradigm, we view the erroneous semantics of these special entities as confounders to cause the retrieval failure. To rectify these semantics for aligning with e-commerce domain knowledge, we propose an intervention-based entity-aware contrastive learning framework with two modules, i.e., the Confounding Entity Selection Module and Entity-Aware Learning Module. Our method achieves competitive performance on the E-commerce benchmark Fashion-Gen.

The proposed tool in this study initially operates with the acquisition of images. Then the animal tracking step begins with background subtraction, followed by the animal contour detection and morphological operations to remove noise in the detected shapes.

Most existing video architectures can only process <5 seconds of a video without hitting the computation or memory bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to overcome this challenge. Instead of trying to process more frames at once like most existing methods, we propose to process videos in an online fashion and cache \"memory\" at each iteration. Through the memory, the model can reference prior context for long-term modeling, with only a marginal cost. Based on this idea, we build MeMViT, a Memory-augmented Multiscale Vision Transformer, that has a temporal support 30x longer than existing models with only 4.5 more compute; traditional methods need >3,000% more compute to do the same. On a wide range of settings, the increased temporal support enabled by MeMViT brings large gains in recognition accuracy consistently.

Existing methods either consider answer ranking and generating individually or only weakly capture the relation across the two tasks implicitly by two separate models. The research on a universal framework that jointly learns to rank and generate answers in a single model is seldom explored. In this paper, we propose a contrastive learning-based framework UTC to unify and facilitate both discriminative and generative tasks in visual dialog with a single model. Specifically, considering the inherent limitation of the previous learning paradigm, we devise two inter-task contrastive losses i.e., context contrastive loss and answer contrastive loss to make the discriminative and generative tasks mutually reinforce each other. These two complementary contrastive losses exploit dialog context and target answer as anchor points to provide representation learning signals from different perspectives. We evaluate our proposed UTC on the VisDial v1.0 dataset, where our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on both discriminative and generative tasks and surpasses previous state-of-the-art generative methods by more than 2 absolute points on Recall@1."}

Previous works mainly focus on mitigating forgetting in phases after the initial one. However, we find that improving CIL at its initial phase is also a promising direction. Specifically, we experimentally show that directly encouraging CIL Learner at the initial phase to output similar representations as the model jointly trained on all classes can greatly boost the CIL performance. Motivated by this, we study the difference between a naively-trained initial-phase model and the oracle model. Specifically, since one major difference between these two models is the number of training classes, we investigate how such difference affects the model representations. We find that, with fewer training classes, the data representations of each class lie in a long and narrow region; with more training classes, the representations of each class scatter more uniformly. Inspired by this observation, we propose Class-wise Decorrelation (CwD) that effectively regularizes representations of each class to scatter more uniformly, thus mimicking the model jointly trained with all classes (i.e., the oracle model). Our CwD is simple to implement and easy to plug into existing methods. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets show that CwD consistently and significantly improves the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods by around 1% to 3%.

However, the large volume of data produced by lidars can lead to high costs in data storage and transmission. While lidar data can be represented as two interchangeable representations: 3D point clouds and range images, most previous work focus on compressing the generic 3D point clouds. In this work, we show that directly compressing the range images can leverage the lidar scanning pattern, compared to compressing the unprojected point clouds. We propose a novel data-driven range image compression algorithm, named RIDDLE (Range Image Deep DeLta Encoding). At its core is a deep model that predicts the next pixel value in a raster scanning order, based on contextual laser shots from both the current and past scans (represented as a 4D point cloud of spherical coordinates and time). The deltas between predictions and original values can then be compressed by entropy encoding. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI, our method demonstrates significant improvement in the compression rate (under the same distortion) compared to widely used point cloud and range image compression algorithms as well as recent deep methods."}

These relationships typically have a long-tail distribution due to their compositional nature. This problem gets more severe when the vocabulary becomes large, rendering this task very challenging. This paper shows that modeling an effective message-passing flow through an attention mechanism can be critical to tackling the compositionality and long-tail challenges in VRR. The method, called RelTransformer, represents each im- age as a fully-connected scene graph and restructures the whole scene into the relation-triplet and global-scene contexts. It directly passes the message from each element in the relation-triplet and global-scene contexts to the target relation via self-attention.

To overcome this challenge, in this paper we propose efficient High-Order DEcomposed Convolution (HODEC). By performing systematic explorations on the underlying reason and mitigation strategy for the computation inefficiency, we develop a new decomposition and computation-efficient execution scheme, enabling simultaneous reductions in computational and storage costs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HODEC, we perform empirical evaluations for various CNN models on different datasets. HODEC shows consistently outstanding compression and acceleration performance. For ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10 dataset, HODEC brings 67% fewer model parameters and 62% fewer FLOPs with 1.17% accuracy increase than the baseline.

A real-world scene can be well modeled as a collection of rigidly moving parts, therefore its scene flow can be represented as a combination of rigid motion of each part. Inspired by this observation, we propose to generate pseudo scene flow for self-supervised learning based on piecewise rigid motion estimation, in which the source point cloud is decomposed into a set of local regions and each region is treated as rigid. By rigidly aligning each region with its potential counterpart in the target point cloud, we obtain a region-specific rigid transformation to represent the flow, which together constitutes the pseudo scene flow labels of the entire scene to enable network training. Compared with most existing approaches relying on point-wise similarities for point matching, our method explicitly enforces region-wise rigid alignments, yielding locally rigid pseudo scene flow labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-supervised learning method on FlyingThings3D and KITTI datasets. Comprehensive experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised scene flow learning, without any ground truth scene flow for supervision, even outperforming some supervised counterparts."}

A good choice of activation function can have a significant effect on improving network performance and training dynamics. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is a popular hand-designed activation function and is the most common choice in the deep learning community due to its simplicity though ReLU has some drawbacks. In this paper, we have proposed two new novel activation functions based on approximation of the maximum function, and we call these functions Smooth Maximum Unit (SMU and SMU-1). We show that SMU and SMU-1 can smoothly approximate ReLU, Leaky ReLU, or more general Maxout family, and GELU is a particular case of SMU. Replacing ReLU by SMU, Top-1 classification accuracy improves by 6.22%, 3.39%, 3.51%, and 3.08% on the CIFAR100 dataset with ShuffleNet V2, PreActResNet-50, ResNet-50, and SeNet-50 models respectively.

In this paper, for the first time, we study the transferability of pre-trained models based on synthetic data generated by graphics simulators to downstream tasks from very different domains. In using such synthetic data for pre-training, we find that downstream performance on different tasks are favored by different configurations of simulation parameters (e.g. lighting, object pose, backgrounds, etc.), and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It is thus better to tailor synthetic pre-training data to a specific downstream task, for best performance. We introduce Task2Sim, a unified model mapping downstream task representations to optimal simulation parameters to generate synthetic pre-training data for them. Task2Sim learns this mapping by training to find the set of best parameters on a set of \"seen\" tasks. Once trained, it can then be used to predict best simulation parameters for novel \"unseen\" tasks in one shot, without requiring additional training. Given a budget in number of images per class, our extensive experiments with 20 diverse downstream tasks show Task2Sim's task-adaptive pre-training data results in significantly better downstream performance than non-adaptively choosing simulation parameters on both seen and unseen tasks. It is even competitive with pre-training on real images from Imagenet."}

However, existing learning-based methods have two major defects. Firstly, networks with self-attention usually sacrifice internal resolution to balance model performance against complexity, losing fine-grained high-resolution (HR) features. Secondly, even if the optimization focusing on spatial-spectral domain learning (SDL) converges to the ideal solution, there is still a significant visual difference between the reconstructed HSI and the truth. So we propose a high-resolution dual-domain learning network (HDNet) for HSI reconstruction. On the one hand, the proposed HR spatial-spectral attention module with its efficient feature fusion provides continuous and fine pixel-level features. On the other hand, frequency domain learning (FDL) is introduced for HSI reconstruction to narrow the frequency domain discrepancy. Dynamic FDL supervision forces the model to reconstruct fine-grained frequencies and compensate for excessive smoothing and distortion caused by pixel-level losses. The HR pixel-level attention and frequency-level refinement in our HDNet mutually promote HSI perceptual quality. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method achieves SOTA performance on simulated and real HSI datasets. https://github.com/Huxiaowan/HDNet"}

Additionally, the model must incrementally learn new classes that become known in the next training episodes. Distinct from standard object detection, the OWOD setting poses significant challenges for generating quality candidate proposals on potentially unknown objects, separating the unknown objects from the background and detecting diverse unknown objects. Here, we introduce a novel end-to-end transformer-based framework, OW-DETR, for open-world object detection. The proposed OW-DETR comprises three dedicated components namely, attention-driven pseudo-labeling, novelty classification and objectness scoring to explicitly address the aforementioned OWOD challenges. Our OW-DETR explicitly encodes multi-scale contextual information, possesses less inductive bias, enables knowledge transfer from known classes to the unknown class and can better discriminate between unknown objects and background. Comprehensive experiments are performed on two benchmarks: MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC. The extensive ablations reveal the merits of our proposed contributions. Further, our model outperforms the recently introduced OWOD approach, ORE, with absolute gains ranging from 1.8% to 3.3% in terms of unknown recall on MS-COCO. In the case of incremental object detection, OW-DETR outperforms the state-of-the-art for all settings on PASCAL VOC. Our code is available at https://github.com/akshitac8/OW-DETR."}

Recently, some studies adopt adversarial examples to protect photos from being identified by unauthorized face recognition systems. However, existing methods of generating adversarial face images suffer from many limitations, such as awkward visual, white-box setting, weak transferability, making them difficult to be applied to protect face privacy in reality. In this paper, we propose adversarial makeup transfer GAN (AMT-GAN), a novel face protection method aiming at constructing adversarial face images that preserve stronger black-box transferability and better visual quality simultaneously. AMT-GAN leverages generative adversarial networks (GAN) to synthesize adversarial face images with makeup transferred from reference images. In particular, we introduce a new regularization module along with a joint training strategy to reconcile the conflicts between the adversarial noises and the cycle consistence loss in makeup transfer, achieving a desirable balance between the attack strength and visual changes. Extensive experiments verify that compared with state of the arts, AMT-GAN can not only preserve a comfortable visual quality, but also achieve a higher attack success rate over commercial FR APIs, including Face++, Aliyun, and Microsoft."}

We propose Potential functions for ObjectGoal Navigation with Interaction-free learning (PONI), a modular approach that disentangles the skills of 'where to look?' for an object and 'how to navigate to (x, y)?'. Our key insight is that 'where to look?' can be treated purely as a perception problem, and learned without environment interactions. To address this, we propose a network that predicts two complementary potential functions conditioned on a semantic map and uses them to decide where to look for an unseen object. We train the potential function network using supervised learning on a passive dataset of top-down semantic maps, and integrate it into a modular framework to perform ObjectNav. Experiments on Gibson and Matterport3D demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art for ObjectNav while incurring up to 1,600x less computational cost for training.

Recent popular methods for training DNNs with noisy labels mainly focus on directly filtering out samples with low confidence or repeatedly mining valuable information from low-confident samples. %to further modify DNNs. However, they cannot guarantee the robust generalization of models due to the ignorance of useful information hidden in noisy data. To address this issue, we propose a new effective method named as LaCoL (Latent Contrastive Learning) to leverage the negative correlations from the noisy data. Specifically, in label space, we exploit the weakly-augmented data to filter samples and adopt classification loss on strong augmentations of the selected sample set, which can preserve the training diversity. While in metric space, we utilize weakly-supervised contrastive learning to excavate these negative correlations hidden in noisy data. Moreover, a cross-space similarity consistency regularization is provided to constrain the gap between label space and metric space. Extensive experiments have validated the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods."}

In this paper, we explore more challenging exemplar-based high-resolution portrait style transfer by introducing a novel DualStyleGAN with flexible control of dual styles of the original face domain and the extended artistic portrait domain. Different from StyleGAN, DualStyleGAN provides a natural way of style transfer by characterizing the content and style of a portrait with an intrinsic style path and a new extrinsic style path, respectively. The delicately designed extrinsic style path enables our model to modulate both the color and complex structural styles hierarchically to precisely pastiche the style example. Furthermore, a novel progressive fine-tuning scheme is introduced to smoothly transform the generative space of the model to the target domain, even with the above modifications on the network architecture. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of DualStyleGAN over state-of-the-art methods in high-quality portrait style transfer and flexible style control."}

Previous works either apply spherical texture maps which may lead to large distortions, or use continuous texture fields that yield smooth outputs lacking details. We argue that the traditional way of representing textures with images and linking them to a 3D mesh via UV mapping is more desirable, since synthesizing 2D images is a well-studied problem. We propose AUV-Net which learns to embed 3D surfaces into a 2D aligned UV space, by mapping the corresponding semantic parts of different 3D shapes to the same location in the UV space. As a result, textures are aligned across objects, and can thus be easily synthesized by generative models of images. Texture alignment is learned in an unsupervised manner by a simple yet effective texture alignment module, taking inspiration from traditional works on linear subspace learning. The learned UV mapping and aligned texture representations enable a variety of applications including texture transfer, texture synthesis, and textured single view 3D reconstruction. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}

Particularly, instead of using difficult-to-obtain large sets of 3D models, we demonstrate that geometrically-motivated energy functions can be used to effectively augment and boost only a sparse collection of example (training) models. Technically, we analyze the Hessian of the as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) energy to adaptively sample from and project to the underlying (local) shape space, and use the augmented dataset to train a variational autoencoder (VAE). We iterate the process, of building latent spaces of VAE and augmenting the associated dataset, to progressively reveal a richer and more expressive generative space for creating geometrically and semantically valid samples. We evaluate our method against a set of strong baselines, provide ablation studies, and demonstrate application towards establishing shape correspondences.

Compared to explicit template meshes, neural implicit body representations provide an efficient mechanism for modeling interactions with the environment, which is essential for human motion reconstruction and synthesis in 3D scenes. However, existing neural implicit bodies suffer from either poor generalization on highly articulated poses or slow inference time. In this work, we observe that prior knowledge about the human body's shape and kinematic structure can be leveraged to improve generalization and efficiency. We decompose the full-body geometry into local body parts and employ a part-aware encoder-decoder architecture to learn neural articulated occupancy that models complex deformations locally. Our local shape encoder represents the body deformation of not only the corresponding body part but also the neighboring body parts. The decoder incorporates the geometric constraints of local body shape which significantly improves pose generalization. We demonstrate that our model is suitable for resolving self-intersections and collisions with 3D environments. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method largely outperforms existing solutions in terms of both efficiency and accuracy."}

This simplicity bias can explain their lack of robustness out of distribution (OOD). The more complex the task to learn, the more likely it is that statistical artifacts (i.e. selection biases, spurious correlations) are simpler than the mechanisms to learn. We demonstrate that the simplicity bias can be mitigated and OOD generalization improved. We train a set of similar models to fit the data in different ways using a penalty on the alignment of their input gradients. We show theoretically and empirically that this induces the learning of more complex predictive patterns. OOD generalization fundamentally requires information beyond i.i.d. examples, such as multiple training environments, counterfactual examples, or other side information. Our approach shows that we can defer this requirement to an independent model selection stage. We obtain SOTA results in visual recognition on biased data and generalization across visual domains. The method - the first to evade the simplicity bias - highlights the need for a better understanding and control of inductive biases in deep learning."}

First, we transform an image into a latent tensor using an analysis network. Then, we represent the latent tensor in ternary digits (trits) and encode it into a compressed bitstream trit-plane by trit-plane in the decreasing order of significance. Moreover, within each trit-plane, we sort the trits according to their rate-distortion priorities and transmit more important information first. Since the compression network is less optimized for the cases of using fewer trit-planes, we develop a postprocessing network for refining reconstructed images at low rates. Experimental results show that DPICT outperforms conventional progressive codecs significantly, while enabling FGS transmission. Codes are available at https://github.com/jaehanlee-mcl/DPICT."}

Although these two representations have recently demonstrated their excellent performance, they still have apparent shortcomings, e.g., regression methods tend to overfit due to the indirect learning cost volume, and classification methods cannot directly infer the exact depth due to its discrete prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel representation, termed Unification, to unify the advantages of regression and classification. It can directly constrain the cost volume like classification methods, but also realize the sub-pixel depth prediction like regression methods. To excavate the potential of unification, we design a new loss function named Unified Focal Loss, which is more uniform and reasonable to combat the challenge of sample imbalance. Combining these two unburdened modules, we present a coarse-to-fine framework, that we call UniMVSNet. The results of ranking first on both DTU and Tanks and Temples benchmarks verify that our model not only performs the best but also has the best generalization ability."}

Current approaches usually require a large amount of labeled or unlabeled data from the shifted domain. This can be a hurdle in fields which require continuous dynamic adaptation or suffer from scarcity of data, e.g. autonomous driving in challenging weather conditions. To address this problem of continuous adaptation to distribution shifts, we propose Dynamic Unsupervised Adaptation (DUA). By continuously adapting the statistics of the batch normalization layers we modify the feature representations of the model. We show that by sequentially adapting a model with only a fraction of unlabeled data, a strong performance gain can be achieved. With even less than 1% of unlabeled data from the target domain, DUA already achieves competitive results to strong baselines. In addition, the computational overhead is minimal in contrast to previous approaches. Our approach is simple, yet effective and can be applied to any architecture which uses batch normalization as one of its components. We show the utility of DUA by evaluating it on a variety of domain adaptation datasets and tasks including object recognition, digit recognition and object detection."}

To facilitate the use of transformers for 3D, we introduce a compact 3D representation, vector quantized deep implicit function (VQDIF), that utilizes spatial sparsity to represent a close approximation of a 3D shape by a short sequence of discrete variables. Experiments demonstrate that ShapeFormer outperforms prior art for shape completion from ambiguous partial inputs in terms of both completion quality and diversity. We also show that our approach effectively handles a variety of shape types, incomplete patterns, and real-world scans."}

These other goals include out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, prediction consistency, resilience to adversaries, calibrated uncertainty estimates, and the ability to detect anomalous inputs. However, improving performance towards these goals is often a balancing act that today's methods cannot achieve without sacrificing performance on other safety axes. For instance, adversarial training improves adversarial robustness but sharply degrades other classifier performance metrics. Similarly, strong data augmentation and regularization techniques often improve OOD robustness but harm anomaly detection, raising the question of whether a Pareto improvement on all existing safety measures is possible. To meet this challenge, we design a new data augmentation strategy utilizing the natural structural complexity of pictures such as fractals, which outperforms numerous baselines, is near Pareto-optimal, and roundly improves safety measures."}

As an alternative, interpolating low-FPS videos from commodity cameras has attracted significant attention. If only low-FPS videos are available, motion assumptions (linear or quadratic) are necessary to infer intermediate frames, which fail to model complex motions. Event camera, a new camera with pixels producing events of brightness change at the temporal resolution of \\mu s (10^ -6  second ), is a game-changing device to enable video interpolation at the presence of arbitrarily complex motion. Since event camera is a novel sensor, its potential has not been fulfilled due to the lack of processing algorithms. The pioneering work Time Lens introduced event cameras to video interpolation by designing optical devices to collect a large amount of paired training data of high-speed frames and events, which is too costly to scale. To fully unlock the potential of event cameras, this paper proposes a novel TimeReplayer algorithm to interpolate videos captured by commodity cameras with events. It is trained in an unsupervised cycle-consistent style, canceling the necessity of high-speed training data and bringing the additional ability of video extrapolation. Its state-of-the-art results and demo videos in supplementary reveal the promising future of event-based vision."}

Since ground truth depth is readily available in the simulation domain but quite difficult to obtain in the real domain, we propose a method that leverages the best of both worlds. In this paper we present a new framework, ActiveZero, which is a mixed domain learning solution for active stereovision systems that requires no real world depth annotation. First, we demonstrate the transferability of our method to out-of-distribution real data by using a mixed domain learning strategy. In the simulation domain, we use a combination of supervised disparity loss and self-supervised losses on a shape primitives dataset. By contrast, in the real domain, we only use self-supervised losses on a dataset that is out-of-distribution from either training simulation data or test real data. Second, our method introduces a novel self-supervised loss called temporal IR reprojection to increase the robustness and accuracy of our reprojections in hard-to-perceive regions. Finally, we show how the method can be trained end-to-end and that each module is important for attaining the end result. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on real data demonstrate state of the art results that can even beat a commercial depth sensor."}

However, the good performance of transformers heavily depends on enormous training images. Thus, a data-efficient transformer solution is urgently needed. In this work, we propose an early knowledge distillation framework, which is termed as DearKD, to improvethe data-efficiency required by transformers. Our DearKD is a two-stage framework that first distills the inductive biases from the early intermediate layers of a CNN and then gives the transformer full play by training without distillation. Further, our DearKD can also be applied to the extreme data-free case where no real images are available, where we propose a boundary-preserving intra-divergence loss based on DeepInversion to further close the performance gap against the full-data counterpart. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, partial ImageNet, data-free setting and other downstream tasks prove the superiority of DearKD over its baselines and state-of-the-art methods."}

Due to the high computation and memory consumption of 3D CNN, the resolution of output depth is often considerably limited. Different from most existing works dedicated to adaptive refinement of cost volumes, we opt to directly optimize the depth value along each camera ray, mimicking the range (depth) finding of a laser scanner. This reduces the MVS problem to ray-based depth optimization which is much more light-weight than full cost volume optimization. In particular, we propose RayMVSNet which learns sequential prediction of a 1D implicit field along each camera ray with the zero-crossing point indicating scene depth. This sequential modeling, conducted based on transformer features, essentially learns the epipolar line search in traditional multi-view stereo. We also devise a multi-task learning for better optimization convergence and depth accuracy.

The key to addressing this task is to build an effective class-agnostic mask segmentation model. Unlike previous methods that learn such models only on base categories, in this paper, we propose a new method, named ContrastMask, which learns a mask segmentation model on both base and novel categories under a unified pixel-level contrastive learning framework. In this framework, annotated masks of base categories and pseudo masks of novel categories serve as a prior for contrastive learning, where features from the mask regions (foreground) are pulled together, and are contrasted against those from the background, and vice versa. Through this framework, feature discrimination between foreground and background is largely improved, facilitating learning of the class-agnostic mask segmentation model. Exhaustive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method, which outperforms previous state-of-the-arts."}

In this work, we focus on exploiting the high-precision and non-differentiable physics simulator to incorporate dynamical constraints in motion capture. Our key-idea is to use real physical supervisions to train a target pose distribution prior for sampling-based motion control to capture physically plausible human motion. To obtain accurate reference motion with terrain interactions for the sampling, we first introduce an interaction constraint based on SDF (Signed Distance Field) to enforce appropriate ground contact modeling. We then design a novel two-branch decoder to avoid stochastic error from pseudo ground-truth and train a distribution prior with the non-differentiable physics simulator. Finally, we regress the sampling distribution from the current state of the physical character with the trained prior and sample satisfied target poses to track the estimated reference motion. Qualitative and quantitative results show that we can obtain physically plausible human motion with complex terrain interactions, human shape variations, and diverse behaviors.

However, due to the tiny memory constraint in IoT/edge devices, such on-device learning requires ultra-small training memory footprint, bringing new challenges for memory-efficient learning. Many existing works solve this problem by reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, this doesn't directly translate to memory-saving since the major bottleneck is the activations, not parameters. To develop memory-efficient on-device transfer learning, in this work, we are the first to approach the concept of transfer learning from a new perspective of intermediate feature reprogramming of a pre-trained model (i.e., backbone). To perform this lightweight and memory-efficient reprogramming, we propose to train a tiny Reprogramming Network (Rep-Net) directly from the new task input data, while freezing the backbone model. The proposed Rep-Net model interchanges the features with the backbone model using an activation connector at regular intervals to mutually benefit both the backbone model and Rep-Net model features. Through extensive experiments, we validate each design specs of the proposed Rep-Net model in achieving highly memory-efficient on-device reprogramming.

The resulting network contains less than 4M parameters while demonstrating excellent performance on the challenging T-LESS and Occluded LINEMOD datasets without any dataset-specific training.

Labeled real data of occlusions is scarce (even in large datasets) and synthetic data leaves a domain gap, making it hard to explicitly model and learn occlusions. In this work, we present the best of both the real and synthetic worlds for automatic occlusion supervision using a large readily available source of data: time-lapse imagery from stationary webcams observing street intersections over weeks, months, or even years. We introduce a new dataset, Watch and Learn Time-lapse (WALT), consisting of 12 (4K and 1080p) cameras capturing urban environments over a year. We exploit this real data in a novel way to automatically mine a large set of unoccluded objects and then composite them in the same views to generate occlusions. This longitudinal self-supervision is strong enough for an amodal network to learn object-occluder-occluded layer representations. We show how to speed up the discovery of unoccluded objects and relate the confidence in this discovery to the rate and accuracy of training occluded objects. After watching and automatically learning for several days, this approach shows significant performance improvement in detecting and segmenting occluded people and vehicles, over human-supervised amodal approaches."}

Quite intuitively, pioneering two-stage based methods complete ST-VSR directly combining two sub-tasks: Spatial Video Super-Resolution (S-VSR) and Temporal Video Super-Resolution (T-VSR) but ignore the reciprocal relations among them. Specifically, 1) T-VSR to S-VSR: temporal correlations help accurate spatial detail representation with more clues; 2) S-VSR to T-VSR: abundant spatial information contributes to the refinement of temporal prediction. To this end, we propose a one-stage based Cycle-projected Mutual learning network (CycMu-Net) for ST-VSR, which makes full use of spatial-temporal correlations via the mutual learning between S-VSR and T-VSR. Specifically, we propose to exploit the mutual information among them via iterative up-and-down projections, where the spatial and temporal features are fully fused and distilled, helping the high-quality video reconstruction. Besides extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we also compare our proposed CycMu-Net with S-VSR and T-VSR tasks, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

By considering extracted content features from an image as tokens, our networks discover global consensus of content features by considering context information through a self-attention module in Transformers. By augmenting such tokens with an instance-level feature extracted from the content feature with respect to bounding box information, our framework is capable of learning an interaction between object instances and the global image, thus boosting the instance-awareness. We replace layer normalization (LayerNorm) in standard Transformers with adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) to enable a multi-modal translation with style codes. In addition, to improve the instance-awareness and translation quality at object regions, we present an instance-level content contrastive loss defined between input and translated image. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our InstaFormer over the latest methods and provide extensive ablation studies."}

However, in safety-critical settings, robustness to out-of-domain and long-tail samples is fundamental to circumvent dangerous issues, such as the misdetection of damaged or rare cars. In this work, we substantially improve the generalization of 3D object detectors to out-of-domain data by deforming point clouds during training. We achieve this with 3D-VField: a novel data augmentation method that plausibly deforms objects via vector fields learned in an adversarial fashion. Our approach constrains 3D points to slide along their sensor view rays while neither adding nor removing any of them. The obtained vectors are transferable, sample-independent and preserve shape and occlusions. Despite training only on a standard dataset, such as KITTI, augmenting with our vector fields significantly improves the generalization to differently shaped objects and scenes. Towards this end, we propose and share CrashD: a synthetic dataset of realistic damaged and rare cars, with a variety of crash scenarios. Extensive experiments on KITTI, Waymo, our CrashD and SUN RGB-D show the generalizability of our techniques to out-of-domain data, different models and sensors, namely LiDAR and ToF cameras, for both indoor and outdoor scenes.

Classic solutions usually decompose the VPS task into several sub-tasks and utilize multiple surrogates (e.g. boxes and masks, centers and offsets) to represent objects. However, this divide-and-conquer strategy requires complex post-processing in both spatial and temporal domains and is vulnerable to failures from surrogate tasks. In this paper, inspired by object-centric learning which learns compact and robust object representations, we present Slot-VPS, the first end-to-end framework for this task. We encode all panoptic entities in a video, including both foreground instances and background semantics, in a unified representation called panoptic slots. The coherent spatio-temporal object's information is retrieved and encoded into the panoptic slots by the proposed Video Panoptic Retriever, enabling to localize, segment, differentiate, and associate objects in a unified manner. Finally, the output panoptic slots can be directly converted into the class, mask, and object ID of panoptic objects in the video. We conduct extensive ablation studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmark datasets, Cityscapes-VPS (val and test sets) and VIPER (val set), achieving new state-of-the-art performance of 63.7, 63.3 and 56.2 VPQ, respectively."}

To this end, we model the blurred appearance of a fast moving object in a generative fashion by parametrizing its 3D position, rotation, velocity, acceleration, bounces, shape, and texture over the duration of a predefined time window spanning multiple frames. Using differentiable rendering, we are able to estimate all parameters by minimizing the pixel-wise reprojection error to the input video via backpropagating through a rendering pipeline that accounts for motion blur by averaging the graphics output over short time intervals. For that purpose, we also estimate the camera exposure gap time within the same optimization. To account for abrupt motion changes like bounces, we model the motion trajectory as a piece-wise polynomial, and we are able to estimate the specific time of the bounce at sub-frame accuracy. Experiments on established benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods for fast moving object deblurring and 3D reconstruction."}

Existing methods focus on performing repetitive action counting in short videos, which is tough for dealing with longer videos in more realistic scenarios. In the data-driven era, the degradation of such generalization capability is mainly attributed to the lack of long video datasets. To complement this margin, we introduce a new large-scale repetitive action counting dataset covering a wide variety of video lengths, along with more realistic situations where action interruption or action inconsistencies occur in the video. Besides, we also provide a fine-grained annotation of the action cycles instead of just counting annotation along with a numerical value. Such a dataset contains 1,451 videos with about 20,000 annotations, which is more challenging. For repetitive action counting towards more realistic scenarios, we further propose encoding multi-scale temporal correlation with transformers that can take into account both performance and efficiency. Furthermore, with the help of fine-grained annotation of action cycles, we propose a density map regression-based method to predict the action period, which yields better performance with sufficient interpretability. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all datasets and also achieves better performance on the unseen dataset without fine-tuning. The dataset and code are available."}

However, existing monocular hair modeling methods are either tricky to deploy in digital systems (e.g., due to their dependence on complex user interactions or large databases) or can produce only a coarse geometry. In this paper, we introduce NeuralHDHair, a flexible, fully automatic system for modeling high-fidelity hair from a single image. The key enablers of our system are two carefully designed neural networks: an IRHairNet (Implicit representation for hair using neural network) for inferring high-fidelity 3D hair geometric features (3D orientation field and 3D occupancy field) hierarchically and a GrowingNet (Growing hair strands using neural network) to efficiently generate 3D hair strands in parallel. Specifically, we perform a coarse-to-fine manner and propose a novel voxel-aligned implicit function (VIFu) to represent the global hair feature, which is further enhanced by the local details extracted from a hair luminance map. To improve the efficiency of a traditional hair growth algorithm, we adopt a local neural implicit function to grow strands based on the estimated 3D hair geometric features. Extensive experiments show that our method is capable of constructing a high-fidelity 3D hair model from a single image, both efficiently and effectively, and achieves the-state-of-the-art performance."}

To alleviate this, the state-of-the-art framework RAFT gradually improves its prediction quality by using a large number of iterative refinements, achieving remarkable performance but introducing linearly increasing inference time. To enable both high accuracy and efficiency, we completely revamp the dominant flow regression pipeline by reformulating optical flow as a global matching problem, which identifies the correspondences by directly comparing feature similarities. Specifically, we propose a GMFlow framework, which consists of three main components: a customized Transformer for feature enhancement, a correlation and softmax layer for global feature matching, and a self-attention layer for flow propagation. We further introduce a refinement step that reuses GMFlow at higher feature resolution for residual flow prediction. Our new framework outperforms 31-refinements RAFT on the challenging Sintel benchmark, while using only one refinement and running faster, suggesting a new paradigm for accurate and efficient optical flow estimation.

To be understandable and accepted by the deaf, an automatic SLP system must be able to generate co-articulated photo-realistic signing sequences for large domains of discourse. In this work, we tackle large-scale SLP by learning to co-articulate between dictionary signs, a method capable of producing smooth signing while scaling to unconstrained domains of discourse. To learn sign co-articulation, we propose a novel Frame Selection Network (FS-Net) that improves the temporal alignment of interpolated dictionary signs to continuous signing sequences. Additionally, we propose SignGAN, a pose-conditioned human synthesis model that produces photo-realistic sign language videos direct from skeleton pose. We propose a novel keypoint-based loss function which improves the quality of synthesized hand images. We evaluate our SLP model on the large-scale meineDGS (mDGS) corpus, conducting extensive user evaluation showing our FS-Net approach improves co-articulation of interpolated dictionary signs.

Thus, we construct an IOD-Video dataset comprised of 600 videos (141,017 frames) covering various distances, sizes, visibility, and scenes captured by different spectral ranges. In addition, we develop a spatio-temporal aggregation framework for IOD, in which differ-ent backbones are deployed and a spatio-temporal aggregation loss (STAloss) is elaborately designed to leverage the consistency along the time axis.

Seeking a compact yet effective video representation, e.g., sample informative frames from the entire video, is critical to efficient video recognition. There have been works that formulate frame sampling as a sequential decision task by selecting frames one by one according to their importance. In this paper, we present a more efficient framework named OCSampler, which explores such a representation with one short clip. OCSampler designs a new paradigm of learning instance-specific video condensation policies to select frames only in a single step. Rather than picking up frames sequentially like previous methods, we simply process a whole sequence at once. Accordingly, these policies are derived from a light-weighted skim network together with a simple yet effective policy network. Moreover, we extend the proposed method with a frame number budget, enabling the framework to produce correct predictions in high confidence with as few frames as possible. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of OCSampler over previous methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, it achieves 76.9% mAP and 21.7 GFLOPs on ActivityNet with an impressive throughput: 123.9 Video/s on a single TITAN Xp GPU."}

Unfortunately, tables come in a large variety of shapes and sizes. Furthermore, they can have complex column/row-header configurations, multiline rows, different variety of separation lines, missing entries, etc. As such, the correct identification of the table-structure from an image is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we present a new table-structure identification model. The latter improves the latest end-to-end deep learning model (i.e. encoder-dual-decoder from PubTabNet) in two significant ways. First, we introduce a new object detection decoder for table-cells. In this way, we can obtain the content of the table-cells from programmatic PDF's directly from the PDF source and avoid the training of the custom OCR decoders. This architectural change leads to more accurate table-content extraction and allows us to tackle non-english tables. Second, we replace the LSTM decoders with transformer based decoders.

Previous works have made efforts to learn image-adaptive output color values of LUTs for flexible enhancement but neglect the importance of sampling strategy. They adopt a sub-optimal uniform sampling point allocation, limiting the expressiveness of the learned LUTs since the (tri-)linear interpolation between uniform sampling points in the LUT transform might fail to model local non-linearities of the color transform. Focusing on this problem, we present AdaInt (Adaptive Intervals Learning), a novel mechanism to achieve a more flexible sampling point allocation by adaptively learning the non-uniform sampling intervals in the 3D color space. In this way, a 3D LUT can increase its capability by conducting dense sampling in color ranges requiring highly non-linear transforms and sparse sampling for near-linear transforms. The proposed AdaInt could be implemented as a compact and efficient plug-and-play module for a 3D LUT-based method. To enable the end-to-end learning of AdaInt, we design a novel differentiable operator called AiLUT-Transform (Adaptive Interval LUT Transform) to locate input colors in the non-uniform 3D LUT and provide gradients to the sampling intervals. Experiments demonstrate that methods equipped with AdaInt can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two public benchmark datasets with a negligible overhead increase.

However, existing point Transformers are computationally expensive since they need to generate a large attention map, which has quadratic complexity (both in space and time) with respect to input size. To solve this shortcoming, we introduce patch-attention (PAT) to adaptively learn a much smaller set of bases upon which the attention maps are computed. By a weighted summation upon these bases, PAT not only captures the global shape context but also achieves linear complexity to input size. In addition, we propose a lightweight Multi-Scale Attention (MST) block to build attentions among features of different scales, providing the model with multi-scale features. Equipped with the PAT and MST, we construct our neural architecture called PatchFormer that integrates both modules into a joint framework for point cloud learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network achieves comparable accuracy on general point cloud learning tasks with 9.2x speed-up than previous point Transformers."}

We have simplified recently proposed relevant approaches, without the need for special designs, such as block-wise masking and tokenization via discrete VAE or clustering. To investigate what makes a masked image modeling task learn good representations, we systematically study the major components in our framework, and find that the simple designs of each component have revealed very strong representation learning performance: 1) random masking of the input image with a moderately large masked patch size (e.g., 32) makes a powerful pre-text task; 2) predicting RGB values of raw pixels by direct regression performs no worse than the patch classification approaches with complex designs; 3) the prediction head can be as light as a linear layer, with no worse performance than heavier ones. Using ViT-B, our approach achieves 83.8% top-1 fine-tuning accuracy on ImageNet-1K by pre-training also on this dataset, surpassing previous best approach by +0.6%.

In dense regression tasks such as depth estimation, where structural details are required, using a vanilla CNN layer on the distorted 360 image results in undesired information loss.

Our pipeline transforms a 360 image into less-distorted perspective patches (i.e. tangent images) to obtain patch-wise predictions via CNN, and then merge the patch-wise results for final output. To handle the discrepancy between patch-wise predictions which is a major issue affecting the merging quality, we propose a new framework with the following key components. First, we propose a geometry-aware feature fusion mechanism that combines 3D geometric features with 2D image features to compensate for the patch-wise discrepancy. Second, we employ the self-attention-based transformer architecture to conduct a global aggregation of patch-wise information, which further improves the consistency. Last, we introduce an iterative depth refinement mechanism, to further refine the estimated depth based on the more accurate geometric features.

To mitigate this issue, we propose a new method called RegionCLIP that significantly extends CLIP to learn region-level visual representations, thus enabling fine-grained alignment between image regions and textual concepts. Our method leverages a CLIP model to match image regions with template captions, and then pretrains our model to align these region-text pairs in the feature space.

Existing works mainly rely on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) derived from a classification model. However, CAM-based methods usually focus on the most discriminative parts of an object (i.e., incomplete localization problem). In this paper, we empirically prove that this problem is associated with the mixup of the activation values between less discriminative foreground regions and the background. To address it, we propose Class RE-Activation Mapping (CREAM), a novel clustering-based approach to boost the activation values of the integral object regions. To this end, we introduce class-specific foreground and background context embeddings as cluster centroids. A CAM-guided momentum preservation strategy is developed to learn the context embeddings during training. At the inference stage, the re-activation mapping is formulated as a parameter estimation problem under Gaussian Mixture Model, which can be solved by deriving an unsupervised Expectation-Maximization based soft-clustering algorithm.

In this paper, we introduce a visual hallucination framework, called VALHALLA, which requires only source sentences at inference time and instead uses hallucinated visual representations for multimodal machine translation. In particular, given a source sentence an autoregressive hallucination transformer is used to predict a discrete visual representation from the input text, and the combined text and hallucinated representations are utilized to obtain the target translation. We train the hallucination transformer jointly with the translation transformer using standard backpropagation with cross-entropy losses while being guided by an additional loss that encourages consistency between predictions using either ground-truth or hallucinated visual representations.

Our method is trained on single view RGB data only, and stands on the shoulders of StyleGAN2 for image generation, while solving two main challenges in 3D-aware GANs: 1) high-resolution, view-consistent generation of the RGB images, and 2) detailed 3D shape. We achieve this by merging an SDF-based 3D representation with a style-based 2D generator. Our 3D implicit network renders low-resolution feature maps, from which the style-based network generates view-consistent, 1024x1024 images. Notably, our SDF-based 3D modeling defines detailed 3D surfaces, leading to consistent volume rendering. Our method shows higher quality results compared to state of the art in terms of visual and geometric quality."}

Our approach is robust to severe and long-term occlusions and tracks human bodies even when they go outside the camera's field of view. To achieve this, we first propose a deep generative motion infiller, which autoregressively infills the body motions of occluded humans based on visible motions. Additionally, in contrast to prior work, our approach reconstructs human meshes in consistent global coordinates even with dynamic cameras. Since the joint reconstruction of human motions and camera poses is underconstrained, we propose a global trajectory predictor that generates global human trajectories based on local body movements. Using the predicted trajectories as anchors, we present a global optimization framework that refines the predicted trajectories and optimizes the camera poses to match the video evidence such as 2D keypoints. Experiments on challenging indoor and in-the-wild datasets with dynamic cameras demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms prior methods significantly in terms of motion infilling and global mesh recovery."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2022", "Area": "CV", "Where": "CVPR", "Abbreviation": "HINT", "Title": "Hierarchical Neuron Concept Explainer", "Abstract": "To interpret deep networks, one main approach is to associate neurons with human-understandable concepts. However, existing methods often ignore the inherent connections of different concepts (e.g., dog and cat both belong to animals), and thus lose the chance to explain neurons responsible for higher-level concepts (e.g., animal). In this paper, we study hierarchical concepts inspired by the hierarchical cognition process of human beings. To this end, we propose HIerarchical Neuron concepT explainer (HINT) to effectively build bidirectional associations between neurons and hierarchical concepts in a low-cost and scalable manner. HINT enables us to systematically and quantitatively study whether and how the implicit hierarchical relationships of concepts are embedded into neurons. Specifically, HINT identifies collaborative neurons responsible for one concept and multimodal neurons pertinent to different concepts, at different semantic levels from concrete concepts (e.g., dog) to more abstract ones (e.g., animal). Finally, we verify the faithfulness of the associations using Weakly Supervised Object Localization, and demonstrate its applicability in various tasks, such as discovering saliency regions and explaining adversarial attacks.

Due to the absence of unseen training samples, the classifier tends to bias towards seen classes. To mitigate this problem, feature generation based models are proposed to synthesize visual features for unseen classes. However, these features are generated in the visual feature space which lacks of discriminative ability. Therefore, some methods turn to find a better embedding space for the classifier training. They emphasize the inter-class relationships of seen classes, leading the embedding space overfitted to seen classes and unfriendly to unseen classes. Instead, in this paper, we propose an Intra-Class Compactness Enhancement method (ICCE) for GZSL. Our ICCE promotes intra-class compactness with inter-class separability on both seen and unseen classes in the embedding space and visual feature space. By promoting the intra-class relationships but the inter-class structures, we can distinguish different classes with better generalization. Specifically, we propose a Self-Distillation Embedding (SDE) module and a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Generation (SVCG) module. The former promotes intra-class compactness in the embedding space, while the latter accomplishes it in the visual feature space. The experiments demonstrate that our ICCE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four datasets and achieves competitive results on the remaining dataset."}

However, these methods do not consider the performance drop in the high-frequency region, giving equal consideration to the low and high-frequency areas. In this paper, we propose a new lossless image compression method that proceeds the encoding in a coarse-to-fine manner to separate and process low and high-frequency regions differently. We initially compress the low-frequency components and then use them as additional input for encoding the remaining high-frequency region. The low-frequency components act as a strong prior in this case, which leads to improved estimation in the high-frequency area. In addition, we design the frequency decomposition process to be adaptive to color channel, spatial location, and image characteristics. As a result, our method derives an image-specific optimal ratio of low/high-frequency components. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance for benchmark high-resolution datasets."}

However, many nonuniform quantization methods overlook the complicated projection process in implementing the nonuniformly quantized weights/activations, which incurs non-negligible time and space overhead in hardware deployment. In this study, we propose Nonuniform-to-Uniform Quantization (N2UQ), a method that can maintain the strong representation ability of nonuniform methods while being hardware-friendly and efficient as the uniform quantization for model inference. We achieve this through learning the flexible in-equidistant input thresholds to better fit the underlying distribution while quantizing these real-valued inputs into equidistant output levels. To train the quantized network with learnable input thresholds, we introduce a generalized straight-through estimator (G-STE) for intractable backward derivative calculation w.r.t. threshold parameters. Additionally, we consider entropy preserving regularization to further reduce information loss in weight quantization. Even under this adverse constraint of imposing uniformly quantized weights and activations, our N2UQ outperforms state-of-the-art nonuniform quantization methods by 0.5 1.7% on ImageNet, demonstrating the contribution of N2UQ design.

To deal with this problem, existing image rectangling methods devote to searching an initial mesh and optimizing a target mesh to form the mesh deformation in two stages. Then rectangular images can be generated by warping stitched images. However, these solutions only work for images with rich linear structures, leading to noticeable distortions for portraits and landscapes with non-linear objects. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing the first deep learning solution to image rectangling. Concretely, we predefine a rigid target mesh and only estimate an initial mesh to form the mesh deformation, contributing to a compact one-stage solution. The initial mesh is predicted using a fully convolutional network with a residual progressive regression strategy. To obtain results with high content fidelity, a comprehensive objective function is proposed to simultaneously encourage the boundary rectangular, mesh shape-preserving, and content perceptually natural. Besides, we build the first image stitching rectangling dataset with a large diversity in irregular boundaries and scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority over traditional methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. The codes and dataset will be available."}

A promising solution is contrastive learning, which attempts to learn domain-invariant representations by exploiting rich semantic relations among sample-to-sample pairs from different domains. A simple approach is to pull positive sample pairs from different domains closer while pushing other negative pairs further apart. In this paper, we find that directly applying contrastive-based methods (e.g., supervised contrastive learning) are not effective in domain generalization. We argue that aligning positive sample-to-sample pairs tends to hinder the model generalization due to the significant distribution gaps between different domains. To address this issue, we propose a novel proxy-based contrastive learning method, which replaces the original sample-to-sample relations with proxy-to-sample relations, significantly alleviating the positive alignment issue. Experiments on the four standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we also consider a more complex scenario where no ImageNet pre-trained models are provided. Our method consistently shows better performance."}

The correspondence distributions are learnt with a contrastive loss, represented in object-specific latent spaces by an encoder-decoder query model and a small fully connected key model. Our method is unsupervised with respect to visual ambiguities, yet we show that the query- and key models learn to represent accurate multi-modal surface distributions.

We admire these progresses but are confused about the necessity: is there a simple method that can perform comparably well? This paper proposes SimVP, a simple video prediction model that is completely built upon CNN and trained by MSE loss in an end-to-end fashion. Without introducing any additional tricks and complicated strategies, we can achieve state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets. Through extended experiments, we demonstrate that SimVP has strong generalization and extensibility on real-world datasets. The significant reduction of training cost makes it easier to scale to complex scenarios. We believe SimVP can serve as a solid baseline to stimulate the further development of video prediction."}

That said, while in classical (i.e., non-deep) clustering the benefits of the nonparametric approach are well known, most deep-clustering methods are parametric: namely, they require a predefined and fixed number of clusters, denoted by K. When K is unknown, however, using model-selection criteria to choose its optimal value might become computationally expensive, especially in DL as the training process would have to be repeated numerous times. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an effective deep-clustering method that does not require knowing the value of K as it infers it during the learning. Using a split/merge framework, a dynamic architecture that adapts to the changing K, and a novel loss, our proposed method outperforms existing nonparametric methods (both classical and deep ones). While the very few existing deep nonparametric methods lack scalability, we demonstrate ours by being the first to report the performance of such a method on ImageNet. We also demonstrate the importance of inferring K by showing how methods that fix it deteriorate in performance when their assumed K value gets further from the ground-truth one, especially on imbalanced datasets.

Although explored by many previous works, there is still a gap between academic approaches and industrial needs: first, existing models are not efficient enough to work on low power devices; second, they perform poorly when used to refine preexisting masks as they could not avoid destroying the correct part. FocalClick solves both issues at once by predicting and updating the mask in localized areas. For higher efficiency, we decompose the slow prediction on the entire image into two fast inferences on small crops: a coarse segmentation on the Target Crop, and a local refinement on the Focus Crop. To make the model work with preexisting masks, we formulate a sub-task termed Interactive Mask Correction, and propose Progressive Merge as the solution. Progressive Merge exploits morphological information to decide where to preserve and where to update, enabling users to refine any preexisting mask effectively. FocalClick achieves competitive results against SOTA methods with significantly smaller FLOPs. It also shows significant superiority when making corrections on preexisting masks.

To tackle these issues, most of the previous works follow the global-local refinement pipeline, which pays more attention to the memory consumption but neglects the inference speed. In comparison to the pipeline that partitions the large image into small local regions, we focus on inferring the whole image directly. In this paper, we propose ISDNet, a novel ultra-high resolution segmentation framework that integrates the shallow and deep networks in a new manner, which significantly accelerates the inference speed while achieving accurate segmentation. To further exploit the relationship between the shallow and deep features, we propose a novel Relational-Aware feature Fusion module, which ensures high performance and robustness of our framework.

Second, the key-value pairs in ResotreFormer are sampled from a reconstruction-oriented high-quality dictionary, whose elements are rich in high-quality facial features specifically aimed for face reconstruction, leading to superior restoration results.

State-of-the-art approaches largely rely on learning the synthetic data by matching the gradients between the real and synthetic data batches. Despite the intuitive motivation and promising results, such gradient-based methods, by nature, easily overfit to a biased set of samples that produce dominant gradients, and thus lack a global supervision of data distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to Condense dataset by Aligning FEatures (CAFE), which explicitly attempts to preserve the real-feature distribution as well as the discriminant power of the resulting synthetic set, lending itself to strong generalization capability to various architectures. At the heart of our approach is an effective strategy to align features from the real and synthetic data across various scales, while accounting for the classification of real samples. Our scheme is further backed up by a novel dynamic bi-level optimization, which adaptively adjusts parameter updates to prevent over-/under-fitting. We validate the proposed CAFE across various datasets, and demonstrate that it generally outperforms the state of the art: on the SVHN dataset, for example, the performance gain is up to 11%. Extensive experiments and analysis verify the effectiveness and necessity of proposed designs."}

Existing replay-based methods have shown promising performance by storing a subset of old class data. Unfortunately, these methods only focus on selecting samples from the memory bank for replay and ignore the adequate exploration of semantic information in the single-pass data stream, leading to poor classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel yet effective framework for online class-incremental continual learning, which considers not only the selection of stored samples, but also the full exploration of the data stream. Specifically, we propose a gradient-based sample selection strategy, which selects the stored samples whose gradients generated in the network are most interfered by the new incoming samples. We believe such samples are beneficial for updating the neural network based on back gradient propagation. More importantly, we seek to explore the semantic information between two different views of training images by maximizing their mutual information, which is conducive to the improvement of classification accuracy.

However, the application value of SG on downstream tasks is severely limited by the predicate classification bias, which is caused by long-tailed data and presented as semantic bias of predicted relation predicates. Existing methods mainly reduce the prediction bias by better aggregating contexts and integrating external priori knowledge, but rarely take the semantic similarities between predicates into account. In this paper, we propose a Predicate Probability Distribution based Loss (PPDL) to train the biased SGG models and obtain unbiased Scene Graphs ultimately. Firstly, we propose a predicate probability distribution as the semantic representation of a particular predicate class. Afterwards, we re-balance the biased training loss according to the similarity between the predicted probability distribution and the estimated one, and eventually eliminate the long-tailed bias on predicate classification. Notably, the PPDL training method is model-agnostic, and extensive experiments and qualitative analyses on the Visual Genome dataset reveal significant performance improvements of our method on tail classes compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}

This decomposition decouples rendering time from scene size, enables rendering to scale to arbitrarily large environments, and allows per-block updates of the environment. We adopt several architectural changes to make NeRF robust to data captured over months under different environmental conditions. We add appearance embeddings, learned pose refinement, and controllable exposure to each individual NeRF, and introduce a procedure for aligning appearance between adjacent NeRFs so that they can be seamlessly combined.

For this, we propose to replace the linear transforms in DNNs by our B-cos transform. As we show, a sequence (network) of such transforms induces a single linear transform that faithfully summarises the full model computations. Moreover, the B-cos transform introduces alignment pressure on the weights during optimisation. As a result, those induced linear transforms become highly interpretable and align with task-relevant features. Importantly, the B-cos transform is designed to be compatible with existing architectures and we show that it can easily be integrated into common models such as VGGs, ResNets, InceptionNets, and DenseNets, whilst maintaining similar performance on ImageNet. The resulting explanations are of high visual quality and perform well under quantitative metrics for interpretability. Code available at github.com/moboehle/B-cos."}

Unfortunately, the best recent methods that regress parametric 3D face models from monocular images are unable to capture the full spectrum of facial expression, such as subtle or extreme emotions. We find the standard reconstruction metrics used for training (landmark reprojection error, photometric error, and face recognition loss) are insufficient to capture high-fidelity expressions. The result is facial geometries that do not match the emotional content of the input image. We address this with EMOCA (EMOtion Capture and Animation), by introducing a novel deep perceptual emotion consistency loss during training, which helps ensure that the reconstructed 3D expression matches the expression depicted in the input image. While EMOCA achieves 3D reconstruction errors that are on par with the current best methods, it significantly outperforms them in terms of the quality of the reconstructed expression and the perceived emotional content. We also directly regress levels of valence and arousal and classify basic expressions from the estimated 3D face parameters. On the task of in-the-wild emotion recognition, our purely geometric approach is on par with the best image-based methods, highlighting the value of 3D geometry in analyzing human behavior.

For applications in medical imaging, transfer from ImageNet has become the de-facto approach, despite differences in the tasks and image characteristics between the domains. However, it is unclear what factors determine whether - and to what extent - transfer learning to the medical domain is useful. The long-standing assumption that features from the source domain get reused has recently been called into question. Through a series of experiments on several medical image benchmark datasets, we explore the relationship between transfer learning, data size, the capacity and inductive bias of the model, as well as the distance between the source and target domain. Our findings suggest that transfer learning is beneficial in most cases, and we characterize the important role feature reuse plays in its success."}

Several works attempt to detect whether a given DNN has been injected with a specific trigger during the training. In a parallel line of research, the lottery ticket hypothesis reveals the existence of sparse subnetworks which are capable of reaching competitive performance as the dense network after independent training. Connecting these two dots, we investigate the problem of Trojan DNN detection from the brand new lens of sparsity, even when no clean training data is available. Our crucial observation is that the Trojan features are significantly more stable to network pruning than benign features. Leveraging that, we propose a novel Trojan network detection regime: first locating a \"winning Trojan lottery ticket\" which preserves nearly full Trojan information yet only chance-level performance on clean inputs; then recovering the trigger embedded in this already isolated subnetwork. Extensive experiments on various datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, with different network architectures, i.e., VGG-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-20s, and DenseNet-100 demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.

In this paper, we propose a novel audio-visual speech enhancement framework for high-fidelity telecommunications in AR/VR. Our approach leverages audio-visual speech cues to generate the codes of a neural speech codec, enabling efficient synthesis of clean, realistic speech from noisy signals. Given the importance of speaker-specific cues in speech, we focus on developing personalized models that work well for individual speakers.

However, only exploiting single modal information, e.g., point cloud, previous approaches fail to produce faithful descriptions. Though aggregating 2D features into point clouds may be beneficial, it introduces an extra computational burden, especially in inference phases. In this study, we investigate a cross-modal knowledge transfer using Transformer for 3D dense captioning, X-Trans2Cap, to effectively boost the performance of single-modal 3D caption through knowledge distillation using a teacher-student framework. In practice, during the training phase, the teacher network exploits auxiliary 2D modality and guides the student network that only takes point clouds as input through the feature consistency constraints. Owing to the well-designed cross-modal feature fusion module and the feature alignment in the training phase, X-Trans2Cap acquires rich appearance information embedded in 2D images with ease. Thus, a more faithful caption can be generated only using point clouds during the inference. Qualitative and quantitative results confirm that X-Trans2Cap outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin, i.e., about +21 and about +16 absolute CIDEr score on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets, respectively."}

Our method enables pausing the video at any frame and rendering the subject from arbitrary new camera viewpoints or even a full 360-degree camera path for that particular frame and body pose. This task is particularly challenging, as it requires synthesizing photorealistic details of the body, as seen from various camera angles that may not exist in the input video, as well as synthesizing fine details such as cloth folds and facial appearance. Our method optimizes for a volumetric representation of the person in a canonical T-pose, in concert with a motion field that maps the estimated canonical representation to every frame of the video via backward warps. The motion field is decomposed into skeletal rigid and non-rigid motions, produced by deep networks. We show significant performance improvements over prior work, and compelling examples of free-viewpoint renderings from monocular video of moving humans in challenging uncontrolled capture scenarios."}

For example, we can not measure the exact distance of a person to the camera from a single view image without additional scene assumptions (e.g., known height). Existing learning based approaches circumvent this issue by reconstructing the 3D pose up to scale. However, there are many applications such as virtual telepresence, robotics, and augmented reality that require metric scale reconstruction. In this paper, we show that audio signals recorded along with an image, provide complementary information to reconstruct the metric 3D pose of the person. The key insight is that as the audio signals traverse across the 3D space, their interactions with the body provide metric information about the body's pose. Based on this insight, we introduce a time-invariant transfer function called pose kernel---the impulse response of audio signals induced by the body pose. The main properties of the pose kernel are that (1) its envelope highly correlates with 3D pose, (2) the time response corresponds to arrival time, indicating the metric distance to the microphone, and (3) it is invariant to changes in the scene geometry configurations. Therefore, it is readily generalizable to unseen scenes. We design a multi-stage 3D CNN that fuses audio and visual signals and learns to reconstruct 3D pose in a metric scale. We show that our multi-modal method produces accurate metric reconstruction in real world scenes, which is not possible with state-of-the-art lifting approaches including parametric mesh regression and depth regression."}

Regardless of the network architecture or the methodology used for improved feature learning, these models share one thing, which is the use of max-pooling in the end to obtain permutation invariant features. We first show that this traditional approach causes only a fraction of 3D points contribute to the permutation invariant features, and discards the rest of the points. In order to address this issue and improve the performance of any baseline 3D point classification or segmentation model, we propose a new module, referred to as the Recycling MaxPooling (RMP) module, to recycle and utilize the features of some of the discarded points. We incorporate a refinement loss that uses the recycled features to refine the prediction loss obtained from the features kept by traditional max-pooling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores recycling of still useful points that are traditionally discarded by max-pooling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RMP module by incorporating it into several milestone baselines and state-of-the-art networks for point cloud classification and indoor semantic segmentation tasks. We show that RPM, without any bells and whistles, consistently improves the performance of all the tested networks by using the same base network implementation and hyper-parameters.

However, existing approaches ignored the distribution difference between training and testing data, thereby inducing a large quantization error in inference. To address this issue, we propose a new quantization scheme, Alignment Quantization with ADMM-based Correlation Preservation (AlignQ), which exploits the cumulative distribution function (CDF) to align the data to be i.i.d. (independently and identically distributed) for quantization error minimization. Afterward, our theoretical analysis indicates that the significant changes in data correlations after the quantization induce a large quantization error. Accordingly, we aim to preserve the relationship of data from the original space to the aligned quantization space for retaining the prediction information. We design an optimization process by leveraging the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) optimization to minimize the differences in data correlations before and after the alignment and quantization. In experiments, we visualize non-i.i.d. in training and testing data in the benchmark. We further adopt domain shift data to compare AlignQ with the state-of-the-art. Experimental results show that AlignQ achieves significant performance improvements, especially in low-bit models. Code is available at https://github.com/tinganchen/AlignQ.git."}

In this paper, we propose to learn light field saliency from pixel-level noisy labels obtained from unsupervised hand crafted featured-based saliency methods. Given this goal, a natural question is: can we efficiently incorporate the relationships among light field cues while identifying clean labels in a unified framework? We address this question by formulating the learning as a joint optimization of intra light field features fusion stream and inter scenes correlation stream to generate the predictions. Specially, we first introduce a pixel forgetting guided fusion module to mutually enhance the light field features and exploit pixel consistency across iterations to identify noisy pixels. Next, we introduce a cross scene noise penalty loss for better reflecting latent structures of training data and enabling the learning to be invariant to noise. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework showing that it learns saliency prediction comparable to state-of-the-art fully supervised light field saliency methods.

Bridging the gap between natural human perception and video understanding, it has various potential applications, including interpretable and semantically valid video parsing. Still at an early development stage, existing GEBD solvers are simple extensions of relevant video understanding tasks, disregarding GEBD's distinctive characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for unsupervised/supervised GEBD, by using the Temporal Self-similarity Matrix (TSM) as the video representation. The new Recursive TSM Parsing (RTP) algorithm exploits local diagonal patterns in TSM to detect boundaries, and it is combined with the Boundary Contrastive (BoCo) loss to train our encoder to generate more informative TSMs. Our framework can be applied to both unsupervised and supervised settings, with both achieving state-of-the-art performance by a huge margin in GEBD benchmark.

By leveraging the joint language-image embedding space of the recent Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model, we propose a unified framework that allows manipulating NeRF in a user-friendly way, using either a short text prompt or an exemplar image. Specifically, to combine the novel view synthesis capability of NeRF and the controllable manipulation ability of latent representations from generative models, we introduce a disentangled conditional NeRF architecture that allows individual control over both shape and appearance. This is achieved by performing the shape conditioning via applying a learned deformation field to the positional encoding and deferring color conditioning to the volumetric rendering stage. To bridge this disentangled latent representation to the CLIP embedding, we design two code mappers that take a CLIP embedding as input and update the latent codes to reflect the targeted editing. The mappers are trained with a CLIP-based matching loss to ensure the manipulation accuracy. Furthermore, we propose an inverse optimization method that accurately projects an input image to the latent codes for manipulation to enable editing on real images. We evaluate our approach by extensive experiments on a variety of text prompts and exemplar images and also provide an intuitive editing interface for real-time user interaction."}

Most proposed methods either use rotation invariant descriptors as inputs or try to design rotation equivariant networks. However, robust models generated by these methods have limited performance under clean aligned datasets due to modifications on the original classifiers or input space. In this study, for the first time, we show that the rotation robustness of point cloud classifiers can also be acquired via adversarial training with better performance on both rotated and clean datasets. Specifically, our proposed framework named ART-Point regards the rotation of the point cloud as an attack and improves rotation robustness by training the classifier on inputs with Adversarial RoTations. We contribute an axis-wise rotation attack that uses back-propagated gradients of the pre-trained model to effectively find the adversarial rotations. To avoid model over-fitting on adversarial inputs, we construct rotation pools that leverage the transferability of adversarial rotations among samples to increase the diversity of training data. Moreover, we propose a fast one-step optimization to efficiently reach the final robust model. Experiments show that our proposed rotation attack achieves a high success rate and ART-Point can be used on most existing classifiers to improve the rotation robustness while showing better performance on clean datasets than state-of-the-art methods."}

While NeRF-based techniques excel at representing fine geometric structures with smoothly varying view-dependent appearance, they often fail to accurately capture and reproduce the appearance of glossy surfaces. We address this limitation by introducing Ref-NeRF, which replaces NeRF's parameterization of view-dependent outgoing radiance with a representation of reflected radiance and structures this function using a collection of spatially-varying scene properties. We show that together with a regularizer on normal vectors, our model significantly improves the realism and accuracy of specular reflections. Furthermore, we show that our model's internal representation of outgoing radiance is interpretable and useful for scene editing."}

However, DNNs have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to well-crafted adversarial examples, which may trigger severe safety problems in the real-world applications based on 360-degree images. In this paper, we propose an adversarial attack targeting spherical images, called 360-attactk, that transfers adversarial perturbations from perspective-view (PV) images to a final adversarial spherical image. Given a target spherical image, we first represent it with a set of planar PV images, and then perform 2D attacks on them to obtain adversarial PV images. Considering the issue of the projective distortion between spherical and PV images, we propose a distortion-aware attack to reduce the negative impact of distortion on attack. Moreover, to reconstruct the final adversarial spherical image with high aggressiveness, we calculate the spherical saliency map with a novel spherical spectrum method and next propose a saliency-aware fusion strategy that merges multiple inverse perspective projections for the same position on the spherical image. Extensive experimental results show that 360-attack is effective for disturbing spherical images in the black-box setting. Our attack also proves the presence of adversarial transferability from Z2 to SO3 groups."}

Besides, difficulties in collecting and labeling foggy images hinder the progress of this field. Considering the success in semantic scene understanding under clear weather, we think it is reasonable to transfer knowledge learned from clear images to the foggy domain. As such, the problem becomes to bridge the domain gap between clear images and foggy images. Unlike previous methods that mainly focus on closing the domain gap caused by fog --- defogging the foggy images or fogging the clear images, we propose to alleviate the domain gap by considering fog influence and style variation simultaneously. The motivation is based on our finding that the style-related gap and the fog-related gap can be divided and closed respectively, by adding an intermediate domain. Thus, we propose a new pipeline to cumulatively adapt style, fog and the dual-factor (style and fog). Specifically, we devise a unified framework to disentangle the style factor and the fog factor separately, and then the dual-factor from images in different domains. Furthermore, we collaborate the disentanglement of three factors with a novel cumulative loss to thoroughly disentangle these three factors. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks and shows generalization ability in rainy and snowy scenes."}

While event cameras are proposed to provide measurements of scenes with fast motions or drastic illumination changes, many existing event-based recognition algorithms suffer from performance deterioration under extreme conditions due to significant domain shifts. Ev-TTA mitigates the severe domain gaps by fine-tuning the pre-trained classifiers during the test phase using loss functions inspired by the spatio-temporal characteristics of events. Since the event data is a temporal stream of measurements, our loss function enforces similar predictions for adjacent events to quickly adapt to the changed environment online. Also, we utilize the spatial correlations between two polarities of events to handle noise under extreme illumination, where different polarities of events exhibit distinctive noise distributions. Ev-TTA demonstrates a large amount of performance gain on a wide range of event-based object recognition tasks without extensive additional training. Our formulation can be successfully applied regardless of input representations and further extended into regression tasks. We expect Ev-TTA to provide the key technique to deploy event-based vision algorithms in challenging real-world applications where significant domain shift is inevitable."}

In this paper, we propose and explore a new multi-modal extension of test-time adaptation for 3D semantic segmentation. We find that, directly applying existing methods usually results in performance instability at test time, because multi-modal input is not considered jointly. To design a framework that can take full advantage of multi-modality, where each modality provides regularized self-supervisory signals to other modalities, we propose two complementary modules within and across the modalities. First, Intra-modal Pseudo-label Generation (Intra-PG) is introduced to obtain reliable pseudo labels within each modality by aggregating information from two models that are both pre-trained on source data but updated with target data at different paces. Second, Intermodal Pseudo-label Refinement (Inter-PR) adaptively selects more reliable pseudo labels from different modalities based on a proposed consistency scheme. Experiments demonstrate that our regularized pseudo labels produce stable self-learning signals in numerous multi-modal test-time adaptation scenarios for 3D semantic segmentation.

To improve real world applicability of such models, there are growing interests to develop models optimized for arbitrary upscaling factors. Our proposed method is the first to treat arbitrary rescaling, both upscaling and downscaling, as one unified process. Using joint optimization of both directions, the proposed model is able to learn upscaling and downscaling simultaneously and achieve bidirectional arbitrary image rescaling. It improves the performance of current arbitrary upscaling models by a large margin while at the same time learns to maintain visual perception quality in downscaled images. The proposed model is further shown to be robust in cycle idempotence test, free of severe degradations in reconstruction accuracy when the downscaling-to-upscaling cycle is applied repetitively. This robustness is beneficial for image rescaling in the wild when this cycle could be applied to one image for multiple times. It also performs well on tests with arbitrary large scales and asymmetric scales, even when the model is not trained with such tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our model."}

For similarity map refinement, we propose an adaptive temporal transformer, which first effectively encodes temporal knowledge in a memory-efficient way, before the temporal knowledge is decoded for accurate adjustment of the similarity map. TCTrack is effective and efficient: evaluation on four aerial tracking benchmarks shows its impressive performance; real-world UAV tests show its high speed of over 27 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier."}

Our model belongs to the image-to-image translation framework which consists of an image encoder and decoder, and is trained on pairs of before-and-after edited images to produce multimodal outputs. We show that by inverting image pairs into latent codes of the learned editing space, our model can be leveraged for various downstream editing tasks such as language-guided image editing, personalized editing, editing-style clustering, retrieval, etc. We extensively study the unique properties of the editing space in experiments and demonstrate superior performance on the aforementioned tasks."}

The straightforward design results in a concise framework that requires neither additional rectification module nor character-level annotation for the arbitrarily-shaped text.

However, this procedure discards the structure of geometries and loses the high resolution of VG. Recently, another category of algorithms is proposed to recognize directly from the original VG format. But it is affected by the topological errors that can be filtered out by RG rendering. Instead of looking at one format, it is a good solution to utilize the formats of VG and RG together to avoid these shortcomings. Besides, we argue that the VG-to-RG rendering process is essential to effectively combine VG and RG information. By specifying the rules on how to transfer VG primitives to RG pixels, the rendering process depicts the interaction and correlation between VG and RG. As a result, we propose RenderNet, a unified architecture for recognition on both 2D and 3D scenarios, which considers both VG/RG representations and exploits their interaction by incorporating the VG-to-RG rasterization process.

An ideal AI-aided design tool should automate repetitive routines, and meanwhile accept human guidance and provide smart/proactive suggestions. However, the capability of involving humans into the loop has been largely ignored in existing methods which are mostly end-to-end approaches. To this end, we propose a new human-in-the-loop generative model, iPLAN, which is capable of automatically generating layouts, but also interacting with designers throughout the whole procedure, enabling humans and AI to co-evolve a sketchy idea gradually into the final design. iPLAN is evaluated on diverse datasets and compared with existing methods.

In this work, we propose a novel method to represent general shapes including non-watertight shapes and shapes with multi-layer surfaces. We introduce General Implicit Function for 3D Shape (GIFS), which models the relationships between every two points instead of the relationships between points and surfaces. Instead of dividing 3D space into predefined inside-outside regions, GIFS encodes whether two points are separated by any surface.

To address this problem, We propose Deblur-NeRF, the first method that can recover a sharp NeRF from blurry input. We adopt an analysis-by-synthesis approach that reconstructs blurry views by simulating the blurring process, thus making NeRF robust to blurry inputs. The core of this simulation is a novel Deformable Sparse Kernel (DSK) module that models spatially-varying blur kernels by deforming a canonical sparse kernel at each spatial location. The ray origin of each kernel point is jointly optimized, inspired by the physical blurring process. This module is parameterized as an MLP that has the ability to be generalized to various blur types. Jointly optimizing the NeRF and the DSK module allows us to restore a sharp NeRF. We demonstrate that our method can be used on both camera motion blur and defocus blur: the two most common types of blur in real scenes.

In this paper, we propose the PhysFormer, an end-to-end video transformer based architecture, to adaptively aggregate both local and global spatio-temporal features for rPPG representation enhancement. As key modules in PhysFormer, the temporal difference transformers first enhance the quasi-periodic rPPG features with temporal difference guided global attention, and then refine the local spatio-temporal representation against interference. Furthermore, we also propose the label distribution learning and a curriculum learning inspired dynamic constraint in frequency domain, which provide elaborate supervisions for PhysFormer and alleviate overfitting. Comprehensive experiments are performed on four benchmark datasets to show our superior performance on both intra- and cross-dataset testings. One highlight is that, unlike most transformer networks needed pretraining from large-scale datasets, the proposed PhysFormer can be easily trained from scratch on rPPG datasets, which makes it promising as a novel transformer baseline for the rPPG community. The codes will be released soon."}

Typically, only a few samples can serve as the style/content reference (termed few-shot learning), which further increases the difficulty to preserve local style patterns or detailed glyph structures. We investigate the drawbacks of previous studies and find that a coarse-grained discriminator is insufficient for supervising a font generator. To this end, we propose a novel Component-Aware Module (CAM), which supervises the generator to decouple content and style at a more fine-grained level, i.e., the component level. Different from previous studies struggling to increase the complexity of generators, we aim to perform more effective supervision for a relatively simple generator to achieve its full potential, which is a brand new perspective for font generation. The whole framework achieves remarkable results by coupling component-level supervision with adversarial learning, hence we call it Component-Guided GAN, shortly CG-GAN. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot font generation methods. Furthermore, it can be applied to handwritten word synthesis and scene text image editing, suggesting the generalization of our approach."}

However, NeRF's view dependency can only handle simple reflections like highlights but cannot deal with complex reflections such as those from glass and mirrors. In these scenarios, NeRF models the virtual image as real geometries which leads to inaccurate depth estimation, and produces blurry renderings when the multi-view consistency is violated as the reflected objects may only be seen under some of the viewpoints. To overcome these issues, we introduce NeRFReN, which is built upon NeRF to model scenes with reflections. Specifically, we propose to split a scene into transmitted and reflected components, and model the two components with separate neural radiance fields. Considering that this decomposition is highly under-constrained, we exploit geometric priors and apply carefully-designed training strategies to achieve reasonable decomposition results. Experiments on various self-captured scenes show that our method achieves high-quality novel view synthesis and physically sound depth estimation results while enabling scene editing applications."}

Previous approaches cannot tackle them well due to simplified BRDF and unsuitable illumination representations. In this paper, we present PhyIR, a neural inverse rendering method with a more completed SVBRDF representation and a physics-based in-network rendering layer, which can handle complex material and incorporate physical constraints by re-rendering realistic and detailed specular reflectance. Our framework estimates geometry, material and Spatially-Coherent (SC) illumination from a single indoor panorama. Due to the lack of panoramic datasets with completed SVBRDF and full-spherical light probes, we introduce an artist-designed dataset named FutureHouse with high-quality geometry, SVBRDF and per-pixel Spatially-Varying (SV) lighting. To ensure the coherence of SV lighting, a novel SC loss is proposed. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts quantitatively and qualitatively, and is able to produce photorealistic results for a number of applications such as dynamic virtual object insertion."}

However, existing methods always only use the real image as the positive sample to guide the training, and at most introduce the corresponding composite image as a single negative sample for an auxiliary constraint, which leads to limited distortion knowledge, and further causes a too large solution space, making the generated harmonized image distorted. Besides, none of them jointly constrain from the foreground self-style and foreground-background style consistency, which exacerbates this problem. Moreover, recent region-aware adaptive instance normalization achieves great success but only considers the global background feature distribution, making the aligned foreground feature distribution biased. To address these issues, we propose a self-consistent style contrastive learning scheme (SCS-Co). By dynamically generating multiple negative samples, our SCS-Co can learn more distortion knowledge and well regularize the generated harmonized image in the style representation space from two aspects of the foreground self-style and foreground-background style consistency, leading to a more photorealistic visual result. In addition, we propose a background-attentional adaptive instance normalization (BAIN) to achieve an attention-weighted background feature distribution according to the foreground-background feature similarity. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative comparison and visual analysis."}

Most current work uses a fixed single-scale window for modeling by default, ignoring the impact of window size on model performance. However, this may limit the modeling potential of these window-based models for multi-scale information. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Dynamic Window Vision Transformer (DW-ViT). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use dynamic multi-scale windows to explore the upper limit of the effect of window settings on model performance. In DW-ViT, multi-scale information is obtained by assigning windows of different sizes to different head groups of window multi-head self-attention. Then, the information is dynamically fused by assigning different weights to the multi-scale window branches. We conducted a detailed performance evaluation on three datasets, ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, and COCO. Compared with related state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods, DW-ViT obtains the best performance. Specifically, compared with the current SoTA Swin Transformers [??], DW-ViT has achieved consistent and substantial improvements on all three datasets with similar parameters and computational costs. In addition, DW-ViT exhibits good scalability and can be easily inserted into any window-based visual transformers."}

However, because of the large modality discrepancy between visible and infrared images, the generated images usually have low qualities and introduce much more interfering information (e.g., color inconsistency). This greatly degrades the subsequent VI-ReID performance. Alternatively, we present a novel Feature-level Modality Compensation Network (FMCNet) for VIReID in this paper, which aims to compensate the missing modality-specific information in the feature level rather than in the image level, i.e., directly generating those missing modality-specific features of one modality from existing modality-shared features of the other modality. This will enable our model to mainly generate some discriminative person related modality-specific features and discard those non-discriminative ones for benefiting VI-ReID. For that, a single-modality feature decomposition module is first designed to decompose single-modality features into modality-specific ones and modality-shared ones. Then, a feature-level modality compensation module is present to generate those missing modality-specific features from existing modality-shared ones. Finally, a shared-specific feature fusion module is proposed to combine the existing and generated features for VI-ReID. The effectiveness of our proposed model is verified on two benchmark datasets."}

Given the recent success of deep learning in medical image segmentation, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been introduced to find high-performance 3D segmentation network architectures. However, because of the massive computational requirements of 3D data and the discrete optimization nature of architecture search, previous NAS methods require a long search time or necessary continuous relaxation, and commonly lead to sub-optimal network architectures. While one-shot NAS can potentially address these disadvantages, its application in the segmentation domain has not been well studied in the expansive multi-scale multi-path search space. To enable one-shot NAS for medical image segmentation, our method, named HyperSegNAS, introduces a HyperNet to assist super-net training by incorporating architecture topology information. Such a HyperNet can be removed once the super-net is trained and introduces no overhead during architecture search. We show that HyperSegNAS yields better performing and more intuitive architectures compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation networks; furthermore, it can quickly and accurately find good architecture candidates under different computing constraints. Our method is evaluated on public datasets from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, and achieves SOTA performances."}

This has made it hard to generalize these methods to in-the-wild shapes, e.g., from internet model collections or depth sensors. ConDor is a self-supervised method that learns to Canonicalize the 3D orientation and position for full and partial 3D point clouds. We build on top of Tensor Field Networks (TFNs), a class of permutation- and rotation-equivariant, and translation-invariant 3D networks. During inference, our method takes an unseen full or partial 3D point cloud at an arbitrary pose and outputs an equivariant canonical pose. During training, this network uses self-supervision losses to learn the canonical pose from an un-canonicalized collection of full and partial 3D point clouds. ConDor can also learn to consistently co-segment object parts without any supervision. Extensive quantitative results on four new metrics show that our approach outperforms existing methods while enabling new applications such as operation on depth images and annotation transfer."}

However, in real-world scenarios (e.g., MRI medical diagnosis, X-ray security inspection), there still exists another type of shift, named endogenous shift, where the differences between domains are mainly caused by the intrinsic factors (e.g., imaging mechanisms, hardware components, etc.), and usually inconspicuous. This shift can also severely harm the cross-domain detection performance but has been rarely studied. To support this study, we contribute the first Endogenous Domain Shift (EDS) benchmark, X-ray security inspection, where the endogenous shifts among the domains are mainly caused by different X-ray machine types with different hardware parameters, wear degrees, etc. EDS consists of 14,219 images including 31,654 common instances from three domains (X-ray machines), with bounding-box annotations from 10 categories. To handle the endogenous shift, we further introduce the Perturbation Suppression Network (PSN), motivated by the fact that this shift is mainly caused by two types of perturbations: category-dependent and category-independent ones. PSN respectively exploits local prototype alignment and global adversarial learning mechanism to suppress these two types of perturbations. The comprehensive evaluation results show that PSN outperforms SOTA methods, serving a new perspective to the cross-domain research community."}

Various 3D-CNN based methods have been presented to tackle both the spatial and temporal dimensions in thetask of video action recognition with competitive results.However, these methods have suffered some fundamentallimitations such as lack of robustness and generalization,e.g., how does the temporal ordering of video frames af-fect the recognition results? This work presents a novelend-to-end Transformer-based Directed Attention (Direc-Former) framework1for robust action recognition. The method takes a simple but novel perspective of Transformer-based approach to understand the right order of sequence actions. Therefore, the contributions of this work are three-fold. Firstly, we introduce the problem of ordered temporal learning issues to the action recognition problem. Secondly, a new Directed Attention mechanism is introduced to understand and provide attentions to human actions in the right order. Thirdly, we introduce the conditional dependency in action sequence modeling that includes orders and classes. The proposed approach consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results compared with the recent action recognition methods [4, 15, 62, 64], on three standard large-scale benchmarks, i.e. Jester, Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-V2."}

In addition, the generated dance sequence also needs to maintain temporal coherency with different music genres. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel music-to-dance framework, Bailando, with two powerful components: 1) a choreographic memory that learns to summarize meaningful dancing units from 3D pose sequence to a quantized codebook, 2) an actor-critic Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that composes these units to a fluent dance coherent to the music. With the learned choreographic memory, dance generation is realized on the quantized units that meet high choreography standards, such that the generated dancing sequences are confined within the spatial constraints. To achieve synchronized alignment between diverse motion tempos and music beats, we introduce an actor-critic-based reinforcement learning scheme to the GPT with a newly-designed beat-align reward function. Extensive experiments on the standard benchmark demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Notably, the learned choreographic memory is shown to discover human-interpretable dancing-style poses in an unsupervised manner."}

With growing use cases of model reuse and distillation, there is a need to also study transfer of interpretability from one model to another. We present Proto2Proto, a novel method to transfer interpretability of one prototypical part network to another via knowledge distillation. Our approach aims to add interpretability to the \"dark\" knowledge transferred from the teacher to the shallower student model. We propose two novel losses: \"Global Explanation\" loss and \"Patch-Prototype Correspondence\" loss to facilitate such a transfer. Global Explanation loss forces the student prototypes to be close to teacher prototypes, and Patch-Prototype Correspondence loss enforces the local representations of the student to be similar to that of the teacher. Further, we propose three novel metrics to evaluate the student's proximity to the teacher as measures of interpretability transfer in our settings. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets. Our experiments show that the proposed method indeed achieves interpretability transfer from teacher to student while simultaneously exhibiting competitive performance.

However, the static and dynamic convolutions are either layout-agnostic or computation-heavy, making it inappropriate for layout-specific applications, e.g., face recognition and medical image segmentation. We observe that these applications naturally exhibit the characteristics of large intra-image (spatial) variance and small cross-image variance. This observation motivates our efficient translation variant convolution (TVConv) for layout-aware visual processing. Technically, TVConv is composed of affinity maps and a weight-generating block. While affinity maps depict pixel-paired relationships gracefully, the weight-generating block can be explicitly overparameterized for better training while maintaining efficient inference. Although conceptually simple, TVConv significantly improves the efficiency of the convolution and can be readily plugged into various network architectures. Extensive experiments on face recognition show that TVConv reduces the computational cost by up to 3.1x and improves the corresponding throughput by 2.3x while maintaining a high accuracy compared to the depthwise convolution. Moreover, for the same computation cost, we boost the mean accuracy by up to 4.21%. We also conduct experiments on the optic disc/cup segmentation task and obtain better generalization performance, which helps mitigate the critical data scarcity issue.

In this work, we study a new open set problem; the few-shot 6D object poses estimation: estimating the 6D pose of an unknown object by a few support views without extra training. To tackle the problem, we point out the importance of fully exploring the appearance and geometric relationship between the given support views and query scene patches and propose a dense prototypes matching framework by extracting and matching dense RGBD prototypes with transformers. Moreover, we show that the priors from diverse appearances and shapes are crucial to the generalization capability under the problem setting and thus propose a large-scale RGBD photorealistic dataset (ShapeNet6D) for network pre-training. A simple and effective online texture blending approach is also introduced to eliminate the domain gap from the synthesis dataset, which enriches appearance diversity at a low cost. Finally, we discuss possible solutions to this problem and establish benchmarks on popular datasets to facilitate future research."}

First, we develop a virtual teleoperation data-collection infrastructure - connecting Habitat simulator running in a web browser to Amazon Mechanical Turk, allowing remote users to teleoperate virtual robots, safely and at scale. We collect 80k demonstrations for ObjectNav and 12k demonstrations for Pick&Place, which is an order of magnitude larger than existing human demonstration datasets in simulation or on real robots. Our virtual teleoperation data contains 29.3M actions, and is equivalent to 22.6k hours of real-world teleoperation time, and illustrates rich, diverse strategies for solving the tasks. Second, we use this data to answer the question - how does large-scale imitation learning (IL) (which has not been hitherto possible) compare to reinforcement learning (RL) (which is the status quo)? On ObjectNav, we find that IL (with no bells or whistles) using 70k human demonstrations outperforms RL using 240k agent-gathered trajectories. This effectively establishes an 'exchange rate' - a single human demonstration appears to be worth  4 agent-gathered ones. More importantly, we find the IL-trained agent learns efficient object-search behavior from humans - it peeks into rooms, checks corners for small objects, turns in place to get a panoramic view - none of these are exhibited as prominently by the RL agent, and to induce these behaviors via contemporary RL techniques would require tedious reward engineering. Finally, accuracy vs. training data size plots show promising scaling behavior, suggesting that simply collecting more demonstrations is likely to advance the state of art further. On Pick&Place, the comparison is starker - IL agents achieve  18% success on episodes with new object-receptacle locations when trained with 9.5k human demonstrations, while RL agents fail to get beyond 0%. Overall, our work provides compelling evidence for investing in large-scale imitation learning. Project page: https://ram81.github.io/projects/habitat-web."}

This strategy can adaptively generate one-hot \"hard\" labels converted from task model predictions for better task model training. (2) For the unselected unlabeled images with low confidence, we introduce an Active learning (AL) algorithm to find the informative samples as the annotation candidates by exploiting virtual adversarial perturbation and model's density-aware entropy. These informative candidates are subsequently fed into the next training cycle for better SSL label propagation. Notably, the adaptive pseudo-labeling and informative active annotation form a learning closed-loop that are mutually collaborative to boost medical image SSL. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we collected a metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) dataset that aims to optimize MESCC diagnosis and classification for improved specialist referral and treatment. We conducted an extensive experimental study of BoostMIS on MESCC and another public dataset COVIDx.

For the sake of trade-off between efficiency and performance, a group of works merely perform SA operation within local patches, whereas the global contextual information is abandoned, which would be indispensable for visual recognition tasks. To solve the issue, the subsequent global-local ViTs take a stab at marrying local SA with global one in parallel or alternative way in the model. Nevertheless, the exhaustively combined local and global context may exist redundancy for various visual data, and the receptive field within each layer is fixed. Alternatively, a more graceful way is that global and local context can adaptively contribute per se to accommodate different visual data. To achieve this goal, we in this paper propose a novel ViT architecture, termed NomMer, which can dynamically Nominate the synergistic global-local context in vision transforMer. By investigating the working pattern of our proposed NomMer, we further explore what context information is focused. Beneficial from this \"dynamic nomination\" mechanism, without bells and whistles, the NomMer can not only achieve 84.5% Top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet with only 73M parameters, but also show promising performance on dense prediction tasks, i.e., object detection and semantic segmentation.

Despite the prevalence, current Rep methods simply re-parameterize all operations into an augmented network, including those that rarely contribute to the model's performance. As such, the price to pay is an expensive computational overhead to manipulate these unnecessary behaviors. To eliminate the above caveats, we aim to bootstrap the training with minimal cost by devising a dynamic re-parameterization (DyRep) method, which encodes Rep technique into the training process that dynamically evolves the network structures. Concretely, our proposal adaptively finds the operations which contribute most to the loss in the network, and applies Rep to enhance their representational capacity. Besides, to suppress the noisy and redundant operations introduced by Rep, we devise a de-parameterization technique for a more compact re-parameterization. With this regard, DyRep is more efficient than Rep since it smoothly evolves the given network instead of constructing an over-parameterized network. Experimental results demonstrate our effectiveness, e.g., DyRep improves the accuracy of ResNet-18 by 2.04% on ImageNet and reduces 22% runtime over the baseline."}

To reduce the labels dependency, various active learning strategies have been proposed, typically based on the confidence of the detector.

In this work, we propose a unified framework for active learning, that considers both the uncertainty and the robustness of the detector, ensuring that the network performs well in all classes. Furthermore, our method leverages auto-labeling to suppress a potential distribution drift while boosting the performance of the model. Experiments on PASCAL VOC07+12 and MS-COCO show that our method consistently outperforms a wide range of active learning methods, yielding up to a 7.7% improvement in mAP, or up to 82% reduction in labeling cost.

Using supervised data of real-world 9D poses is tedious and erroneous, and also fails to generalize to unseen scenarios. Besides, category-level pose estimation requires a method to be able to generalize to unseen objects at test time, which is also challenging. Drawing inspirations from traditional point pair features (PPFs), in this paper, we design a novel Category-level PPF (CPPF) voting method to achieve accurate, robust and generalizable 9D pose estimation in the wild. To obtain robust pose estimation, we sample numerous point pairs on an object, and for each pair our model predicts necessary SE(3)-invariant voting statistics on object centers, orientations and scales. A novel coarse-to-fine voting algorithm is proposed to eliminate noisy point pair samples and generate final predictions from the population. To get rid of false positives in the orientation voting process, an auxiliary binary disambiguating classification task is introduced for each sampled point pair. In order to detect objects in the wild, we carefully design our sim-to-real pipeline by training on synthetic point clouds only, unless objects have ambiguous poses in geometry. Under this circumstance, color information is leveraged to disambiguate these poses.

The inherent complexity of videos makes this task challenging but also provides ground for leveraging multi-modal inputs (e.g., RGB, Flow, Audio). Most previous works utilize the multi-modal information by either aligning each modality individually or learning representation via cross-modal self-supervision. Different from previous works, we find that the cross-domain alignment can be more effectively done by using cross-modal interaction first. Cross-modal knowledge interaction allows other modalities to supplement missing transferable information because of the cross-modal complementarity. Also, the most transferable aspects of data can be highlighted using cross-modal consensus. In this work, we present a novel model that jointly considers these two characteristics for domain adaptive action recognition. We achieve this by implementing two modules, where the first module exchanges complementary transferable information across modalities through the semantic space, and the second module finds the most transferable spatial region based on the consensus of all modalities. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets, including the complex fine-grained dataset EPIC-Kitchens-100."}

In this work, we show the advantages of prototype representations for understanding and revising the latent space of neural concept learners. For this purpose, we introduce interactive Concept Swapping Networks (iCSNs), a novel framework for learning concept-grounded representations via weak supervision and implicit prototype representations. iCSNs learn to bind conceptual information to specific prototype slots by swapping the latent representations of paired images. This semantically grounded and discrete latent space facilitates human understanding and human-machine interaction. We support this claim by conducting experiments on our novel data set \"Elementary Concept Reasoning\" (ECR), focusing on visual concepts shared by geometric objects."}

This task involves labeling each pixel of the human image according to the classes. Since the human body comprises hierarchically structured parts, each body part of an image can have its sole position distribution characteristic. Probably, a human head is less likely to be under the feet, and arms are more likely to be near the torso. Inspired by this observation, we make instance class distributions by accumulating the original human parsing label in the horizontal and vertical directions, which can be utilized as supervision signals. Using these horizontal and vertical class distribution labels, the network is guided to exploit the intrinsic position distribution of each class. We combine two guided features to form a spatial guidance map, which is then superimposed onto the baseline network by multiplication and concatenation to distinguish the human parts precisely. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method on three well-known benchmarks: LIP, ATR, and CIHP databases."}

This task, which is often applied to novel view synthesis, is recently revolutionized by Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for its state-of-the-art quality and flexibility. However, NeRF and its variants require a lengthy training time ranging from hours to days for a single scene. In contrast, our approach achieves NeRF-comparable quality and converges rapidly from scratch in less than 15 minutes with a single GPU. We adopt a representation consisting of a density voxel grid for scene geometry and a feature voxel grid with a shallow network for complex view-dependent appearance. Modeling with explicit and discretized volume representations is not new, but we propose two simple yet non-trivial techniques that contribute to fast convergence speed and high-quality output. First, we introduce the post-activation interpolation on voxel density, which is capable of producing sharp surfaces in lower grid resolution. Second, direct voxel density optimization is prone to suboptimal geometry solutions, so we robustify the optimization process by imposing several priors. Finally, evaluation on five inward-facing benchmarks shows that our method matches, if not surpasses, NeRF's quality, yet it only takes about 15 minutes to train from scratch for a new scene. We will make our code publicly available."}

However, the commonly used hand-crafted priors and optimization-driven solutions lead to the absence of adaptivity and efficiency. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Retinex-based deep unfolding network (URetinex-Net), which unfolds an optimization problem into a learnable network to decompose a low-light image into reflectance and illumination layers. By formulating the decomposition problem as an implicit priors regularized model, three learning-based modules are carefully designed, responsible for data-dependent initialization, high-efficient unfolding optimization, and user-specified illumination enhancement, respectively. Particularly, the proposed unfolding optimization module, introducing two networks to adaptively fit implicit priors in data-driven manner, can realize noise suppression and details preservation for the final decomposition results. Extensive experiments on real-world low-light images qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods."}

Although traditional and deep learning-based algorithmic pipelines exist for this purpose, they have two major drawbacks: lengthy runtimes of multiple hours (traditional) or intricate post-processing, such as mesh extraction and topology correction (deep learning-based). In this work, we address both of these issues and propose Vox2Cortex, a deep learning-based algorithm that directly yields topologically correct, three-dimensional meshes of the boundaries of the cortex. Vox2Cortex leverages convolutional and graph convolutional neural networks to deform an initial template to the densely folded geometry of the cortex represented by an input MRI scan. We show in extensive experiments on three brain MRI datasets that our meshes are as accurate as the ones reconstructed by state-of-the-art methods in the field, without the need for time- and resource-intensive post-processing. To accurately reconstruct the tightly folded cortex, we work with meshes containing about 168,000 vertices at test time, scaling deep explicit reconstruction methods to a new level."}

However, we observe that learning from data with more views is not guaranteed to achieve better clustering performance than from data with fewer views. To address this issue, we propose a general deep learning based framework that is guaranteed to reduce the risk of performance degradation caused by view increase. Concretely, the model is trained to simultaneously extract complementary information and discard the meaningless noise by automatically selecting features. These two learning procedures are incorporated into one unified framework by the proposed optimization objective. In theory, the empirical clustering risk of the model is no higher than learning from data before the view increase and data of the new increased single view. Also, the expected clustering risk of the model under divergence-based loss is no higher than that with high probability. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework in achieving safe multi-view clustering."}

Although recent works have shown the success of capsule networks on simple objects like digits, the human faces with homologous structures, which are suitable for capsules to describe, have not been explored. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Parsing Capsule Network (HP-Capsule) for unsupervised face subpart-part discovery. When browsing large-scale face images without labels, the network first encodes the frequently observed patterns with a set of explainable subpart capsules. Then, the subpart capsules are assembled into part-level capsules through a Transformer-based Parsing Module (TPM) to learn the compositional relations between them. During training, as the face hierarchy is progressively built and refined, the part capsules adaptively encode the face parts with semantic consistency. HP-Capsule extends the application of capsule networks from digits to human faces and takes a step forward to show how the neural networks understand homologous objects without human intervention. Besides, HP-Capsule gives unsupervised face segmentation results by the covered regions of part capsules, enabling qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Experiments on BP4D and Multi-PIE datasets show the effectiveness of our method."}

In the 3D-QA task, models receive visual information from the entire 3D scene of the rich RGB-D indoor scan and answer the given textual questions about the 3D scene. Unlike the 2D-question answering of VQA, the conventional 2D-QA models suffer from problems with spatial understanding of object alignment and directions and fail the object identification from the textual questions in 3D-QA. We propose a baseline model for 3D-QA, named ScanQA model, where the model learns a fused descriptor from 3D object proposals and encoded sentence embeddings. This learned descriptor correlates the language expressions with the underlying geometric features of the 3D scan and facilitates the regression of 3D bounding boxes to determine described objects in textual questions. We collected human-edited question-answer pairs with free-form answers that are grounded to 3D objects in each 3D scene. Our new ScanQA dataset contains over 40K question-answer pairs from the 800 indoor scenes drawn from the ScanNet dataset. To the best of our knowledge, ScanQA is the first large-scale effort to perform object-grounded question-answering in 3D environments."}

One limitation of existing solutions is that they capture relevant knowledge from text-only knowledge bases, which merely contain facts expressed by first-order predicates or language descriptions while lacking complex but indispensable multimodal knowledge for visual understanding. How to construct vision-relevant and explainable multimodal knowledge for the VQA scenario has been less studied. In this paper, we propose MuKEA to represent multimodal knowledge by an explicit triplet to correlate visual objects and fact answers with implicit relations. To bridge the heterogeneous gap, we propose three objective losses to learn the triplet representations from complementary views: embedding structure, topological relation and semantic space. By adopting a pre-training and fine-tuning learning strategy, both basic and domain-specific multimodal knowledge are progressively accumulated for answer prediction. We outperform the state-of-the-art by 3.35% and 6.08% respectively on two challenging knowledge-required datasets: OK-VQA and KRVQA. Experimental results prove the complementary benefits of the multimodal knowledge with existing knowledge bases and the advantages of our end-to-end framework over the existing pipeline methods.

This flexible representation enables correspondence prediction and provides rich features for the matching stage. Finally, we propose a novel optimal transport solver by recurrently updating features on non-confident nodes to learn globally consistent correspondences between the shapes. Our results on publicly available datasets suggest robust performance in presence of severe deformations without the need of extensive training or refinement."}

Most previous works address the problem by first fusing the image and question in the multi-modal space, which is inflexible for further fusion with a vast amount of external knowledge. In this paper, we call for an alternative paradigm for the OK-VQA task, which transforms the image into plain text, so that we can enable knowledge passage retrieval, and generative question-answering in the natural language space. This paradigm takes advantage of the sheer volume of gigantic knowledge bases and the richness of pre-trained language models. A Transform-Retrieve-Generate framework (TRiG) framework is proposed, which can be plug-and-played with alternative image-to-text models and textual knowledge bases. Experimental results show that our TRiG framework outperforms all state-of-the-art supervised methods by at least 11.1% absolute margin."}

One of the biggest challenges of VEA is to bridge the affective gap between visual clues in a picture and the emotion expressed by the picture. As the granularity of emotions increases, the affective gap increases as well. Existing deep approaches try to bridge the gap by directly learning discrimination among emotions globally in one shot without considering the hierarchical relationship among emotions at different affective levels and the affective level of emotions to be classified. In this paper, we present the Multi-level Dependent Attention Network (MDAN) with two branches, to leverage the emotion hierarchy and the correlation between different affective levels and semantic levels. The bottom-up branch directly learns emotions at the highest affective level and strictly follows the emotion hierarchy while predicting emotions at lower affective levels. In contrast, the top-down branch attempt to disentangle the affective gap by one-to-one mapping between semantic levels and affective levels, namely, Affective Semantic Mapping. At each semantic level, a local classifier learns discrimination among emotions at the corresponding affective level. Finally, We integrate global learning and local learning into a unified deep framework and optimize the network simultaneously. Moreover, to properly extract and leverage channel dependencies and spatial attention while disentangling the affective gap, we carefully designed two attention modules: the Multi-head Cross Channel Attention module and the Level-dependent Class Activation Map module. Finally, the proposed deep framework obtains new state-of-the-art performance on six VEA benchmarks, where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, e.g., +3.85% on the WEBEmo dataset at 25 classes classification accuracy."}

We introduce a deep neural network with two branches to reverse each type of degradation, which is more effective than performing both restorations in a single forward network. We also propose an affine transform connection to replace the skip connection used in most existing DNNs for restoring UDC images. Confining the solution space to the linear transform domain reduces the blurring caused by convolution; and any gross color shift in the training images is eliminated by inverse color filtering. Trained on three datasets of UDC images, our network outperformed existing methods in terms of measures of distortion and of perceived image quality."}

Recently, in light of the excellent performances of self-attention mechanism in the language field, transformers tailored for visual data have drawn numerous attention and triumphed CNNs in various vision tasks. These vision transformers heavily rely on large-scale pre-training to achieve competitive accuracy, which not only hinders the freedom of architectural design in downstream tasks like object detection, but also causes learning bias and domain mismatch in the fine-tuning stages. To this end, we aim to get rid of the \"pre-train & fine-tune\" paradigm of vision transformer and train transformer based object detector from scratch. Some earlier work in the CNNs era have successfully trained CNNs based detectors without pre-training, unfortunately, their findings do not generalize well when the backbone is switched from CNNs to vision transformer. Instead of proposing a specific vision transformer based detector, in this work, our goal is to reveal the insights of training vision transformer based detectors from scratch. In particular, we expect those insights can help other researchers and practitioners, and inspire more interesting research in other fields, such as semantic segmentation, visual-linguistic pre-training, etc. One of the key findings is that both architectural changes and more epochs play critical roles in training vision transformer based detectors from scratch. Experiments on MS COCO datasets demonstrate that vision transformer based detectors trained from scratch can also achieve similar performances to their counterparts with ImageNet pre-training."}

State-of-the-art methods mostly rely on a dense anchoring scheme, where anchors are sampled uniformly over the temporal domain with a discretized grid, and then regress the accurate boundaries. In this paper, we revisit this foundational stage and introduce Recurrent Continuous Localization (RCL), which learns a fully continuous anchoring representation. Specifically, the proposed representation builds upon an explicit model conditioned with video embeddings and temporal coordinates, which ensure the capability of detecting segments with arbitrary length. To optimize the continuous representation, we develop an effective scale-invariant sampling strategy and recurrently refine the prediction in subsequent iterations. Our continuous anchoring scheme is fully differentiable, allowing to be seamlessly integrated into existing detectors, e.g., BMN and G-TAD. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that our continuous representation steadily surpasses other discretized counterparts by  2% mAP. As a result, RCL achieves 52.9% mAP@0.5 on THUMOS14 and 37.65% mAP on ActivtiyNet v1.3, outperforming all existing single-model detectors."}

However, such CSLR backbones are hard to be trained sufficiently with a single connectionist temporal classification loss. In this work, we propose two auxiliary constraints to enhance the CSLR backbones from the perspective of consistency. The first constraint aims to enhance the visual module, which easily suffers from the insufficient training problem. Specifically, since sign languages convey information mainly with signers' faces and hands, we insert a keypoint-guided spatial attention module into the visual module to enforce it to focus on informative regions, i.e., spatial attention consistency. Nevertheless, only enhancing the visual module may not fully exploit the power of the backbone. Motivated by that both the output features of the visual and sequential modules represent the same sentence, we further impose a sentence embedding consistency constraint between them to enhance the representation power of both the features. Experimental results over three representative backbones validate the effectiveness of the two constraints. More remarkably, with a transformer-based backbone, our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on three benchmarks, PHOENIX-2014, PHOENIX-2014-T, and CSL."}

Prior methods deem the fog as noise and discard it before matching. Different from them, we propose to explore depth hints from fog and improve stereo matching via these hints. The exploration of depth hints is designed from the perspective of rendering. The rendering is conducted by reversing the atmospheric scattering process and removing the fog within a selected depth range. The quality of the rendered image reflects the correctness of the selected depth, as the closer it is to the real depth, the clearer the rendered image is. We introduce a fog volume representation to collect these depth hints from the fog. We construct the fog volume by stacking images rendered with depths computed from disparity candidates that are also used to build the cost volume. We fuse the fog volume with cost volume to rectify the ambiguous matching caused by fog. Experiments show that our fog volume representation significantly promotes the SOTA result on foggy scenes by 10% ~ 30% while maintaining a comparable performance in clear scenes."}

It is of great application significance but still lacks a unified solution framework. An intuitive solution is to incorporate an object detection branch into an existing gaze prediction method. However, previous gaze prediction methods usually use two different networks to extract features from scene image and head image, which would lead to heavy network architecture and prevent each branch from joint optimization. In this paper, we build a novel framework named GaTector to tackle the gaze object prediction problem in a unified way. Particularly, a specific-general-specific (SGS) feature extractor is firstly proposed to utilize a shared backbone to extract general features for both scene and head images. To better consider the specificity of inputs and tasks, SGS introduces two input-specific blocks before the shared backbone and three task-specific blocks after the shared backbone. Specifically, a novel Defocus layer is designed to generate object-specific features for the object detection task without losing information or requiring extra computations. Moreover, the energy aggregation loss is introduced to guide the gaze heatmap to concentrate on the stared box. In the end, we propose a novel wUoC metric that can reveal the difference between boxes even when they share no overlapping area.

For the sake of practicality, a thorough investigation of the architecture design of learned image compression, regarding both compression performance and running speed, is essential. In this paper, we first propose uneven channel-conditional adaptive coding, motivated by the observation of energy compaction in learned image compression. Combining the proposed uneven grouping model with existing context models, we obtain a spatial-channel contextual adaptive model to improve the coding performance without damage to running speed. Then we study the structure of the main transform and propose an efficient model, ELIC, to achieve state-of-the-art speed and compression ability. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports extremely fast preview decoding and progressive decoding, which makes the coming application of learning-based image compression more promising."}

A challenging issue in Transformer design is that global self-attention is very expensive to compute whereas local self-attention often limits the field of interactions of each token. To address this issue, we develop the Cross-Shaped Window self-attention mechanism for computing self-attention in the horizontal and vertical stripes in parallel that form a cross-shaped window, with each stripe obtained by splitting the input feature into stripes of equal width. We provide a mathematical analysis of the effect of the stripe width and vary the stripe width for different layers of the Transformer network which achieves strong modeling capability while limiting the computation cost. We also introduce Locally-enhanced Positional Encoding (LePE), which handles the local positional information better than existing encoding schemes. LePE naturally supports arbitrary input resolutions and is thus especially effective and friendly for downstream tasks. Incorporated with these designs and a hierarchical structure, CSWin Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on common vision tasks. Specifically, it achieves 85.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra training data or label, 53.9 box AP and 46.4 mask AP on the COCO detection task, and 51.7 mIOU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art Swin Transformer backbone by +1.2, +2.0, +1.4, and +2.0 respectively under the similar FLOPs setting.

The task of STVQA requires models to reason over different modalities. Thus, we first investigate the impact of each modality, and reveal the importance of the language module, especially when enriched with layout information. Accounting for this, we propose a single objective pre-training scheme that requires only text and spatial cues. We show that applying this pre-training scheme on scanned documents has certain advantages over using natural images, despite the domain gap. Scanned documents are easy to procure, text-dense and have a variety of layouts, helping the model learn various spatial cues (e.g. left-of, below etc.) by tying together language and layout information. Compared to existing approaches, our method performs vocabulary-free decoding and, as shown, generalizes well beyond the training vocabulary. We further demonstrate that LaTr improves robustness towards OCR errors, a common reason for failure cases in STVQA. In addition, by leveraging a vision transformer, we eliminate the need for an external object detector. LaTr outperforms state-of-the-art STVQA methods on multiple datasets. In particular, +7.6% on TextVQA, +10.8% on ST-VQA and +4.0% on OCR-VQA (all absolute accuracy numbers)."}

In this paper, we attempt to unfold an important factor that hinders the networks from generalizing across domains: through the lens of shortcut learning. We demonstrate that the learning of feature representations in stereo matching networks is heavily influenced by synthetic data artefacts (shortcut attributes). To mitigate this issue, we propose an Information-Theoretic Shortcut Avoidance (ITSA) approach to automatically restrict shortcut-related information from being encoded into the feature representations. As a result, our proposed method learns robust and shortcut-invariant features by minimizing the sensitivity of latent features to input variations. To avoid the prohibitive computational cost of direct input sensitivity optimization, we propose an effective yet feasible algorithm to achieve robustness. We show that using this method, state-of-the-art stereo matching networks that are trained purely on synthetic data can effectively generalize to challenging and previously unseen real data scenarios. Importantly, the proposed method enhances the robustness of the synthetic trained networks to the point that they outperform their fine-tuned counterparts (on real data) for challenging out-of-domain stereo datasets."}

It can render high fidelity head images in real-time on modern GPUs, and supports directly controlling the generated images' rendering pose and various semantic attributes. Different from existing related parametric models, we use the neural radiance fields as a novel 3D proxy instead of the traditional 3D textured mesh, which makes that HeadNeRF is able to generate high fidelity images. However, the computationally expensive rendering process of the original NeRF hinders the construction of the parametric NeRF model. To address this issue, we adopt the strategy of integrating 2D neural rendering to the rendering process of NeRF and design novel loss terms. As a result, the rendering speed of HeadNeRF can be significantly accelerated, and the rendering time of one frame is reduced from 5s to 25ms. The well designed loss terms also improve the rendering accuracy, and the fine-level details of the human head, such as the gaps between teeth, wrinkles, and beards, can be represented and synthesized by HeadNeRF.

In this paper, we present a simple yet effective transformer-based architecture for scene text detection. Different from previous approaches that learn robust deep representations of scene text in a holistic manner, our method performs scene text detection based on a few representative features, which avoids the disturbance by background and reduces the computational cost. Specifically, we first select a few representative features at all scales that are highly relevant to foreground text. Then, we adopt a transformer for modeling the relationship of the sampled features, which effectively divides them into reasonable groups. As each feature group corresponds to a text instance, its bounding box can be easily obtained without any post-processing operation. Using the basic feature pyramid network for feature extraction, our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several popular datasets for scene text detection."}

In this work, we introduce WebQA, a challenging new benchmark that proves difficult for large-scale state-of-the-art models which lack language groundable visual representations for novel objects and the ability to reason, yet trivial for humans. WebQA mirrors the way humans use the web: 1) Ask a question, 2) Choose sources to aggregate, and 3) Produce a fluent language response. This is the behavior we should be expecting from IoT devices and digital assistants. Existing work prefers to assume that a model can either reason about knowledge in images or in text. WebQA includes a secondary text-only QA task to ensure improved visual performance does not come at the cost of language understanding. Our challenge for the community is to create unified multimodal reasoning models that answer questions regardless of the source modality, moving us closer to digital assistants that not only query language knowledge, but also the richer visual online world."}

In this study, we redesign BasicVSR by proposing second-order grid propagation and flow-guided deformable alignment. We show that by empowering the recurrent framework with enhanced propagation and alignment, one can exploit spatiotemporal information across misaligned video frames more effectively. The new components lead to an improved performance under a similar computational constraint. In particular, our model BasicVSR++ surpasses BasicVSR by a significant 0.82 dB in PSNR with similar number of parameters.

While existing unsupervised methods are able to learn image denoising without ground-truth clean images, they either show poor performance or work under impractical settings (e.g., paired noisy images). In this paper, we present a practical unsupervised image denoising method to achieve state-of-the-art denoising performance. Our method only requires single noisy images and a noise model, which is easily accessible in practical raw image denoising. It performs two steps iteratively: (1) Constructing a noisier-noisy dataset with random noise from the noise model; (2) training a model on the noisier-noisy dataset and using the trained model to refine noisy images to obtain the targets used in the next round. We further approximate our full iterative method with a fast algorithm for more efficient training while keeping its original high performance. Experiments on real-world, synthetic, and correlated noise show that our proposed unsupervised denoising approach has superior performances over existing unsupervised methods and competitive performance with supervised methods. In addition, we argue that existing denoising datasets are of low quality and contain only a small number of scenes. To evaluate raw image denoising performance in real-world applications, we build a high-quality raw image dataset SenseNoise-500 that contains 500 real-life scenes. The dataset can serve as a strong benchmark for better evaluating raw image denoising. Code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/zhangyi-3/IDR"}

Typically, the architectures of the backbone, feature pyramid layer, and detection head module within the face detector all assimilate the excellent experience from general object detectors. However, several effective methods, including label assignment and scale-level data augmentation strategy, fail to maintain consistent superiority when applying on the face detector directly. Concretely, the former strategy involves a vast body of hyper-parameters and the latter one suffers from the challenge of scale distribution bias between different detection tasks, which both limit their generalization abilities. Furthermore, in order to provide accurate face bounding boxes for facial down-stream tasks, the face detector imperatively requires the elimination of false alarms. As a result, practical solutions on label assignment, scale-level data augmentation, and reducing false alarms are necessary for advancing face detectors. In this paper, we focus on resolving three aforementioned challenges that exiting methods are difficult to finish off and present a novel face detector, termed MogFace. In our Mogface, three key components, Adaptive Online Incremental Anchor Mining Strategy, Selective Scale Enhancement Strategy and Hierarchical Context-Aware Module, are separately proposed to boost the performance of face detectors. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, our MogFace is the best face detector on the Wider Face leader-board, achieving all champions across different testing scenarios.

However, most state-of-the-art methods rely on static convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are not flexible enough for capturing the dynamic nature of input contexts. In this paper, we propose GuideFormer, a fully transformer-based architecture for dense depth completion. We first process sparse depth and color guidance images with separate transformer branches to extract hierarchical and complementary token representations. Each branch consists of a stack of self-attention blocks and has key design features to make our model suitable for the task. We also devise an effective token fusion method based on guided-attention mechanism. It explicitly models information flow between the two branches and captures inter-modal dependencies that cannot be obtained from depth or color image alone. These properties allow GuideFormer to enjoy various visual dependencies and recover precise depth values while preserving fine details. We evaluate GuideFormer on the KITTI dataset containing real-world driving scenes and provide extensive ablation studies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."}

Due to the high training efficiency, end-to-end solutions for WSSS have received increasing attention from the community. However, current methods are mainly based on convolutional neural networks and fail to explore the global information properly, thus usually resulting in incomplete object regions. In this paper, to address the aforementioned problem, we introduce Transformers, which naturally integrate global information, to generate more integral initial pseudo labels for end-to-end WSSS. Motivated by the inherent consistency between the self-attention in Transformers and the semantic affinity, we propose an Affinity from Attention (AFA) module to learn semantic affinity from the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in Transformers. The learned affinity is then leveraged to refine the initial pseudo labels for segmentation. In addition, to efficiently derive reliable affinity labels for supervising AFA and ensure the local consistency of pseudo labels, we devise a Pixel-Adaptive Refinement module that incorporates low-level image appearance information to refine the pseudo labels. We perform extensive experiments and our method achieves 66.0% and 38.9% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets, respectively, significantly outperforming recent end-to-end methods and several multi-stage competitors.

Previous methods either employ a complex pipeline that splits the joint task into independent stages, or fuse 2D and 3D information in an \"early-fusion\" or \"late-fusion\" manner. Such one-size-fits-all approaches suffer from a dilemma of failing to fully utilize the characteristic of each modality or to maximize the inter-modality complementarity. To address the problem, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, called CamLiFlow. It consists of 2D and 3D branches with multiple bidirectional connections between them in specific layers. Different from previous work, we apply a point-based 3D branch to better extract the geometric features and design a symmetric learnable operator to fuse dense image features and sparse point features.

To fill this gap, we build a large-scale multi-scene dataset, coined as FERV39k. We analyze the important ingredients of constructing such a novel dataset in three aspects: (1) multi-scene hierarchy and expression class, (2) generation of candidate video clips, (3) trusted manual labelling process.

Our augmented environments can differ from the seen environments in three diverse aspects: style, object appearance, and object classes. Training on these edit-augmented environments prevents the agent from overfitting to existing environments and helps generalize better to new, unseen environments. Empirically, on both the Room-to-Room and the multi-lingual Room-Across-Room datasets, we show that our proposed EnvEdit method gets significant improvements in all metrics on both pre-trained and non-pre-trained VLN agents, and achieves the new state-of-the-art on the test leaderboard.

While the majority of existing part assembly methods focus on correctly posing semantic parts to recreate a whole object, we interpret assembly more literally: as mating geometric parts together to achieve a snug fit. By focusing on shape alignment rather than semantic cues, we can achieve across category generalization and scaling. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, pairwise 3D geometric shape mating, and propose Neural Shape Mating (NSM) to tackle this problem. Given point clouds of two object parts of an unknown category, NSM learns to reason about the fit of the two parts and predict a pair of 3D poses that tightly mate them together. In addition, we couple the training of NSM with an implicit shape reconstruction task, making NSM more robust to imperfect point cloud observations. To train NSM, we present a self-supervised data collection pipeline that generates pairwise shape mating data with ground truth by randomly cutting an object mesh into two parts, resulting in a dataset that consists of 200K shape mating pairs with numerous object meshes and diverse cut types. We train NSM on the collected dataset and compare it with several point cloud registration methods and one part assembly baseline approach. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

In domain generalization, the low generalization ability for unseen target domains is clearly due to overfitting to the source domain. To address this problem, previous works have focused on generalizing the domain by removing or diversifying the styles of the source domain. These alleviated overfitting to the source-style but overlooked overfitting to the source-content. In this paper, we propose to diversify both the content and style of the source domain with the help of the wild. Our main idea is for networks to naturally learn domain-generalized semantic information from the wild. To this end, we diversify styles by augmenting source features to resemble wild styles and enable networks to adapt to a variety of styles. Furthermore, we encourage networks to learn class-discriminant features by providing semantic variations borrowed from the wild to source contents in the feature space. Finally, we regularize networks to capture consistent semantic information even when both the content and style of the source domain are extended to the wild. Extensive experiments on five different datasets validate the effectiveness of our WildNet, and we significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

However, many deep neural networks have millions or billions of parameters, making them untenable for real-world applications due to constraints on memory size or latency requirements. As a result, efficient network compression techniques are often required for a widespread adoption of deep learning methods. We present DECORE, a reinforcement learning based approach to automate the network compression process. DECORE assigns an agent to each channel in the network along with a light policy gradient method to learn which neurons or channels to be kept or removed. Each agent in the network has just one parameter (keep or drop) to learn, which leads to a much faster training process compared to existing approaches. DECORE also gives state-of-the-art compression results on various network architectures and various datasets. For example, on the ResNet-110 architecture, DECORE achieves a 64.8% compression rate and 61.8% FLOPs reduction as compared to the baseline model without any major accuracy loss on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It can reduce the size of regular architectures like the VGG network by up to 99% with just a small accuracy drop of 2.28%. For a larger dataset like ImageNet it can compress the ResNet-50 architecture by 44.7% and reduces FLOPs by 42.3%, with just a 0.69% drop on Top-5 accuracy of the uncompressed model. We also demonstrate that DECORE can be used to search for compressed network architectures based on various constraints, such as memory and FLOPs."}

In this work, we propose jointly training 3D detection and 3D tracking from only monocular videos in an end-to-end manner. The key component is a novel spatial-temporal information flow module that aggregates geometric and appearance features to predict robust similarity scores across all objects in current and past frames. Specifically, we leverage the attention mechanism of the transformer, in which self-attention aggregates the spatial information in a specific frame, and cross-attention exploits relation and affinities of all objects in the temporal domain of sequence frames. The affinities are then supervised to estimate the trajectory and guide the flow of information between corresponding 3D objects. In addition, we propose a temporal-consistency loss that explicitly involves 3D target motion modeling into the learning, making the 3D trajectory smooth in the world coordinate system. Time3D achieves 21.4% AMOTA, 13.6% AMOTP on the nuScenes 3D tracking benchmark, surpassing all published competitors, and running at 38 FPS, while Time3D achieves 31.2% mAP, 39.4% NDS on the nuScenes 3D detection benchmark."}

Although the deep neural network (DNN) enables monocular depth-sensing from high-level learned features, the pixel-level cues are usually omitted due to the deep convolution mechanism. To benefit from both the powerful feature representation in DNN and pixel-level geometric constraints, we reformulate the monocular object depth estimation as a progressive refinement problem and propose a joint semantic and geometric cost volume to model the depth error. Specifically, we first leverage neural networks to learn the object position, dimension, and dense normalized 3D object coordinates. Based on the object depth, the dense coordinates patch together with the corresponding object features is reprojected to the image space to build a cost volume in a joint semantic and geometric error manner. The final depth is obtained by feeding the cost volume to a refinement network, where the distribution of semantic and geometric error is regularized by direct depth supervision. Through effectively mitigating depth error by the refinement framework, we achieve state-of-the-art results on both the KITTI and Waymo datasets."}

Our FedDC only introduces lightweight modifications in the local training phase, in which each client utilizes an auxiliary local drift variable to track the gap between the local model parameter and the global model parameters. The key idea of FedDC is to utilize this learned local drift variable to bridge the gap, i.e., conducting consistency in parameter-level.

To alleviate this, we propose a novel Sequential Weighted Expectation-Maximization (SWEM) network to greatly reduce the redundancy of memory features. Different from the previous methods which only detect feature redundancy between frames, SWEM merges both intra-frame and inter-frame similar features by leveraging the sequential weighted EM algorithm. Further, adaptive weights for frame features endow SWEM with the flexibility to represent hard samples, improving the discrimination of templates. Besides, the proposed method maintains a fixed number of template features in memory, which ensures the stable inference complexity of the VOS system.

Contrary to this, we find that applying existing fairness approaches to computer vision improve fairness by degrading the performance of classifiers across all groups (with increased degradation on the best performing groups). Extending the bias-variance decomposition for classification to fairness, we theoretically explain why the majority of fairness methods designed for low capacity models should not be used in settings involving high-capacity models, a scenario common to computer vision. We corroborate this analysis with extensive experimental support that shows that many of the fairness heuristics used in computer vision also degrade performance on the most disadvantaged groups. Building on these insights, we propose an adaptive augmentation strategy that, uniquely, of all methods tested, improves performance for the disadvantaged groups."}

In this paper, we propose the RBGNet framework, a voting-based 3D detector for accurate 3D object detection from point clouds. In order to learn better representations of object shape to enhance cluster features for predicting 3D boxes, we propose a ray-based feature grouping module, which aggregates the point-wise features on object surfaces using a group of determined rays uniformly emitted from cluster centers. Considering the fact that foreground points are more meaningful for box estimation, we design a novel foreground biased sampling strategy in downsample process to sample more points on object surfaces and further boost the detection performance.

A standard pipeline is to extract visual features from exemplars and match them with query images to infer object counts.

Existing methods either adopt a pretrained network to represent features or learn a new one, while applying a naive similarity metric with fixed inner product. We find this paradigm leads to noisy similarity matching and hence harms counting performance. In this work, we propose a similarity-aware CAC framework that jointly learns representation and similarity metric. We first instantiate our framework with a naive baseline called Bilinear Matching Network (BMNet), whose key component is a learnable bilinear similarity metric. To further embody the core of our framework, we extend BMNet to BMNet+ that models similarity from three aspects: 1) representing the instances via their self-similarity to enhance feature robustness against intra-class variations; 2) comparing the similarity dynamically to focus on the key patterns of each exemplar; 3) learning from a supervision signal to impose explicit constraints on matching results. Extensive experiments on a recent CAC dataset FSC147 show that our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art CAC approaches.

While degradation-specific image restoration techniques have been extensively studied, such algorithms are domain sensitive and fail in real scenarios where multiple degradations exist simultaneously. This makes a case for blind image restoration and reconstruction algorithms as practically relevant. However, the absence of a dataset diverse enough to encapsulate all variations hinders development for such an algorithm. In this paper, we utilize a synthetic degradation model that recursively applies sets of random degradations to generate naturalistic degradation images of varying complexity, which are used as input. Furthermore, as the degradation intensity can vary across an image, the spatially invariant convolutional filter cannot be applied for all degradations. Hence to enable spatial variance during image restoration and reconstruction, we design a transformer-based architecture to benefit from the long-range dependencies. In addition, to reduce the computational cost of transformers, we propose a multi-branch structure coupled with modifications such as a complimentary feature selection mechanism and the replacement of a feed-forward network with lightweight multiscale convolutions. Finally, to improve restoration and reconstruction, we integrate an auxiliary decoder branch to predict the degradation mask to ensure the underlying network can localize the degradation information. From empirical analysis on 10 datasets covering rain drop removal, deraining, dehazing, image enhancement, and deblurring, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach while obtaining SoTA performance."}

Furthermore, we propose a single-image fitting framework based on differentiable rendering. Rich experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."}

Existing research on gesture recognition is limited to close-range interaction such as vehicle gesture control and face-to-face communication. To apply gesture recognition to long-distance interactive scenes such as meetings and smart homes, a large RGB-D video dataset LD-ConGR is established in this paper. LD-ConGR is distinguished from existing gesture datasets by its long-distance gesture collection, fine-grained annotations, and high video quality. Specifically, 1) the farthest gesture provided by the LD-ConGR is captured 4m away from the camera while existing gesture datasets collect gestures within 1m from the camera; 2) besides the gesture category, the temporal segmentation of gestures and hand location are also annotated in LD-ConGR; 3) videos are captured at high resolution (1280x720 for color streams and 640x576 for depth streams) and high frame rate (30 fps). On top of the LD-ConGR, a series of experimental and studies are conducted, and the proposed gesture region estimation and key frame sampling strategies are demonstrated to be effective in dealing with long-distance gesture recognition and the uncertainty of gesture duration. The dataset and experimental results presented in this paper are expected to boost the research of long-distance gesture recognition.

While these methods exhibit good performance, the diversity of the questions and answers are constrained by the available image set. In this work we explore using synthetic computer-generated data to fully control the visual and language space, allowing us to provide more diverse scenarios. We quantify the effect of synthetic data in real-world VQA benchmarks and to which extent it produces results that generalize to real data. By exploiting 3D and physics simulation platforms, we provide a pipeline to generate synthetic data to expand and replace type-specific questions and answers without risking the exposure of sensitive or personal data that might be present in real images. We offer a comprehensive analysis while expanding existing hyper-realistic datasets to be used for VQA. We also propose Feature Swapping (F-SWAP) -- where we randomly switch object-level features during training to make a VQA model more domain invariant. We show that F-SWAP is effective for enhancing a currently existing VQA dataset of real images without compromising on the accuracy to answer existing questions in the dataset."}

Most of the video super-resolution methods adopt the optical flow or deformable convolution for explicitly motion compensation. However, such temporal modeling techniques increase the model complexity and might fail in case of occlusion or complex motion, resulting in serious distortion and artifacts. In this paper, we propose to explore the role of explicit temporal difference modeling in both LR and HR space. Instead of directly feeding consecutive frames into a VSR model, we propose to compute the temporal difference between frames and divide those pixels into two subsets according to the level of difference. They are separately processed with two branches of different receptive fields in order to better extract complementary information. To further enhance the super-resolution result, not only spatial residual features are extracted, but the difference between consecutive frames in high-frequency domain is also computed. It allows the model to exploit intermediate SR results in both future and past to refine the current SR output. The difference at different time steps could be cached such that information from further distance in time could be propagated to the current frame for refinement. Experiments on several video super-resolution benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods."}

We present a novel learning framework called Uncertainty guided Cross-head Co-training (UCC) for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Our framework introduces weak and strong augmentations within a shared encoder to achieve co-training, which naturally combines the benefits of consistency and self-training. Every segmentation head interacts with its peers and, the weak augmentation result is used for supervising the strong. The consistency training samples' diversity can be boosted by Dynamic Cross-Set Copy-Paste (DCSCP), which also alleviates the distribution mismatch and class imbalance problems. Moreover, our proposed Uncertainty Guided Re-weight Module (UGRM) enhances the self-training pseudo labels by suppressing the effect of the low-quality pseudo labels from its peer via modeling uncertainty.

In this paper, we address the aforementioned problems: 1) we use a novel, volumetric hair representation that is composed of thousands of primitives. Each primitive can be rendered efficiently, yet realistically, by building on the latest advances in neural rendering. 2) To have a reliable control signal, we present a novel way of tracking hair on strand level. To keep the computational effort manageable, we use guide hairs and classic techniques to expand those into a dense head of hair. 3) To better enforce temporal consistency and generalization ability of our model, we further optimize the 3D scene flow of our representation with multiview optical flow, using volumetric raymarching. Our method can not only create realistic renders of recorded multi-view sequences, but also create renderings for new hair configurations by providing new control signals.

In this paper, we propose an iterative correcting approach operating in 3D space, that is designed to learn on 2.5D data by enabling 3D point convolutions to correct the points' positions along the view direction. As labeled real world data is scarce for this task, we further train our network with a self-training approach on unlabeled real world data to account for real world statistics.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) calibration techniques improve on the confidence of predicted labels alone, and leave the confidence of non-max classes (e.g. top-2, top-5) uncalibrated. Such calibration is not suitable for label refinement using post-processing. Further, most SOTA techniques learn a few hyper-parameters post-hoc, leaving out the scope for image, or pixel specific calibration. This makes them unsuitable for calibration under domain shift, or for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. In this paper, we argue for intervening at the train time itself, so as to directly produce calibrated DNN models. We propose a novel auxiliary loss function: Multi-class Difference in Confidence and Accuracy (MDCA), to achieve the same. MDCA can be used in conjunction with other application/task specific loss functions. We show that training with MDCA leads to better calibrated models in terms of Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and Static Calibration Error (SCE) on image classification, and segmentation tasks. We report ECE(SCE) score of 0.72 (1.60) on the CIFAR100 dataset, in comparison to 1.90 (1.71) by the SOTA. Under domain shift, a ResNet-18 model trained on PACS dataset using MDCA gives a average ECE(SCE) score of 19.7 (9.7) across all domains, compared to 24.2 (11.8) by the SOTA. For segmentation task, we report a 2x reduction in calibration error on PASCAL-VOC dataset in comparison to Focal Loss. Finally, MDCA training improves calibration even on imbalanced data, and for natural language classification tasks."}

However, it is questionable whether such potential has been fully unleashed in practice, as the learned ViTs often suffer from over-smoothening, yielding likely redundant models. Recent works made preliminary attempts to identify and alleviate such redundancy, e.g., via regularizing embedding similarity or re-injecting convolution-like structures. However, a \"head-to-toe assessment\" regarding the extent of redundancy in ViTs, and how much we could gain by thoroughly mitigating such, has been absent for this field. This paper, for the first time, systematically studies the ubiquitous existence of redundancy at all three levels: patch embedding, attention map, and weight space. In view of them, we advocate a principle of diversity for training ViTs, by presenting corresponding regularizers that encourage the representation diversity and coverage at each of those levels, that enabling capturing more discriminative information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet with a number of ViT backbones validate the effectiveness of our proposals, largely eliminating the observed ViT redundancy and significantly boosting the model generalization. For example, our diversified DeiT obtains 0.70% 1.76% accuracy boosts on ImageNet with highly reduced similarity. Our codes are fully available in https://github.com/VITA-Group/Diverse-ViT."}

However, the immense diversity of the OOD examples makes such methods fragile. There are OOD samples that are easy to identify in the feature space while hard to distinguish in the logit space and vice versa. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel OOD scoring method named Virtual-logit Matching (ViM), which combines the class-agnostic score from feature space and the In-Distribution (ID) class-dependent logits. Specifically, an additional logit representing the virtual OOD class is generated from the residual of the feature against the principal space, and then matched with the original logits by a constant scaling. The probability of this virtual logit after softmax is the indicator of OOD-ness. To facilitate the evaluation of large-scale OOD detection in academia, we create a new OOD dataset for ImageNet-1K, which is human-annotated and is 8.8x the size of existing datasets. We conducted extensive experiments, including CNNs and vision transformers, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ViM score. In particular, using the BiT-S model, our method gets an average AUROC 90.91% on four difficult OOD benchmarks, which is 4% ahead of the best baseline.

In this paper, we propose a framework based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) for object pose refinement, which is robust to erroneous initial poses and occlusions. During the recurrent iterations, object pose refinement is formulated as a non-linear least squares problem based on the estimated correspondence field (between a rendered image and the observed image). The problem is then solved by a differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm enabling end-to-end training. The correspondence field estimation and pose refinement are conducted alternatively in each iteration to recover the object poses. Furthermore, to improve the robustness to occlusion, we introduce a consistency-check mechanism based on the learned descriptors of the 3D model and observed 2D images, which downweights the unreliable correspondences during pose optimization. Extensive experiments on LINEMOD, Occlusion-LINEMOD, and YCB-Video datasets validate the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance."}

Different group activities often show the diversified interactions between actors in the video. Hence, it is often difficult to model complex group activities from a single view of spatial-temporal actor evolution. To tackle this problem, we propose a distinct Dual-path Actor Interaction (Dual-AI) framework, which flexibly arranges spatial and temporal transformers in two complementary orders, enhancing actor relations by integrating merits from different spatio-temporal paths. Moreover, we introduce a novel Multi-scale Actor Contrastive Loss (MAC-Loss) between two interactive paths of Dual-AI. Via self-supervised actor consistency in both frame and video levels, MAC-Loss can effectively distinguish individual actor representations to reduce action confusion among different actors. Consequently, our Dual-AI can boost group activity recognition by fusing such discriminative features of different actors. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the widely used benchmarks, including Volleyball, Collective Activity, and NBA datasets. The proposed Dual-AI achieves state-of-the-art performance on all these datasets. It is worth noting the proposed Dual-AI with 50% training data outperforms a number of recent approaches with 100% training data. This confirms the generalization power of Dual-AI for group activity recognition, even under the challenging scenarios of limited supervision."}

Disentangling images into semantic content factors and transformations can provide significant benefits into many domain-specific image analysis tasks. To this end, we propose a generic unsupervised framework, Harmony, that simultaneously and explicitly disentangles semantic content from multiple parameterized transformations. Harmony leverages a simple cross-contrastive learning framework with multiple explicitly parameterized latent representations to disentangle content from transformations. To demonstrate the efficacy of Harmony, we apply it to disentangle image semantic content from several parameterized transformations (rotation, translation, scaling, and contrast). Harmony achieves significantly improved disentanglement over the baseline models on several image datasets of diverse domains. With such disentanglement, Harmony is demonstrated to incentivize bioimage analysis research by modeling structural heterogeneity of macromolecules from cryo-ET images and learning transformation-invariant representations of protein particles from single-particle cryo-EM images. Harmony also performs very well in disentangling content from 3D transformations and can perform coarse and fast alignment of 3D cryo-ET subtomograms. Therefore, Harmony is generalizable to many other imaging domains and can potentially be extended to domains beyond imaging as well."}

Therefore, they tend to return certain patterns of the dance genres that they are familiar with. What if artificial intelligence could be used to help choreographers blend dance genres by suggesting various dances, and one that matches their choreographic style? Numerous task-specific variants of autoregressive networks have been developed for dance generation. Yet, a serious limitation remains that all existing algorithms can return repeated patterns for a given initial pose sequence, which may be inferior. To mitigate this issue, we propose MNET, a novel and scalable approach that can perform music-conditioned pluralistic dance generation synthesized by multiple dance genres using only a single model. Here, we learn a dance-genre aware latent representation by training a conditional generative adversarial network leveraging Transformer architecture. We conduct extensive experiments on AIST++ along with user studies.

Previous works that study this question only adopt developments in image synthesis and convert voices into face images to show correlations, but working on the image domain unavoidably involves predicting attributes that voices cannot hint, including facial textures, hairstyles, and backgrounds. We instead investigate the ability to reconstruct 3D faces to concentrate on only geometry, which is much more physiologically grounded. We propose our analysis framework, Cross-Modal Perceptionist, under both supervised and unsupervised learning. First, we construct a dataset, Voxceleb-3D, which extends Voxceleb and includes paired voices and face meshes, making supervised learning possible. Second, we use a knowledge distillation mechanism to study whether face geometry can still be gleaned from voices without paired voices and 3D face data under limited availability of 3D face scans. We break down the core question into four parts and perform visual and numerical analyses as responses to the core question. Our findings echo those in physiology and neuroscience about the correlation between voices and facial structures.

We propose to resolve this issue by using a spatial-temporal transformer that naturally incorporates the spatial and temporal super resolution modules into a single model. Unlike CNN-based methods, we do not explicitly use separated building blocks for temporal interpolations and spatial super-resolutions; instead, we only use a single end-to-end transformer architecture. Specifically, a reusable dictionary is built by encoders based on the input LFR and LR frames, which is then utilized in the decoder part to synthesize the HFR and HR frames.

One potential reason is that standard volumetric rendering does not enforce the constraint that most of a scene's geometry consist of empty space and opaque surfaces. We formalize the above assumption through DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth supervision. We leverage the fact that current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that can be used as \"free\" depth supervision during training: we add a loss to encourage the distribution of a ray's terminating depth matches a given 3D keypoint, incorporating depth uncertainty. DS-NeRF can render better images given fewer training views while training 2-3x faster. Further, we show that our loss is compatible with other recently proposed NeRF methods, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible supervisory signal. And finally, we find that DS-NeRF can support other types of depth supervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGBD reconstruction outputs."}

Hands have been separately studied, but the focus has been on generating realistic static grasps of objects. To synthesize virtual characters that interact with the world, we need to generate full-body motions and realistic hand grasps simultaneously. Both sub-problems are challenging on their own and, together, the state space of poses is significantly larger, the scales of hand and body motions differ, and the whole-body posture and the hand grasp must agree, satisfy physical constraints, and be plausible. Additionally, the head is involved because the avatar must look at the object to interact with it. For the first time, we address the problem of generating full-body, hand and head motions of an avatar grasping an unknown object. As input, our method, called GOAL, takes a 3D object, its pose, and a starting 3D body pose and shape. GOAL outputs a sequence of whole-body poses using two novel networks. First, GNet generates a goal whole-body grasp with a realistic body, head, arm, and hand pose, as well as hand-object contact. Second, MNet generates the motion between the starting and goal pose. This is challenging, as it requires the avatar to walk towards the object with foot-ground contact, orient the head towards it, reach out, and grasp it with a realistic hand pose and hand-object contact. To achieve this the networks exploit a representation that combines SMPL-X body parameters and 3D vertex offsets. We train and evaluate GOAL, both qualitatively and quantitatively, on the GRAB dataset. Results show that GOAL generalizes well to unseen objects, outperforming baselines. A perceptual study shows that GOAL's generated motions approach the realism of GRAB's ground truth. GOAL takes a step towards generating realistic full-body object grasping motion.

To circumvent this problem, category-level object pose estimation has recently been revamped, which aims at predicting the 6D pose as well as the 3D metric size for previously unseen instances from a given set of object classes. This is, however, a much more challenging task due to severe intra-class shape variations. To address this issue, we propose GPV-Pose, a novel framework for robust category-level pose estimation, harnessing geometric insights to enhance the learning of category-level pose-sensitive features. First, we introduce a decoupled confidence-driven rotation representation, which allows geometry-aware recovery of the associated rotation matrix. Second, we propose a novel geometry-guided point-wise voting paradigm for robust retrieval of the 3D object bounding box. Finally, leveraging these different output streams, we can enforce several geometric consistency terms, further increasing performance, especially for non-symmetric categories.

Eyes cannot be clearly seen in such cases due to occlusion and lacking resolution. Existing gaze estimation methods suffer or fall back to approximating gaze with head pose as they primarily rely on clear, close-up views of the eyes. Our key idea is to instead leverage the intrinsic gaze, head, and body coordination of people. Our method formulates gaze estimation as Bayesian prediction given temporal estimates of head and body orientations which can be reliably estimated from a far. We model the head and body orientation likelihoods and the conditional prior of gaze direction on those with separate neural networks which are then cascaded to output the 3D gaze direction. We introduce an extensive new dataset that consists of surveillance videos annotated with 3D gaze directions captured in 5 indoor and outdoor scenes.

However, such a dataset is prohibitively expensive in 3D computer vision due to the substantial collection cost. To alleviate this issue, we propose a cost-effective method for automatically generating a large amount of 3D objects with annotations. In particular, we synthesize objects simply by assembling multiple random primitives. These objects are thus auto-annotated with part-based labels originating from primitives. This allows us to perform multi-task learning by combining the supervised segmentation with unsupervised reconstruction. Considering the large overhead of learning on the generated dataset, we further propose a dataset distillation strategy to remove redundant samples regarding a target dataset. We conduct extensive experiments for the downstream tasks of 3D object classification. The results indicate that our dataset, together with multi-task pretraining on its annotations, achieves the best performance compared to other commonly used datasets. Further study suggests that our strategy can improve the model performance by pretraining and fine-tuning scheme, especially for a dataset with a small scale. In addition, pretraining with the proposed dataset distillation method can save 86% of the pretraining time with negligible performance degradation.

We create a graph in which images and separated sounds each correspond to nodes, and train a random walker to transition between nodes from different modalities with high return probability. The transition probabilities for this walk are determined by an audio-visual similarity metric that is learned by our model. We show through experiments with musical instruments and human speech that our model can successfully localize multiple sounds, outperforming other self-supervised methods."}

Recent works achieve good performance relying on a large amount of expensive-to-obtain labeled data. To reduce the amount of supervision, we for the first time propose a general framework, FisherMatch, for semi-supervised rotation regression, without assuming any domain-specific knowledge or paired data. Inspired by the popular semi-supervised approach, FixMatch, we propose to leverage pseudo label filtering to facilitate the information flow from labeled data to unlabeled data in a teacher-student mutual learning framework. However, incorporating the pseudo label filtering mechanism into semi-supervised rotation regression is highly non-trivial, mainly due to the lack of a reliable confidence measure for rotation prediction. In this work, we propose to leverage matrix Fisher distribution to build a probabilistic model of rotation and devise a matrix Fisher-based regressor for jointly predicting rotation along with its prediction uncertainty. We then propose to use the entropy of the predicted distribution as a confidence measure, which enables us to perform pseudo label filtering for rotation regression. For supervising such distribution-like pseudo labels, we further investigate the problem of how to enforce loss between two matrix Fisher distributions. Our extensive experiments show that our method can work well even under very low labeled data ratios on different benchmarks, achieving significant and consistent performance improvement over supervised learning and other semi-supervised learning baselines.

By predicting the descriptors with a single pass through the source images, we lift the requirement of per-scene optimization while also making the neural descriptors view-dependent and more suitable for scenes with strong non-Lambertian effects. In our comparisons, the proposed system outperforms previous NVS approaches in terms of fitting and rendering runtimes while producing images of similar quality."}

However, the model performance may be degraded when applied to fine-grained data, due to limited training samples and subtle distinction among categories. Different from generic GANs, we address the issue from a new perspective of discovering and utilizing the underlying structure of real data to explicitly regularize the spatial organization of latent space. To reduce the dependence of generative models on labeled data, we propose a semi-supervised hyper-spherical GAN for class-conditional fine-grained image generation, and our model is referred to as SphericGAN. By projecting random vectors drawn from a prior distribution onto a hyper-sphere, we can model more complex distributions, while at the same time the similarity between the resulting latent vectors depends only on the angle, but not on their magnitudes. On the other hand, we also incorporate a mapping network to map real images onto the hyper-sphere, and match latent vectors with the underlying structure of real data via real-fake cluster alignment. As a result, we obtain a spatially organized latent space, which is useful for capturing class-independent variation factors. The experimental results suggest that our SphericGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing high-fidelity images with precise class semantics."}

We develop a new separation boundary and diffuse method to generate paired training data for males, and a novel \"female-male-bald\" pipeline for paired data of females. Experiments show that our method can naturally deal with portrait images with variations on gender, age, etc. We validate the superior performance of our method by comparing it to state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments and user studies. We also demonstrate its applications in hair design and 3D face reconstruction."}

However, organs move and deform as the patient changes his/her pose. In order to obtain accurate target location information, clinicians have to either conduct frequent intraoperative scans, resulting in higher exposition of patients to radiations, or adopt proxy procedures (e.g., creating and using custom molds to keep patients in the exact same pose during both preoperative organ scanning and subsequent treatment. Such custom proxy methods are typically sub-optimal, constraining the clinicians and costing precious time and money to the patients. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present a learning-based approach to estimate the patient's internal organ deformation for arbitrary human poses in order to assist with radiotherapy and similar medical protocols. The underlying method first leverages medical scans to learn a patient-specific representation that potentially encodes the organ's shape and elastic properties. During inference, given the patient's current body pose information and the organ's representation extracted from previous medical scans, our method can estimate their current organ deformation to offer guidance to clinicians. We conduct experiments on a well-sized dataset which is augmented through real clinical data using finite element modeling. Our results suggest that pose-dependent organ deformation can be learned through a point cloud autoencoder conditioned on the parametric pose input. We hope that this work can be a starting point for future research towards closing the loop between human mesh recovery and anatomical reconstruction, with applications beyond the medical domain."}

However, in terms of speed and accuracy, existing LiDAR methods in the field are still limited. In this paper, we propose a fast and high-performance LiDAR-based framework, referred to as Panoptic-PHNet, with three attractive aspects: 1) We introduce a clustering pseudo heatmap as a new paradigm, which, followed by a center grouping module, yields instance centers for efficient clustering without object-level learning tasks. 2) A knn-transformer module is proposed to model the interaction among foreground points for accurate offset regression. 3) For backbone design, we fuse the fine-grained voxel features and the 2D Bird's Eye View (BEV) features with different receptive fields to utilize both detailed and global information. Extensive experiments on both SemanticKITTI dataset and nuScenes dataset show that our Panoptic-PHNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins with a real-time speed. We achieve the 1st place on the public leaderboard of SemanticKITTI and leading performance on the recently released leaderboard of nuScenes."}

This model classifies input images by comparing them with prototypes learned during training, yielding explanations in the form of \"this looks like that.\" However, while previous methods use spatially rigid prototypes, we address this shortcoming by proposing spatially flexible prototypes. Each prototype is made up of several prototypical parts that adaptively change their relative spatial positions depending on the input image. Consequently, a Deformable ProtoPNet can explicitly capture pose variations and context, improving both model accuracy and the richness of explanations provided.

Following BERT, we devise a Masked Point Modeling (MPM) task to pre-train point cloud Transformers. Specifically, we first divide a point cloud into several local patches, and a point cloud Tokenizer is devised via a discrete Variational AutoEncoder (dVAE) to generate discrete point tokens containing meaningful local information. Then, we randomly mask some patches of input point clouds and feed them into the backbone Transformer. The pre-training objective is to recover the original point tokens at the masked locations under the supervision of point tokens obtained by the Tokenizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BERT-style pre-training strategy significantly improves the performance of standard point cloud Transformers. Equipped with our pre-training strategy, we show that a pure Transformer architecture attains 93.7% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 83.1% accuracy on the hardest setting of ScanObjectNN, surpassing carefully designed point cloud models with much fewer hand-made designs and human priors. We also demonstrate that the representations learned by Point-BERT transfer well to new tasks and domains, where our models largely advance the state-of-the-art of few-shot point cloud classification task."}

Recently, another class of neural architectures, Transformers, have shown significant performance gains on natural language and high-level vision tasks. While the Transformer model mitigates the shortcomings of CNNs (i.e., limited receptive field and inadaptability to input content), its computational complexity grows quadratically with the spatial resolution, therefore making it infeasible to apply to most image restoration tasks involving high-resolution images. In this work, we propose an efficient Transformer model by making several key designs in the building blocks (multi-head attention and feed-forward network) such that it can capture long-range pixel interactions, while still remaining applicable to large images. Our model, named Restoration Transformer (Restormer), achieves state-of-the-art results on several image restoration tasks, including image deraining, single-image motion deblurring, defocus deblurring (single-image and dual-pixel data), and image denoising (Gaussian grayscale/color denoising, and real image denoising).

Compared with low-resolution videos, high-resolution videos contain richer appearance (spatial) information and more complex motion (temporal) information. In this paper, we propose a Spatiotemporal Residual Predictive Model (STRPM) for high-resolution video prediction. On the one hand, we propose a Spatiotemporal Encoding-Decoding Scheme to preserve more spatiotemporal information for high-resolution videos. In this way, the appearance details for each frame can be greatly preserved. On the other hand, we design a Residual Predictive Memory (RPM) which focuses on modeling the spatiotemporal residual features (STRF) between previous and future frames instead of the whole frame, which can greatly help capture the complex motion information in high-resolution videos. In addition, the proposed RPM can supervise the spatial encoder and temporal encoder to extract different features in the spatial domain and the temporal domain, respectively. Moreover, the proposed model is trained using generative adversarial networks (GANs) with a learned perceptual loss (LP-loss) to improve the perceptual quality of the predictions. Experimental results show that STRPM can generate more satisfactory results compared with various existing methods."}

Yet most existing approaches for learning spatio-temporal representations rely on manually trimmed videos, leading to limited diversity in visual patterns and limited performance gain. In this work, we aim to learn representations by leveraging more abundant information in untrimmed videos. To this end, we propose to learn a hierarchy of consistencies in videos, i.e., visual consistency and topical consistency, corresponding respectively to clip pairs that tend to be visually similar when separated by a short time span and share similar topics when separated by a long time span. Specifically, a hierarchical consistency learning framework HiCo is presented, where the visually consistent pairs are encouraged to have the same representation through contrastive learning, while the topically consistent pairs are coupled through a topical classifier that distinguishes whether they are topicrelated. Further, we impose a gradual sampling algorithm for proposed hierarchical consistency learning, and demonstrate its theoretical superiority. Empirically, we show that not only HiCo can generate stronger representations on untrimmed videos, it also improves the representation quality when applied to trimmed videos. This is in contrast to standard contrastive learning that fails to learn appropriate representations from untrimmed videos."}

Once one or multiple atlases from an image population have been constructed, commonly (1) images are warped into an atlas space to study intra-subject or inter-subject variations or (2) a possibly probabilistic atlas is warped into image space to assign anatomical labels. Atlas estimation and nonparametric transformations are computationally expensive as they usually require numerical optimization. Additionally, previous approaches for atlas building often define similarity measures between a fuzzy atlas and each individual image, which may cause alignment difficulties because a fuzzy atlas does not exhibit clear anatomical structures in contrast to the individual images. This work explores using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to jointly predict the atlas and a stationary velocity field (SVF) parameterization for diffeomorphic image registration with respect to the atlas. Our approach does not require affine pre-registrations and utilizes pairwise image alignment losses to increase registration accuracy. We evaluate our model on 3D knee magnetic resonance images (MRI) from the OAI-ZIB dataset. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art image registration algorithms, allows for end-to-end training, and for fast inference at test time."}

In this work, we devise an efficient encoder-decoder based network, termed IFRNet, for fast intermediate frame synthesizing. It first extracts pyramid features from given inputs, and then refines the bilateral intermediate flow fields together with a powerful intermediate feature until generating the desired output. The gradually refined intermediate feature can not only facilitate intermediate flow estimation, but also compensate for contextual details, making IFRNet do not need additional synthesis or refinement module. To fully release its potential, we further propose a novel task-oriented optical flow distillation loss to focus on learning the useful teacher knowledge towards frame synthesizing. Meanwhile, a new geometry consistency regularization term is imposed on the gradually refined intermediate features to keep better structure layout.

In this paper, we propose to leverage the feature of a model trained on large-scale datasets to deal with the domain shift since it has seen various styles of images. With the cosine similarity based cost volume as a bridge, the feature will be grafted to an ordinary cost aggregation module. Despite the broad-spectrum representation, such a low-level feature contains much general information which is not aimed at stereo matching. To recover more task-specific information, the grafted feature is further input into a shallow network to be transformed before calculating the cost. Extensive experiments show that the model generalization ability can be improved significantly with this broad-spectrum and task-oriented feature. Specifically, based on two well-known architectures PSMNet and GANet, our methods are superior to other robust algorithms when transferring from SceneFlow to KITTI 2015, KITTI 2012, and Middlebury.

For obtaining optimal physical adversarial camouflage, previous studies have utilized the so-called neural renderer, as it supports differentiability. However, existing neural renderers cannot fully represent various real-world transformations due to a lack of control of scene parameters compared to the legacy photo-realistic renderers. In this paper, we propose the Differentiable Transformation Attack (DTA), a framework for generating a robust physical adversarial pattern on a target object to camouflage it against object detection models with a wide range of transformations. It utilizes our novel Differentiable Transformation Network (DTN), which learns the expected transformation of a rendered object when the texture is changed while preserving the original properties of the target object. Using our attack framework, an adversary can gain both the advantages of the legacy photo-realistic renderers including various physical-world transformations and the benefit of white-box access by offering differentiability. Our experiments show that our camouflaged 3D vehicles can successfully evade state-of-the-art object detection models in the photo-realistic environment (i.e., CARLA on Unreal Engine). Furthermore, our demonstration on a scaled Tesla Model 3 proves the applicability and transferability of our method to the real world."}

This requires a large amount of densely annotated video data, which is costly to annotate, and largely redundant since frames within a video are highly correlated. In light of this, we propose HODOR: a novel method that tackles VOS by effectively leveraging annotated static images for understanding object appearance and scene context. We encode object instances and scene information from an image frame into robust high-level descriptors which can then be used to re-segment those objects in different frames. As a result, HODOR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DAVIS and YouTube-VOS benchmarks compared to existing methods trained without video annotations. Without any architectural modification, HODOR can also learn from video context around single annotated video frames by utilizing cyclic consistency, whereas other methods rely on dense, temporally consistent annotations."}

However, their annotation process is labor-intensive and needs expert supervision. Current unsupervised semantic embeddings, i.e., word embeddings, enable knowledge transfer between classes. However, word embeddings do not always reflect visual similarities and result in inferior zero-shot performance. We propose to discover semantic embeddings containing discriminative visual properties for zero-shot learning, without requiring any human annotation. Our model visually divides a set of images from seen classes into clusters of local image regions according to their visual similarity, and further imposes their class discrimination and semantic relatedness. To associate these clusters with previously unseen classes, we use external knowledge, e.g., word embeddings and propose a novel class relation discovery module. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our model discovers semantic embeddings that model the visual properties of both seen and unseen classes.

However, those anomalies seen during training often do not illustrate every possible class of anomaly, rendering these models ineffective in generalizing to unseen anomaly classes. This paper tackles open-set supervised anomaly detection, in which we learn detection models using the anomaly examples with the objective to detect both seen anomalies ('gray swans') and unseen anomalies ('black swans'). We propose a novel approach that learns disentangled representations of abnormalities illustrated by seen anomalies, pseudo anomalies, and latent residual anomalies (i.e., samples that have unusual residuals compared to the normal data in a latent space), with the last two abnormalities designed to detect unseen anomalies.

It aims to use a single model to complete the translation between multiple sign languages and spoken languages. Then, we propose MLSLT, the first MSLT model, which contains two novel dynamic routing mechanisms for controlling the degree of parameter sharing between different languages. Intra-layer language-specific routing controls the proportion of data flowing through shared parameters and language-specific parameters from the token level through a soft gate within the layer, and inter-layer language-specific routing controls and learns the data flow path of different languages at the language level through a soft gate between layers. In order to evaluate the performance of MLSLT, we collect the first publicly available multilingual sign language understanding dataset, Spreadthesign-Ten (SP-10), which contains up to 100 language pairs, e.g., CSL->en, GSG->zh. Experimental results show that the average performance of MLSLT outperforms the baseline MSLT model and the combination of multiple BSLT models in many cases.

This motion synthesis consists of our modified Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and Inverse Kinematics (IK). In this VAE, our proposed sampling-near-samples method generates various valid motions even with insufficient training motion data. Our IK-based motion synthesis method allows us to generate a variety of motions semi-automatically. Since these two schemes generate unrealistic artifacts in the synthesized motions, our motion correction rectifies them. This motion correction scheme consists of imitation learning with physics simulation and subsequent motion debiasing. For this imitation learning, we propose the PD-residual force that significantly accelerates the training process. Furthermore, our motion debiasing successfully offsets the motion bias induced by imitation learning to maximize the effect of augmentation.

Most of the existing learning-based deraining methods are supervisedly trained on synthetic rainy-clean pairs. The domain gap between the synthetic and real rains makes them less generalized to different real rainy scenes. Moreover, the existing methods mainly utilize the property of the two layers independently, while few of them have considered the mutually exclusive relationship between the two layers. In this work, we propose a novel non-local contrastive learning (NLCL) method for unsupervised image deraining. Consequently, we not only utilize the intrinsic self-similarity property within samples but also the mutually exclusive property between the two layers, so as to better differ the rain layer from the clean image. Specifically, the non-local self-similarity image layer patches as the positives are pulled together and similar rain layer patches as the negatives are pushed away. Thus the similar positive/negative samples that are close in the original space benefit us to enrich more discriminative representation. Apart from the self-similarity sampling strategy, we analyze how to choose an appropriate feature encoder in NLCL. Extensive experiments on different real rainy datasets demonstrate that the proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance in real deraining."}

Moreover, these networks are typically trained to represent a signal at a single scale, so naive downsampling or upsampling results in artifacts. We introduce band-limited coordinate networks (BACON), a network architecture with an analytical Fourier spectrum. BACON has constrained behavior at unsupervised points, can be designed based on the spectral characteristics of the represented signal, and can represent signals at multiple scales without per-scale supervision.

Most methods proposed in the literature have been designed to deal with just removing one type of degradation. Recently, a CNN-based method using neural architecture search (All-in-One) was proposed to remove all the weather conditions at once. However, it has a large number of parameters as it uses multiple encoders to cater to each weather removal task and still has scope for improvement in its performance. In this work, we focus on developing an efficient solution for the all adverse weather removal problem. To this end, we propose TransWeather, a transformer-based end-to-end model with just a single encoder and a decoder that can restore an image degraded by any weather condition. Specifically, we utilize a novel transformer encoder using intra-patch transformer blocks to enhance attention inside the patches to effectively remove smaller weather degradations. We also introduce a transformer decoder with learnable weather type embeddings to adjust to the weather degradation at hand. TransWeather achieves significant improvements across multiple test datasets over both All-in-One network as well as methods fine-tuned for specific tasks.

Similar to other computer vision tasks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the workhorse for most state-of-the-art (SOTA) egocentric vision techniques. On the other hand DNNs are known to be susceptible to Adversarial Attacks (AAs) which add im-perceptible noise to the input. Both black-box, as well as white-box attacks on image as well as video analysis tasks have been shown. We observe that most AA techniques basically add intensity perturbation to an image. Even for videos, the same process is essentially repeated for each frame independently. We note that the definition of imperceptibility used for images may not be applicable for videos, where a small intensity change happening randomly in two consecutive frames may still be perceptible. In this paper we make a key novel suggestion to use perturbation in optical flow to carry out AAs on a video analysis system. Such perturbation is especially useful for egocentric videos, because there is a lot of shake in the egocentric videos anyways, and adding a little more, keeps it highly imperceptible. In general, our idea can be seen as adding structured, para-metric noise as the adversarial perturbation. Our implementation of the idea by adding 3D rotations to the frames reveal that using our technique, one can mount a black-box AA on an egocentric activity detection system in one-third of the queries compared to the SOTA AA technique."}

In contrast, this paper considers that all the detection components are important and proposes a Holistic and Hierarchical Feature Alignment (H^2FA) R-CNN. H^2FA R-CNN enforces two image-level alignments for the backbone features, as well as two instance-level alignments for the RPN and detection head. This coarse-to-fine aligning hierarchy is in pace with the detection pipeline, i.e., processing the image-level feature and the instance-level features from bottom to top. Importantly, we devise a novel hybrid supervision method for learning two instance-level alignments. It enables the RPN and detection head to simultaneously receive weak/full supervision from the target/source domains. Combining all these feature alignments, H^2FA R-CNN effectively mitigates the gap between the source and target domains. Experimental results show that H^2FA R-CNN significantly improves cross-domain object detection accuracy and sets new state of the art on popular benchmarks.

We focus on the supervised setup, in which ground-truth depth is available only at training time. Based on knowledge about the high regularity of real 3D scenes, we propose a method that learns to selectively leverage information from coplanar pixels to improve the predicted depth. In particular, we introduce a piecewise planarity prior which states that for each pixel, there is a seed pixel which shares the same planar 3D surface with the former. Motivated by this prior, we design a network with two heads. The first head outputs pixel-level plane coefficients, while the second one outputs a dense offset vector field that identifies the positions of seed pixels. The plane coefficients of seed pixels are then used to predict depth at each position. The resulting prediction is adaptively fused with the initial prediction from the first head via a learned confidence to account for potential deviations from precise local planarity. The entire architecture is trained end-to-end thanks to the differentiability of the proposed modules and it learns to predict regular depth maps, with sharp edges at occlusion boundaries. An extensive evaluation of our method shows that we set the new state of the art in supervised monocular depth estimation, surpassing prior methods on NYU Depth-v2 and on the Garg split of KITTI. Our method delivers depth maps that yield plausible 3D reconstructions of the input scenes. Code is available at: https://github.com/SysCV/P3Depth"}

In this paper, we reveal and address the disadvantages of the conventional query-driven HOI detectors from the two aspects. For the association, previous two-branch methods suffer from complex and costly post-matching, while single-branch methods ignore the features distinction in different tasks. We propose Guided-Embedding Network (GEN) to attain a two-branch pipeline without post-matching. In GEN, we design an instance decoder to detect humans and objects with two independent query sets and a position Guided Embedding (p-GE) to mark the human and object in the same position as a pair. Besides, we design an interaction decoder to classify interactions, where the interaction queries are made of instance Guided Embeddings (i-GE) generated from the outputs of each instance decoder layer. For the interaction understanding, previous methods suffer from long-tailed distribution and zero-shot discovery. This paper proposes a Visual-Linguistic Knowledge Transfer (VLKT) training strategy to enhance interaction understanding by transferring knowledge from a visual-linguistic pre-trained model CLIP. In specific, we extract text embeddings for all labels with CLIP to initialize the classifier and adopt a mimic loss to minimize the visual feature distance between GEN and CLIP. As a result, GEN-VLKT outperforms the state of the art by large margins on multiple datasets, e.g., +5.05 mAP on HICO-Det. The source codes are available at https://github.com/YueLiao/gen-vlkt."}

More recently, convolution-free networks, based on multi-head self-attention (MSA) or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), become more and more popular. Nevertheless, it is not trivial when utilizing these newly-minted networks for video recognition due to the large variations and complexities in video data. In this paper, we present MLP-3D networks, a novel MLP-like 3D architecture for video recognition. Specifically, the architecture consists of MLP-3D blocks, where each block contains one MLP applied across tokens (i.e., token-mixing MLP) and one MLP applied independently to each token (i.e., channel MLP). By deriving the novel grouped time mixing (GTM) operations, we equip the basic token-mixing MLP with the ability of temporal modeling. GTM divides the input tokens into several temporal groups and linearly maps the tokens in each group with the shared projection matrix. Furthermore, we devise several variants of GTM with different grouping strategies, and compose each variant in different blocks of MLP-3D network by greedy architecture search. Without the dependence on convolutions or attention mechanisms, our MLP-3D networks achieves 68.5%/81.4% top-1 accuracy on Something-Something V2 and Kinetics-400 datasets, respectively. Despite with fewer computations, the results are comparable to state-of-the-art widely-used 3D CNNs and video transformers."}

In this paper, we question to argue that this setup by definition is not compatible with the inherent abstract and subjective nature of sketches -- the model might transfer well to new categories, but will not understand sketches existing in different test-time distribution as a result. We thus extend ZS-SBIR asking it to transfer to both categories and sketch distributions. Our key contribution is a test-time training paradigm that can adapt using just one sketch. Since there is no paired photo, we make use of a sketch raster-vector reconstruction module as a self-supervised auxiliary task. To maintain the fidelity of the trained cross-modal joint embedding during test-time update, we design a novel meta-learning based training paradigm to learn a separation between model updates incurred by this auxiliary task from those off the primary objective of discriminative learning. Extensive experiments show our model to outperform state-of-the-arts, thanks to the proposed test-time adaption that not only transfers to new categories but also accommodates to new sketching styles."}

Such methods do not scale to diverse sets of objects in the wild. We present a method that requires neither of them. It builds high-fidelity, articulated 3D models from many monocular casual videos in a differentiable rendering framework. Our key insight is to merge three schools of thought: (1) classic deformable shape models that make use of articulated bones and blend skinning, (2) canonical embeddings that establish correspondences between pixels and a canonical 3D model, and (3) volumetric neural radiance fields (NeRFs) that are amenable to gradient-based optimization. We introduce neural blend skinning models that allow for differentiable and invertible articulated deformations. When combined with canonical embeddings, such models allow us to establish dense correspondences across videos that can be self-supervised with cycle consistency. On real and synthetic datasets, our method shows higher-fidelity 3D reconstructions than prior works for humans and animals, with the ability to render realistic images from novel viewpoints."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2022", "Area": "CV", "Where": "CVPR", "Abbreviation": "StyTr2", "Title": "Image Style Transfer With Transformers", "Abstract": "The goal of image style transfer is to render an image with artistic features guided by a style reference while maintaining the original content. Owing to the locality in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), extracting and maintaining the global information of input images is difficult. Therefore, traditional neural style transfer methods face biased content representation. To address this critical issue, we take long-range dependencies of input images into account for image style transfer by proposing a transformer-based approach called StyTr^2. In contrast with visual transformers for other vision tasks, StyTr^2 contains two different transformer encoders to generate domain-specific sequences for content and style, respectively. Following the encoders, a multi-layer transformer decoder is adopted to stylize the content sequence according to the style sequence. We also analyze the deficiency of existing positional encoding methods and propose the content-aware positional encoding (CAPE), which is scale-invariant and more suitable for image style transfer tasks. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed StyTr^2 compared with state-of-the-art CNN-based and flow-based approaches.

Recent work mainly utilizes features in single or neighboring frames for constructing metric loss and empowering networks to extract representation of targets. Although this strategy is effective, it fails to fully exploit the information contained in a whole trajectory. To this end, we propose a strategy, namely multi-view trajectory contrastive learning, in which each trajectory is represented as a center vector. By maintaining all the vectors in a dynamically updated memory bank, a trajectory-level contrastive loss is devised to explore the inter-frame information in the whole trajectories. Besides, in this strategy, each target is represented as multiple adaptively selected keypoints rather than a pre-defined anchor or center. This design allows the network to generate richer representation from multiple views of the same target, which can better characterize occluded objects. Additionally, in the inference stage, a similarity-guided feature fusion strategy is developed for further boosting the quality of the trajectory representation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on MOTChallenge to verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The experimental results indicate that our method has surpassed preceding trackers and established new state-of-the-art performance."}

In order to enhance the supernet's evaluation ability, one greedy strategy is to sample good paths, and let the supernet lean towards the good ones and ease its evaluation burden as a result. However, in practice the search can be still quite inefficient since the identification of good paths is not accurate enough and sampled paths still scatter around the whole search space. In this paper, we leverage an explicit path filter to capture the characteristics of paths and directly filter those weak ones, so that the search can be thus implemented on the shrunk space more greedily and efficiently. Concretely, based on the fact that good paths are way much less than the weak ones in the space, we argue that the label of \"weak paths\" will be more confident and reliable than that of \"good paths\" in multi-path sampling. In this way, we thus cast the training of path filter in the positive and unlabeled (PU) learning paradigm, and also encourage a path embedding as better path/operation representation to enhance the identification capacity of the learned filter. By dint of this embedding, we can further shrink the search space by aggregating similar operations with similar embeddings, and the search can be more efficient and accurate. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method GreedyNASv2. For example, our obtained GreedyNASv2-L achieves 81.1% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset, significantly outperforming the ResNet-50 strong baselines."}

Knowledge distillation is thus introduced to assist the training of transformers. Unlike previous works, where merely heavy convolution-based teachers are provided, in this paper, we delve into the influence of models inductive biases in knowledge distillation (e.g., convolution and involution). Our key observation is that the teacher accuracy is not the dominant reason for the student accuracy, but the teacher inductive bias is more important. We demonstrate that lightweight teachers with different architectural inductive biases can be used to co-advise the student transformer with outstanding performances. The rationale behind is that models designed with different inductive biases tend to focus on diverse patterns, and teachers with different inductive biases attain various knowledge despite being trained on the same dataset. The diverse knowledge provides a more precise and comprehensive description of the data and compounds and boosts the performance of the student during distillation. Furthermore, we propose a token inductive bias alignment to align the inductive bias of the token with its target teacher model. With only lightweight teachers provided and using this cross inductive bias distillation method, our vision transformers (termed as CiT) outperform all previous vision transformers (ViT) of the same architecture on ImageNet. Moreover, our small size model CiT-SAK further achieves 82.7% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet without modifying the attention module of the ViT.

{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2022", "Area": "CV", "Where": "CVPR", "Abbreviation": "AdaMixer", "Title": "A Fast-Converging Query-Based Object Detector", "Abstract": "Traditional object detectors employ the dense paradigm of scanning over locations and scales in an image. The recent query-based object detectors break this convention by decoding image features with a set of learnable queries. However, this paradigm still suffers from slow convergence, limited performance, and design complexity of extra networks between backbone and decoder. In this paper, we find that the key to these issues is the adaptability of decoders for casting queries to varying objects. Accordingly, we propose a fast-converging query-based detector, named AdaMixer, by improving the adaptability of query-based decoding processes in two aspects. First, each query adaptively samples features over space and scales based on estimated offsets, which allows AdaMixer to efficiently attend to the coherent regions of objects. Then, we dynamically decode these sampled features with an adaptive MLP-Mixer under the guidance of each query. Thanks to these two critical designs, AdaMixer enjoys architectural simplicity without requiring dense attentional encoders or explicit pyramid networks. On the challenging MS COCO benchmark, AdaMixer with ResNet-50 as the backbone, with 12 training epochs, reaches up to 45.0 AP on the validation set along with 27.9 APs in detecting small objects. With the longer training scheme, AdaMixer with ResNeXt-101-DCN and Swin-S reaches 49.5 and 51.3 AP. Our work sheds light on a simple, accurate, and fast converging architecture for query-based object detectors. The code is made available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/AdaMixer."}

It is a straightforward but worth-studying extension given the recent success from BERT pretraining of image transformers. We introduce BEVT which decouples video representation learning into spatial representation learning and temporal dynamics learning. In particular, BEVT first performs masked image modeling on image data, and then conducts masked image modeling jointly with masked video modeling on video data. This design is motivated by two observations: 1) transformers learned on image datasets provide decent spatial priors that can ease the learning of video transformers, which are often times computationally-intensive if trained from scratch; 2) discriminative clues, i.e., spatial and temporal information, needed to make correct predictions vary among different videos due to large intra-class and inter-class variations. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging video benchmarks where BEVT achieves very promising results. On Kinetics 400, for which recognition mostly relies on discriminative spatial representations, BEVT achieves comparable results to strong supervised baselines. On Something-Something-V2 and Diving 48, which contain videos relying on temporal dynamics, BEVT outperforms by clear margins all alternative baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 71.4% and 87.2% Top-1 accuracy respectively.

Recently, hypernetwork-based approaches have been studied in the context of continuous and finetune-free iFSD with limited success. We take a closer look at important design choices of such methods, leading to several key improvements and resulting in a more accurate and flexible framework, which we call Sylph. In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of decoupling object classification from localization by leveraging a base detector that is pretrained for class-agnostic localization on large-scale dataset. Contrary to what previous results have suggested, we show that with a carefully designed class-conditional hypernetwork, finetune-free iFSD can be highly effective, especially when a large number of base categories with abundant data are available for meta-training, almost approaching alternatives that undergo test-time-training. This result is even more significant considering its many practical advantages: (1) incrementally learning new classes in sequence without additional training, (2) detecting both novel and seen classes in a single pass, and (3) no forgetting of previously seen classes. We benchmark our model on both COCO and LVIS, reporting as high as 17% AP on the long-tail rare classes on LVIS, indicating the promise of hypernetwork-based iFSD."}

While high dimensional hyperbolic embeddings lead to better representations, most hyperbolic models utilize low-dimensional embeddings, due to non-trivial optimization and visualization of high-dimensional hyperbolic data. We propose CO-SNE, which extends the Euclidean space visualization tool, t-SNE, to hyperbolic space. Like t-SNE, it converts distances between data points to joint probabilities and tries to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probabilities of high-dimensional data X and low-dimensional embedding Y. However, unlike Euclidean space, hyperbolic space is inhomogeneous: A volume could contain a lot more points at a location far from the origin. CO-SNE thus uses hyperbolic normal distributions for X and hyperbolic Cauchy instead of t-SNE's Student's t-distribution for Y , and it additionally seeks to preserve X's individual distances to the Origin in Y. We apply CO-SNE to naturally hyperbolic data and supervisedly learned hyperbolic features. Our results demonstrate that CO-SNE deflates high-dimensional hyperbolic data into a low-dimensional space without losing their hyperbolic characteristics, significantly outperforming popular visualization tools such as PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and HoroPCA which is also designed for hyperbolic data"}

Events are streamed data that are often dense when either the scene changes or the camera moves rapidly. The rapid movement causes the events to be overridden or missed when creating a tensor for the machine to learn on. To alleviate the event missing or overriding issue, we propose to learn to concentrate on the dense events to produce a compact event representation with high details for depth estimation. Specifically, we learn a model with events from both past and future but infer only with past data with the predicted future. We initially estimate depth in an event-only setting but also propose to further incorporate images and events by a hierarchical event and intensity combination network for better depth estimation.

However, with the increase of pre-training data amount, model architecture amount, and the private/inaccessible data, it is not very efficient or possible to pre-train all the model architectures on large-scale datasets. In this work, we investigate an alternative strategy for pre-training, namely Knowledge Distillation as Efficient Pre-training (KDEP), aiming to efficiently transfer the learned feature representation from existing pre-trained models to new student models for future downstream tasks. We observe that existing Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods are unsuitable towards pre-training since they normally distill the logits that are going to be discarded when transferred to downstream tasks. To resolve this problem, we propose a feature-based KD method with non-parametric feature dimension aligning.

We show that, unlike existing methods, one does not need multi-view data to achieve this goal.

We demonstrate this by training models to reconstruct object categories using datasets that contain only one view of each subject without depth or geometry information.

We jointly optimize (1) the pi-GAN objective to utilize its high-fidelity 3D-aware generation and (2) a carefully designed reconstruction objective. The latter includes an encoder coupled with pi-GAN generator to form an auto-encoder. Unlike previous few-shot NeRF approaches, our pipeline is unsupervised, capable of being trained with independent images without 3D, multi-view, or pose supervision. Applications of our pipeline include 3d avatar generation, object-centric novel view synthesis with a single input image, and 3d-aware super-resolution, to name a few."}

Our method incrementally initializes the rotation graph based on a hierarchy of triplet support. The key idea is to build a spanning tree by prioritizing the edges with many strong triplet supports and gradually adding those with weaker and fewer supports. This reduces the risk of adding outliers in the spanning tree. As a result, we obtain a robust initial solution that enables us to filter outliers prior to nonlinear optimization. With minimal modification, our approach can also integrate the knowledge of the number of valid 2D-2D correspondences. We perform extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results."}

But unlike GANs, DPMs use a set of latent variables that lack semantic meaning and cannot serve as a useful representation for other tasks. This paper explores the possibility of using DPMs for representation learning and seeks to extract a meaningful and decodable representation of an input image via autoencoding. Our key idea is to use a learnable encoder for discovering the high-level semantics, and a DPM as the decoder for modeling the remaining stochastic variations. Our method can encode any image into a two-part latent code, where the first part is semantically meaningful and linear, and the second part captures stochastic details, allowing near-exact reconstruction. This capability enables challenging applications that currently foil GAN-based methods, such as attribute manipulation on real images. We also show that this two-level encoding improves denoising efficiency and naturally facilitates various downstream tasks including few-shot conditional sampling."}

Directly applying methods for image or video stylization to 3D scenes cannot achieve such consistency. Thanks to recently proposed neural radiance fields (NeRF), we are able to represent a 3D scene in a consistent way. Consistent 3D scene stylization can be effectively achieved by stylizing the corresponding NeRF. However, there is a significant domain gap between style examples which are 2D images and NeRF which is an implicit volumetric representation. To address this problem, we propose a novel mutual learning framework for 3D scene stylization that combines a 2D image stylization network and NeRF to fuse the stylization ability of 2D stylization network with the 3D consistency of NeRF. We first pre-train a standard NeRF of the 3D scene to be stylized and replace its color prediction module with a style network to obtain a stylized NeRF. It is followed by distilling the prior knowledge of spatial consistency from NeRF to the 2D stylization network through an introduced consistency loss. We also introduce a mimic loss to supervise the mutual learning of the NeRF style module and fine-tune the 2D stylization decoder. In order to further make our model handle ambiguities of 2D stylization results, we introduce learnable latent codes that obey the probability distributions conditioned on the style. They are attached to training samples as conditional inputs to better learn the style module in our novel stylized NeRF. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is superior to existing approaches in both visual quality and long-range consistency."}

Yet, it has received little attention compared to its daytime counterpart. In this paper, we propose NightLab, a novel nighttime segmentation framework that leverages multiple deep learning models imbued with night-aware features to yield State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on multiple night segmentation benchmarks. Notably, NightLab contains models at two levels of granularity, i.e. image and regional, and each level is composed of light adaptation and segmentation modules. Given a nighttime image, the image level model provides an initial segmentation estimate while, in parallel, a hardness detection module identifies regions and their surrounding context that need further analysis. A regional level model focuses on these difficult regions to provide a significantly improved segmentation. All the models in NightLab are trained end-to-end using a set of proposed night-aware losses without handcrafted heuristics. Extensive experiments on the NightCity and BDD100K datasets show NightLab achieves SoTA performance compared to concurrent methods.

Although several studies have focused on encoding a skeleton, less attention has been paid to embed this information into the latent representations of human action. InfoGCN proposes a learning framework for action recognition combining a novel learning objective and an encoding method. First, we design an information bottleneck-based learning objective to guide the model to learn informative but compact latent representations. To provide discriminative information for classifying action, we introduce attention-based graph convolution that captures the context-dependent intrinsic topology of human action. In addition, we present a multi-modal representation of the skeleton using the relative position of joints, designed to provide complementary spatial information for joints. InfoGCN surpasses the known state-of-the-art on multiple skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks with the accuracy of 93.0% on NTU RGB+D 60 cross-subject split, 89.8% on NTU RGB+D 120 cross-subject split, and 97.0% on NW-UCLA."}

However, it is difficult for pre-defined anchors to cover good crops globally, and the regression methods ignore the cropping diversity. In this paper, we regard image cropping as a set prediction problem. A set of crops regressed from multiple learnable anchors is matched with the labeled good crops, and a classifier is trained using the matching results to select a valid subset from all the predictions. This new perspective equips our model with globality and diversity, mitigating the shortcomings but inherit the strengthens of previous methods. Despite the advantages, the set prediction method causes inconsistency between the validity labels and the crops. To deal with this problem, we propose to smooth the validity labels with two different methods. The first method that uses crop qualities as direct guidance is designed for the datasets with nearly dense quality labels. The second method based on the self distillation can be used in sparsely labeled datasets. Experimental results on the public datasets show the merits of our approach over state-of-the-art counterparts."}

Existing WSSS methods commonly argue that the sparse coverage of CAM incurs the performance bottleneck of WSSS. This paper provides analytical and empirical evidence that the actual bottleneck may not be sparse coverage but a global thresholding scheme applied after CAM. Then, we show that this issue can be mitigated by satisfying two conditions; 1) reducing the imbalance in the foreground activation and 2) increasing the gap between the foreground and the background activation. Based on these findings, we propose a novel activation manipulation network with a per-pixel classification loss and a label conditioning module. Per-pixel classification naturally induces two-level activation in activation maps, which can penalize the most discriminative parts, promote the less discriminative parts, and deactivate the background regions. Label conditioning imposes that the output label of pseudo-masks should be any of true image-level labels; it penalizes the wrong activation assigned to non-target classes. Based on extensive analysis and evaluations, we demonstrate that each component helps produce accurate pseudo-masks, achieving the robustness against the choice of the global threshold.

The existing approaches work well when local clients have independent and identically distributed (IID) data but fail to generalize to a more practical FSSL setting, i.e., Non-IID setting. In this paper, we present a Random Sampling Consensus Federated learning, namely RSCFed, by considering the uneven reliability among models from labeled clients and unlabeled clients. Our key motivation is that given models with large deviations from either labeled clients or unlabeled clients, the consensus could be reached by performing random sup-sampling over clients. To achieve it, instead of directly aggregating local models, we first distill several sub-consensus models by random sub-sampling over clients and then aggregating the sub-consensus models to the global model. To enhance the robustness of sub-consensus models, we also develop a novel distance-reweighted model aggregation method. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarked datasets, including both natural images and medical images."}

To facilitate a better adaptation of the FMT, we leverage an Adaptive Receptive Field (ARF) module to ensure a smooth transit in scopes of features and bridge different stages with a feature pathway to pass transformed features and gradients across different scales. In addition, we apply pair-wise feature correlation to measure similarity between features, and adopt ambiguity-reducing focal loss to strengthen the supervision. To the best of our knowledge, TransMVSNet is the first attempt to leverage Transformer into the task of MVS.

Core to our approach is our differentiable alignment optimization based on dense 2D-3D object correspondences and Procrustes alignment.

We make two contributions by extending the common Mask-RCNN framework in its second stage -- namely, we specify a new object class classifier based on the probit function and a new uncertainty-guided bounding-box predictor. The former leverages Bayesian learning to address a paucity of training examples of new classes. The latter learns not only to predict object bounding boxes but also to estimate the uncertainty of the prediction as a guidance for bounding box refinement. We also specify two new loss functions in terms of the estimated object-class distribution and bounding-box uncertainty. Our contributions produce significant performance gains on the COCO dataset over the state of the art -- specifically, the gain of +6 on the new classes and +16 on the old classes in the AP instance segmentation metric. Furthermore, we are the first to evaluate the incremental few-shot setting on the more challenging LVIS dataset."}

One may use differentially private generative models to generate synthetic data. Unfortunately, generators are typically restricted to generating images of low-resolutions due to the limitation of noisy gradients. Here, we propose DPGEN, a network model designed to synthesize high-resolution natural images while satisfying differential privacy. In particular, we propose an energy-guided network trained on sanitized data to indicate the direction of the true data distribution via Langevin Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method. In contrast to the state-of-the-art methods that can process only low-resolution images (e.g., MNIST and Fashion-MNIST), DPGEN can generate differentially private synthetic images with resolutions up to 128*128 with superior visual quality and data utility.

FSCIL aims to incrementally learn new classes with only a few samples in each class. Most existing methods only consider the incremental steps at test time. The learning objective of these methods is often hand-engineered and is not directly tied to the objective (i.e. incrementally learning new classes) during testing. Those methods are sub-optimal due to the misalignment between the training objectives and what the methods are expected to do during evaluation. In this work, we proposed a bi-level optimization based on meta-learning to directly optimize the network to learn how to incrementally learn in the setting of FSCIL. Concretely, we propose to sample sequences of incremental tasks from base classes for training to simulate the evaluation protocol. For each task, the model is learned using a meta-objective such that it is capable to perform fast adaptation without forgetting. Furthermore, we propose a bi-directional guided modulation, which is learned to automatically modulate the activations to reduce catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline and achieves the state-of-the-art results on CIFAR100, MiniImageNet, and CUB200 datasets."}

However, existing eye-based frameworks a) perform authentication and Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) independently and b) involve significant pre-processing steps to extract the iris region. Here, we introduce a joint framework for EA and PAD using periocular images. While a deep Multitask Learning (MTL) network can perform both the tasks, MTL suffers from the forgetting effect since the training datasets for EA and PAD are disjoint. To overcome this, we propose Eye Authentication with PAD (EyePAD), a distillation-based method that trains a single network for EA and PAD while reducing the effect of forgetting. To further improve the EA performance, we introduce a novel approach called EyePAD++ that includes training an MTL network on both EA and PAD data, while distilling the 'versatility' of the EyePAD network through an additional distillation step. Our proposed methods outperform the SOTA in PAD and obtain near-SOTA performance in eye-to-eye verification, without any pre-processing. We also demonstrate the efficacy of EyePAD and EyePAD++ in user-to-user verification with PAD across network backbones and image quality."}

There is a growing interest in the integration of user queries into video summarization or query-driven video summarization. This video summarization method predicts a concise synopsis of the original video based on the user query, which is commonly represented by the input text. However, two inherent problems exist in this query-driven way. First, the text query might not be enough to describe the exact and diverse needs of the user. Second, the user cannot edit once the summaries are produced, while we assume the needs of the user should be subtle and need to be adjusted interactively. To solve these two problems, we propose IntentVizor, an interactive video summarization framework guided by generic multi-modality queries. The input query that describes the user's needs are not limited to text but also the video snippets. We further represent these multi-modality finer-grained queries as user 'intent', which is interpretable, interactable, editable, and can better quantify the user's needs. In this paper, we use a set of the proposed intents to represent the user query and design a new interactive visual analytic interface. Users can interactively control and adjust these mixed-initiative intents to obtain a more satisfying summary through the interface. Also, to improve the summarization quality via video understanding, a novel Granularity-Scalable Ego-Graph Convolutional Networks (GSE-GCN) is proposed. We conduct our experiments on two benchmark datasets. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

In this paper, we consider the problem of audio-guided video semantic segmentation from the viewpoint of end-to-end denoised encoder-decoder network learning. We propose the walvelet-based encoder network to learn the crossmodal representations of the video contents with audio-form queries. Specifically, we adopt a multi-head cross-modal attention to explore the potential relations of video and query contents. A 2-dimension discrete wavelet transform is employed to decompose the audio-video features. We quantify the thresholds of high frequency coefficients to filter the noise and outliers. Then, a self attention-free decoder network is developed to generate the target masks with frequency domain transforms. Moreover, we maximize mutual information between the encoded features and multi-modal features after cross-modal attention to enhance the audio guidance. In addition, we construct the first large-scale audio-guided video semantic segmentation dataset. The extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method."}

Previous work focuses on reconstructing pre-defined 3D representations, e.g. textured meshes, or implicit representations, e.g. radiance fields, and often requires input images with precise camera poses and long processing times for each novel scene. In this work, we propose the Scene Representation Transformer (SRT), a method which processes posed or unposed RGB images of a new area, infers a \"set-latent scene representation\", and synthesises novel views, all in a single feed-forward pass. To calculate the scene representation, we propose a generalization of the Vision Transformer to sets of images, enabling global information integration, and hence 3D reasoning. An efficient decoder transformer parameterizes the light field by attending into the scene representation to render novel views. Learning is supervised end-to-end by minimizing a novel-view reconstruction error. We show that this method outperforms recent baselines in terms of PSNR and speed on synthetic datasets, including a new dataset created for the paper.

Most previous methods adopt Projected Gradient Decent (PGD) with manually specifying attack parameters for AE generation.

Several works have revealed that using a fixed attack strategy to generate AEs during the whole training phase limits the model robustness and propose to exploit different attack strategies at different training stages to improve robustness. But those multi-stage hand-crafted attack strategies need much domain expertise, and the robustness improvement is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial training by introducing the concept of \"learnable attack strategy\", dubbed LAS-AT, which learns to automatically produce attack strategies to improve the model robustness. Our framework is composed of a target network that uses AEs for training to improve robustness, and a strategy network that produces attack strategies to control the AE generation.

With the general-purpose Transformer architecture replacing the hard-coded inductive biases of convolution, ViTs have surpassed CNNs, especially in data-sufficient circumstances. However, ViTs are prone to over-fit on small datasets and thus rely on large-scale pre-training, which expends enormous time. In this paper, we strive to liberate ViTs from pre-training by introducing CNNs' inductive biases back to ViTs while preserving their network architectures for higher upper bound and setting up more suitable optimization objectives. To begin with, an agent CNN is designed based on the given ViT with inductive biases. Then a bootstrapping training algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the agent and ViT with weight sharing, during which the ViT learns inductive biases from the intermediate features of the agent. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-1k with limited training data have shown encouraging results that the inductive biases help ViTs converge significantly faster and outperform conventional CNNs with even fewer parameters.

ELSR exploits scene planes that are commonly seen in city scenes and sparse 3D points that can be acquired easily from the structure-from-motion (SfM) approach. For two views, ELSR efficiently finds the local scene plane to guide the line matching and exploits sparse 3D points to accelerate and constrain the matching. To reconstruct a 3D line segment with multiple views, ELSR utilizes an efficient abstraction approach that selects representative 3D lines based on their spatial consistence. Our experiments demonstrated that ELSR had a higher accuracy and efficiency than the existing methods. Moreover, our results showed that ELSR could reconstruct 3D lines efficiently for large and complex scenes that contain thousands of large-size images."}

However, compared with the methods assuming fixed form label distribution, ALDL methods have not achieved better performance. We argue that existing ALDL algorithms do not fully exploit the intrinsic properties of ordinal regression. In this paper, we emphatically summarize that learning an adaptive label distribution on ordinal regression tasks should follow three principles. First, the probability corresponding to the ground-truth should be the highest in label distribution. Second, the probabilities of neighboring labels should decrease with the increase of distance away from the ground-truth, i.e., the distribution is unimodal. Third, the label distribution should vary with samples changing, and even be distinct for different instances with the same label, due to the different levels of difficulty and ambiguity. Under the premise of these principles, we propose a novel loss function for fully adaptive label distribution learning, namely unimodal-concentrated loss. Specifically, the unimodal loss derived from the learning to rank strategy constrains the distribution to be unimodal. Furthermore, the estimation error and the variance of the predicted distribution for a specific sample are integrated into the proposed concentrated loss to make the predicted distribution maximize at the ground-truth and vary according to the predicting uncertainty. Extensive experimental results on typical ordinal regression tasks including age and head pose estimation, show the superiority of our proposed unimodal-concentrated loss compared with existing loss functions."}

Furthermore, its application to inverse problems have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. Unfortunately, diffusion models have a critical downside - they are inherently slow to sample from, needing few thousand steps of iteration to generate images from pure Gaussian noise. In this work, we show that starting from Gaussian noise is unnecessary. Instead, starting from a single forward diffusion with better initialization significantly reduces the number of sampling steps in the reverse conditional diffusion. This phenomenon is formally explained by the contraction theory of the stochastic difference equations like our conditional diffusion strategy - the alternating applications of reverse diffusion followed by a non-expansive data consistency step. The new sampling strategy, dubbed Come-Closer-Diffuse-Faster (CCDF), also reveals a new insight on how the existing feed-forward neural network approaches for inverse problems can be synergistically combined with the diffusion models. Experimental results with super-resolution, image inpainting, and compressed sensing MRI demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction performance at significantly reduced sampling steps."}

We propose a new face-swapping model called 'Smooth-Swap', which excludes complex handcrafted designs and allows fast and stable training. The main idea of Smooth-Swap is to build smooth identity embedding that can provide stable gradients for identity change. Unlike the one used in previous models trained for a purely discriminative task, the proposed embedding is trained with a supervised contrastive loss promoting a smoother space. With improved smoothness, Smooth-Swap suffices to be composed of a generic U-Net-based generator and three basic loss functions, a far simpler design compared with the previous models. Extensive experiments on face-swapping benchmarks (FFHQ, FaceForensics++) and face images in the wild show that our model is also quantitatively and qualitatively comparable or even superior to the existing methods."}

Existing methods in this direction suppose that a domain can be characterized by styles of its images, and train a network using style-augmented data so that the network is not biased to particular style distributions. However, these methods are restricted to a finite set of styles since they obtain styles for augmentation from a fixed set of external images or by interpolating those of training data. To address this limitation and maximize the benefit of style augmentation, we propose a new method that synthesizes novel styles constantly during training. Our method manages multiple queues to store styles that have been observed so far, and synthesizes novel styles whose distribution is distinct from the distribution of styles in the queues. The style synthesis process is formulated as a monotone submodular optimization, thus can be conducted efficiently by a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of achieving state-of-the-art domain generalization performance."}

Most existing VLN agents learn the instruction-path data directly and cannot sufficiently explore action-level alignment knowledge inside the multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose modAlity-aligneD Action PrompTs (ADAPT), which provides the VLN agent with action prompts to enable the explicit learning of action-level modality alignment to pursue successful navigation. Specifically, an action prompt is defined as a modality-aligned pair of an image sub-prompt and a text sub-prompt, where the former is a single-view observation and the latter is a phrase like \"walk past the chair\". When starting navigation, the instruction-related action prompt set is retrieved from a pre-built action prompt base and passed through a prompt encoder to obtain the prompt feature. Then the prompt feature is concatenated with the original instruction feature and fed to a multi-layer transformer for action prediction. To collect high-quality action prompts into the prompt base, we use the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model which has powerful cross-modality alignment ability. A modality alignment loss and a sequential consistency loss are further introduced to enhance the alignment of the action prompt and enforce the agent to focus on the related prompt sequentially. Experimental results on both R2R and RxR show the superiority of ADAPT over state-of-the-art methods."}

We show in experiments that the Rotation-equivariance-supervised Inertial Odometry (RIO) trained with 30% data achieves on par performance with a model trained with the whole database. Adaptive TTT improves models performance in all cases and makes more than 25% improvements under several scenarios."}

Previous methods usually adopt a hand-crafted rule to generate pseudo labels from multi-view estimations in order to supervise the network training in each view. However, these methods ignore the rich semantic information in each view and ignore the complex dependencies between different regions of different views. To solve these problems, we propose a cross-view fusion network to fully exploit and adaptively aggregate multi-view information. We encode diverse semantic information in each view into multiple compact nodes. Then, we introduce the graph convolution to model the complex dependencies between nodes and perform cross-view information interaction. Based on the cross-view fusion network, we propose a strong self-supervised framework for 3D hand pose and hand mesh estimation. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo multi-view training strategy to extend our framework to a more general scenario in which only single-view training data is used. Results on NYU dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous self-supervised methods by 17.5% and 30.3% in multi-view and single-view scenarios. Meanwhile, our framework achieves comparable results to several strongly supervised methods."}

Current researches mainly focus on only English characters and digits, while few work studies Chinese characters due to the lack of public large-scale and high-quality Chinese datasets, which limits the practical application scenarios of text segmentation. Different from English which has a limited alphabet of letters, Chinese has much more basic characters with complex structures, making the problem more difficult to deal with. To better analyze this problem, we propose the Bi-lingual Text Segmentation (BTS) dataset, a benchmark that covers various common Chinese scenes including 14,250 diverse and fine-annotated text images. BTS mainly focuses on Chinese characters, and also contains English words and digits. We also introduce Prior Guided Text Segmentation Network (PGTSNet), the first baseline to handle bi-lingual and complex-structured text segmentation. A plug-in text region highlighting module and a text perceptual discriminator are proposed in PGTSNet to supervise the model with text prior, and guide for more stable and finer text segmentation. A variation loss is also employed for suppressing background noise under complex scene. Extensive experiments are conducted not only to demonstrate the necessity and superiority of the proposed dataset BTS, but also to show the effectiveness of the proposed PGTSNet compared with a variety of state-of-the-art text segmentation methods."}

We argue that it is more desirable to simplify such two-stage paradigm to a single-stage one to promote both efficiency and performance. To this end, we present an efficient single-stage solution, Decoupled Regression Model (DRM), with three distinct novelties. First, DRM introduces a new decoupled representation for 3D pose, which expresses the 2D pose in image plane and depth information of each 3D human instance via 2D center point (center of visible keypoints) and root point (denoted as pelvis), respectively. Second, to learn better feature representation for the human depth regression, DRM introduces a 2D Pose-guided Depth Query Module (PDQM) to extract the features in 2D pose regression branch, enabling the depth regression branch to perceive the scale information of instances. Third, DRM leverages a Decoupled Absolute Pose Loss (DAPL) to facilitate the absolute root depth and root-relative depth estimation, thus improving the accuracy of absolute 3D pose. Comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks including MuPoTS-3D and Panoptic clearly verify the superiority of our framework, which outperforms the state-of-the-art bottom-up absolute 3D pose estimation methods."}

Towards this goal, we investigate cross-modal text-to-point-cloud localization that will allow us to specify, for example, a vehicle pick-up or goods delivery location. In particular, we propose Text2Pos, a cross-modal localization module that learns to align textual descriptions with localization cues in a coarse- to-fine manner. Given a point cloud of the environment, Text2Pos locates a position that is specified via a natural language-based description of the immediate surroundings. To train Text2Pos and study its performance, we construct KITTI360Pose, the first dataset for this task based on the recently introduced KITTI360 dataset. Our experiments show that we can localize 65% of textual queries within 15m distance to query locations for top-10 retrieved locations.

Although Transformer-based models have gained significant improved captioning performance, their computational cost is very high. A feasible way to reduce the time complexity is to exit the prediction early in internal decoding layers without passing the entire model. However, it is not straightforward to devise early exiting into image captioning due to the following issues. On one hand, the representation in shallow layers lacks high-level semantic and sufficient cross-modal fusion information for accurate prediction. On the other hand, the exiting decisions made by internal classifiers are unreliable sometimes. To solve these issues, we propose DeeCap framework for efficient image captioning, which dynamically selects proper-sized decoding layers from a global perspective to exit early. The key to successful early exiting lies in the specially designed imitation learning mechanism, which predicts the deep layer activation with shallow layer features. By deliberately merging the imitation learning into the whole image captioning architecture, the imitated deep layer representation can mitigate the loss brought by the missing of actual deep layers when early exiting is undertaken, resulting in significant reduction in calculation cost with small sacrifice of accuracy. Experiments on the MS COCO and Flickr30k datasets demonstrate the DeeCap can achieve competitive performances with 4 speed-up. Code is available at: https://github.com/feizc/DeeCap."}

In this paper, we propose a methodology, Locality Injection, to incorporate local priors into an FC layer via merging the trained parameters of a parallel conv kernel into the FC kernel. Locality Injection can be viewed as a novel Structural Re-parameterization method since it equivalently converts the structures via transforming the parameters. Based on that, we propose a multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) block named RepMLP Block, which uses three FC layers to extract features, and a novel architecture named RepMLPNet. The hierarchical design distinguishes RepMLPNet from the other concurrently proposed vision MLPs. As it produces feature maps of different levels, it qualifies as a backbone model for downstream tasks like semantic segmentation. Our results reveal that 1) Locality Injection is a general methodology for MLP models; 2) RepMLPNet has favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared to the other MLPs; 3) RepMLPNet is the first MLP that seamlessly transfer to Cityscapes semantic segmentation.

Instead of relying on the Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) techniques, we propose to solve the problem by decomposing all pedestrians into the initial pedestrians who existed in the first frame and the new pedestrians with separate identities in each following frame. Then, an end-to-end Decomposition and Reasoning Network (DRNet) is designed to predict the initial pedestrian count with the density estimation method and reason the new pedestrian's count of each frame with the differentiable optimal transport.

The clustering is computed with an alternating procedure, by first assigning pixels to the clusters by their feature affinity, and then updating the cluster centers and pixel features. Together, these operations comprise the Clustering Mask Transformer (CMT) layer, which produces cross-attention that is denser and more consistent with the final segmentation task.

Recent advances can achieve impressive results with the help of GAN prior. They either design complicated modules to modify the fixed GAN prior or adopt complex training strategies to finetune the generator. In this work, we propose a generative and controllable face SR framework, called GCFSR, which can reconstruct images with faithful identity information without any additional priors. Generally, GCFSR has an encoder-generator architecture. Two modules called style modulation and feature modulation are designed for the multi-factor SR task. The style modulation aims to generate realistic face details and the feature modulation dynamically fuses the multi-level encoded features and the generated ones conditioned on the upscaling factor. The simple and elegant architecture can be trained from scratch in an end-to-end manner. For small upscaling factors (\\leq8), GCFSR can produce surprisingly good results with only adversarial loss. After adding L1 and perceptual losses, GCFSR can outperform state-of-the-art methods for large upscaling factors (16, 32, 64). During the test phase, we can modulate the generative strength via feature modulation by changing the conditional upscaling factor continuously to achieve various generative effects.

However, conventional pruning methods have limitations in that: they are restricted to pruning process only, and they require a fully pre-trained large model. Such limitations may lead to sub-optimal model quality as well as excessive memory and training cost. In this paper, we propose a novel Channel Exploration methodology, dubbed as CHEX, to rectify these problems. As opposed to pruning-only strategy, we propose to repeatedly prune and regrow the channels throughout the training process, which reduces the risk of pruning important channels prematurely. More exactly: From intra-layer's aspect, we tackle the channel pruning problem via a well-known column subset selection (CSS) formulation. From inter-layer's aspect, our regrowing stages open a path for dynamically re-allocating the number of channels across all the layers under a global channel sparsity constraint. In addition, all the exploration process is done in a single training from scratch without the need of a pre-trained large model. Experimental results demonstrate that CHEX can effectively reduce the FLOPs of diverse CNN architectures on a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and 3D vision. For example, our compressed ResNet-50 model on ImageNet dataset achieves 76% top-1 accuracy with only 25% FLOPs of the original ResNet-50 model, outperforming previous state-of-the-art channel pruning methods.

With end-to-end deep learning systems, grouping of image regions usually happens implicitly via top-down supervision from pixel-level recognition labels. Instead, in this paper, we propose to bring back the grouping mechanism into deep networks, which allows semantic segments to emerge automatically with only text supervision. We propose a hierarchical Grouping Vision Transformer (GroupViT), which goes beyond the regular grid structure representation and learns to group image regions into progressively larger arbitrary-shaped segments. We train GroupViT jointly with a text encoder on a large-scale image-text dataset via contrastive losses. With only text supervision and without any pixel-level annotations, GroupViT learns to group together semantic regions and successfully transfers to the task of semantic segmentation in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without any further fine-tuning. It achieves a zero-shot accuracy of 52.3% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and 22.4% mIoU on PASCAL Context datasets, and performs competitively to state-of-the-art transfer-learning methods requiring greater levels of supervision.

Attribute prediction has seen exciting recent progress and is often formulated as a multi-label classification problem. Yet significant challenges remain in: 1) predicting a large number of attributes over multiple object categories, 2) modeling category-dependence of attributes, 3) methodically capturing both global and local scene context, and 4) robustly predicting attributes of objects with low pixel-count. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-category attribute prediction deep architecture named GlideNet, which contains three distinct feature extractors. A global feature extractor recognizes what objects are present in a scene, whereas a local one focuses on the area surrounding the object of interest. Meanwhile, an intrinsic feature extractor uses an extension of standard convolution dubbed Informed Convolution to retrieve features of objects with low pixel-count utilizing its binary mask. GlideNet then uses gating mechanisms with binary masks and its self-learned category embedding to combine the dense embeddings. Collectively, the Global-Local-Intrinsic blocks comprehend the scene's global context while attending to the characteristics of the local object of interest. The architecture adapts the feature composition based on the category via category embedding. Finally, using the combined features, an interpreter predicts the attributes, and the length of the output is determined by the category, thereby removing unnecessary attributes. GlideNet can achieve compelling results on two recent and challenging datasets -- VAW and CAR -- for large-scale attribute prediction. For instance, it obtains more than 5% gain over state of the art in the mean recall (mR) metric. GlideNet's advantages are especially apparent when predicting attributes of objects with low pixel counts as well as attributes that demand global context understanding. Finally, we show that GlideNet excels in training starved real-world scenarios."}

Many methods tackle this problem by storing previous samples, while in some applications, training data from previous tasks cannot be legally stored. In this work, we propose to employ mode connectivity in loss landscapes to achieve better plasticity-stability trade-off without any previous samples. We give an analysis of why and how to connect two independently optimized optima of networks, null-space projection for previous tasks and simple SGD for the current task, can attain a meaningful balance between preserving already learned knowledge and granting sufficient flexibility for learning a new task. This analysis of mode connectivity also provides us a new perspective and technology to control the trade-off between plasticity and stability. We evaluate the proposed method on several benchmark datasets. The results indicate our simple method can achieve notable improvement, and perform well on both the past and current tasks. On 10-split-CIFAR-100 task, our method achieves 79.79% accuracy, which is 6.02% higher. Our method also achieves 6.33% higher accuracy on TinyImageNet.

Adversarial patch attacks, which are easy to implement in the physical world, pose a serious threat to state-of-the-art object detectors. Developing reliable defenses for object detectors against patch attacks is critical but severely understudied. In this paper, we propose Segment and Complete defense (SAC), a general framework for defending object detectors against patch attacks through detection and removal of adversarial patches. We first train a patch segmenter that outputs patch masks which provide pixel-level localization of adversarial patches. We then propose a self adversarial training algorithm to robustify the patch segmenter. In addition, we design a robust shape completion algorithm, which is guaranteed to remove the entire patch from the images if the outputs of the patch segmenter are within a certain Hamming distance of the ground-truth patch masks. Our experiments on COCO and xView datasets demonstrate that SAC achieves superior robustness even under strong adaptive attacks with no reduction in performance on clean images, and generalizes well to unseen patch shapes, attack budgets, and unseen attack methods. Furthermore, we present the APRICOT-Mask dataset, which augments the APRICOT dataset with pixel-level annotations of adversarial patches. We show SAC can significantly reduce the targeted attack success rate of physical patch attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/joellliu/SegmentAndComplete."}

Although these models proved to be effective in many vision tasks such as image recognition, there remain challenges in adapting them for low-level vision. The inflexibility to support high-resolution images and limitations of local attention are perhaps the main bottlenecks. In this work, we present a multi-axis MLP based architecture called MAXIM, that can serve as an efficient and flexible general-purpose vision backbone for image processing tasks. MAXIM uses a UNet-shaped hierarchical structure and supports long-range interactions enabled by spatially-gated MLPs. Specifically, MAXIM contains two MLP-based building blocks: a multi-axis gated MLP that allows for efficient and scalable spatial mixing of local and global visual cues, and a cross-gating block, an alternative to cross-attention, which accounts for cross-feature conditioning. Both these modules are exclusively based on MLPs, but also benefit from being both global and 'fully-convolutional', two properties that are desirable for image processing. Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed MAXIM model achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than ten benchmarks across a range of image processing tasks, including denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and enhancement while requiring fewer or comparable numbers of parameters and FLOPs than competitive models.

The discriminative re-id decoder utilizes a multi-level supervision scheme with a shared decoder for discriminative re-id feature learning and also comprises a part attention block to encode relationship between different parts of a person.

Currently, there is a limited understanding of what information is captured by these models in their intermediate representations. For example, while it has been observed that action recognition algorithms are heavily influenced by visual appearance in single static frames, there is no quantitative methodology for evaluating such static bias in the latent representation compared to bias toward dynamic information (e.g., motion). We tackle this challenge by proposing a novel approach for quantifying the static and dynamic biases of any spatiotemporal model. To show the efficacy of our approach, we analyse two widely studied tasks, action recognition and video object segmentation. Our key findings are threefold: (i) Most examined spatiotemporal models are biased toward static information; although, certain two-stream architectures with cross-connections show a better balance between the static and dynamic information captured. (ii) Some datasets that are commonly assumed to be biased toward dynamics are actually biased toward static information. (iii) Individual units (channels) in an architecture can be biased toward static, dynamic or a combination of the two."}

Most research considers learning representations from single images, ignoring any potential interactions between them. However, due to the high intra-identity variations, ignoring such interactions typically leads to outlier features. To tackle this issue, we propose a Neighbor Transformer Network, or NFormer, which explicitly models interactions across all input images, thus suppressing outlier features and leading to more robust representations overall. As modelling interactions between enormous amount of images is a massive task with lots of dis- tractors, NFormer introduces two novel modules, the Landmark Agent Attention, and the Reciprocal Neighbor Softmax. Specifically, the Landmark Agent Attention efficiently models the relation map between images by a low-rank factorization with a few landmarks in feature space. Moreover, the Reciprocal Neighbor Softmax achieves sparse attention to relevant -rather than all- neighbors only, which alleviates interference of irrelevant representations and further relieves the computational burden. In experiments on four large-scale datasets, NFormer achieves a new state-of-the-art. The code is released at https://github.com/haochenheheda/NFormer."}

For this purpose, we encode the image and text conditions in a shared embedding space and propose a unified hair editing framework by leveraging the powerful image text representation capability of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model. With the carefully designed network structures and loss functions, our framework can perform high-quality hair editing in a disentangled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of manipulation accuracy, visual realism of editing results, and irrelevant attribute preservation."}

Even though these two knowledge bases are crucial, we find that current databases lack a comprehensive awareness of them. In this work, we propose a multi-modal and rich-annotated knowledge repository, OakInk, for visual and cognitive understanding of hand-object interactions. We start to collect 1,800 common household objects and annotate their affordances to construct the first knowledge base: Oak. Given the affordance, we record rich human interactions with 100 selected objects in Oak. Finally, we transfer the interactions on the 100 recorded objects to their virtual counterparts through a novel method: Tink. The recorded and transferred hand-object interactions constitute the second knowledge base: Ink. As a result, OakInk contains 50,000 distinct affordance-aware and intent-oriented hand-object interactions. We benchmark OakInk on pose estimation and grasp generation tasks. Moreover, we propose two practical applications of OakInk: intent-based interaction generation and handover generation. Our dataset and source code are publicly available at www.oakink.net."}

These feature extractors usually operate on video frames sampled at a fixed frame rate and are often trained on image/video understanding tasks, without adaption to video captioning data. In this work, we present SwinBERT, an end-to-end transformer-based model for video captioning, which takes video frame patches directly as inputs, and outputs a natural language description. Instead of leveraging multiple 2D/3D feature extractors, our method adopts a video transformer to encode spatial-temporal representations that can adapt to variable lengths of video input without dedicated design for different frame rates. Based on this model architecture, we show that video captioning can benefit significantly from more densely sampled video frames as opposed to previous successes with sparsely sampled video frames for video-and-language understanding tasks (e.g., video question answering). Moreover, to avoid the inherent redundancy in consecutive video frames, we propose adaptively learning a sparse attention mask and optimizing it for task-specific performance improvement through better long-range video sequence modeling. Through extensive experiments on 5 video captioning datasets, we show that SwinBERT achieves across-the-board performance improvements over previous methods, often by a large margin. The learned sparse attention masks in addition push the limit to new state of the arts, and can be transferred between different video lengths and between different datasets.

The proposed approach minimizes potential reconstruction inconsistency that happens due to insufficient viewpoints by imposing the entropy constraint of the density in each ray. In addition, to alleviate the potential degenerate issue when all training images are acquired from almost redundant viewpoints, we further incorporate the spatially smoothness constraint into the estimated images by restricting information gains from a pair of rays with slightly different viewpoints. The main idea of our algorithm is to make reconstructed scenes compact along individual rays and consistent across rays in the neighborhood. The proposed regularizers can be plugged into most of existing neural volume rendering techniques based on NeRF in a straightforward way. Despite its simplicity, we achieve consistently improved performance compared to existing neural view synthesis methods by large margins on multiple standard benchmarks."}

Compared with ordinary semi-supervised learning, this task is much more challenging due to the absence of any known negative labels. While existing cost-sensitive-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performances, they explicitly minimize the risk of classifying unlabeled data as negative samples, which might result in a negative-prediction preference of the classifier. To alleviate this issue, we resort to a label distribution perspective for PU learning in this paper. Noticing that the label distribution of unlabeled data is fixed when the class prior is known, it can be naturally used as supervision for the model. Motivated by this, we propose to pursue the label distribution consistency between predicted and ground-truth label distributions, which is formulated by aligning their expectations. Moreover, we further adopt the entropy minimization and Mixup regularization to avoid the trivial solution of the label distribution consistency on unlabeled data and mitigate the consequent confirmation bias. Experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

Firstly, we propose a second order spatial compatibility (SC^2) measure to compute the similarity between correspondences. It considers the global compatibility instead of local consistency, allowing for more distinctive clustering between inliers and outliers at early stage. Based on this measure, our registration pipeline employs a global spectral technique to find some reliable seeds from the initial correspondences. Then we design a two-stage strategy to expand each seed to a consensus set based on the SC^2 measure matrix. Finally, we feed each consensus set to a weighted SVD algorithm to generate a candidate rigid transformation and select the best model as the final result. Our method can guarantee to find a certain number of outlier-free consensus sets using fewer samplings, making the model estimation more efficient and robust. In addition, the proposed SC^2 measure is general and can be easily plugged into deep learning based frameworks. Extensive experiments are carried out to investigate the performance of our method."}

Most methods generate vision tokens by splitting an image into a regular and fixed grid and treating each cell as a token. However, not all regions are equally important in human-centric vision tasks, e.g., the human body needs a fine representation with many tokens, while the image background can be modeled by a few tokens. To address this problem, we propose a novel Vision Transformer, called Token Clustering Transformer (TCFormer), which merges tokens by progressive clustering, where the tokens can be merged from different locations with flexible shapes and sizes. The tokens in TCFormer can not only focus on important areas but also adjust the token shapes to fit the semantic concept and adopt a fine resolution for regions containing critical details, which is beneficial to capturing detailed information. Extensive experiments show that TCFormer consistently outperforms its counterparts on different challenging humancentric tasks and datasets, including whole-body pose estimation on COCO-WholeBody and 3D human mesh reconstruction on 3DPW.

Miscalibration can be exacerbated by overfitting due to the minimization of the cross-entropy during training, as it promotes the predicted softmax probabilities to match the one-hot label assignments. This yields a pre-softmax activation of the correct class that is significantly larger than the remaining activations. Recent evidence from the literature suggests that loss functions that embed implicit or explicit maximization of the entropy of predictions yield state-of-the-art calibration performances. We provide a unifying constrained-optimization perspective of current state-of-the-art calibration losses. Specifically, these losses could be viewed as approximations of a linear penalty (or a Lagrangian term) imposing equality constraints on logit distances. This points to an important limitation of such underlying equality constraints, whose ensuing gradients constantly push towards a non-informative solution, which might prevent from reaching the best compromise between the discriminative performance and calibration of the model during gradient-based optimization. Following our observations, we propose a simple and flexible generalization based on inequality constraints, which imposes a controllable margin on logit distances. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of image classification, semantic segmentation and NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our method sets novel state-of-the-art results on these tasks in terms of network calibration, without affecting the discriminative performance.

Current NLE models explain the decision-making process of a vision or vision-language model (a.k.a., task model), e.g., a VQA model, via a language model (a.k.a., explanation model), e.g., GPT. Other than the additional memory resources and inference time required by the task model, the task and explanation models are completely independent, which disassociates the explanation from the reasoning process made to predict the answer. We introduce NLX-GPT, a general, compact and faithful language model that can simultaneously predict an answer and explain it. We first conduct pre-training on large scale data of image-caption pairs for general understanding of images, and then formulate the answer as a text prediction task along with the explanation. Without region proposals nor a task model, our resulting overall framework attains better evaluation scores, contains much less parameters and is 15x faster than the current SoA model. We then address the problem of evaluating the explanations which can be in many times generic, data-biased and can come in several forms.

In this work, we propose RePaint: A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based inpainting approach that is applicable to even extreme masks. We employ a pretrained unconditional DDPM as the generative prior. To condition the generation process, we only alter the reverse diffusion iterations by sampling the unmasked regions using the given image information.

Our method leverages an off-the-shelf object detector to identify visual objects from unlabeled images, and then language queries for these objects are obtained in an unsupervised fashion with a pseudo-query generation module.

This framework is designed in a simple architecture that efficiently extracts point-wise features from RGB-D data using a fully convolutional network, called XYZNet, and directly regresses the 6D pose without any post refinement. In the case of symmetric object, one object has multiple ground-truth poses, and this one-to-many relationship may lead to estimation ambiguity. In order to solve this ambiguity problem, we design a symmetry-invariant pose distance metric, called average (maximum) grouped primitives distance or A(M)GPD. The proposed A(M)GPD loss can make the regression network converge to the correct state, i.e., all minima in the A(M)GPD loss surface are mapped to the correct poses.

Existing multimodal classification algorithms mainly focus on improving performance by exploiting the complementarity from different modalities. However, conventional approaches are basically weak in providing trustworthy multimodal fusion, especially for safety-critical applications (e.g., medical diagnosis). For this issue, we propose a novel trustworthy multimodal classification algorithm termed Multimodal Dynamics, which dynamically evaluates both the feature-level and modality-level informativeness for different samples and thus trustworthily integrates multiple modalities. Specifically, a sparse gating is introduced to capture the information variation of each within-modality feature and the true class probability is employed to assess the classification confidence of each modality. Then a transparent fusion algorithm based on the dynamical informativeness estimation strategy is induced. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly model both feature and modality variation for different samples to provide trustworthy fusion in multi-modal classification. Extensive experiments are conducted on multimodal medical classification datasets. In these experiments, superior performance and trustworthiness of our algorithm are clearly validated compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}

NGSP solves this problem via MAP inference, modeling the posterior probability of a label assignment conditioned on an input shape with a learned likelihood function. To make this search tractable, NGSP employs a neural guide network that learns to approximate the posterior. NGSP finds high-probability label assignments by first sampling proposals with the guide network and then evaluating each proposal under the full likelihood. We evaluate NGSP on the task of fine-grained semantic segmentation of manufactured 3D shapes from PartNet, where shapes have been decomposed into regions that correspond to part instance over-segmentations. We find that NGSP delivers significant performance improvements over comparison methods that (i) use regions to group per-point predictions, (ii) use regions as a self-supervisory signal or (iii) assign labels to regions under alternative formulations. Further, we show that NGSP maintains strong performance even with limited labeled data or noisy input shape regions.

To alleviate computational load, we project both point clouds and images into the bird-eye-view maps to compute sparse grid-wise self-attention. LIFT also benefits from a cross-sensor and cross-time data augmentation scheme. We evaluate the proposed approach on the challenging nuScenes and Waymo datasets, where our LIFT performs well over the state-of-the-art and strong baselines."}

However, the automatic design of loss functions for generic tasks with various evaluation metrics remains under-investigated. Previous works on handcrafting loss functions heavily rely on human expertise, which limits their extensibility. Meanwhile, searching for loss functions is nontrivial due to the vast search space. Existing efforts mainly tackle the issue by employing task-specific heuristics on specific tasks and particular metrics. Such work cannot be extended to other tasks without arduous human effort. In this paper, we propose AutoLoss-Zero, which is a general framework for searching loss functions from scratch for generic tasks. Specifically, we design an elementary search space composed only of primitive mathematical operators to accommodate the heterogeneous tasks and evaluation metrics. A variant of the evolutionary algorithm is employed to discover loss functions in the elementary search space. A loss-rejection protocol and a gradient-equivalence-check strategy are developed so as to improve the search efficiency, which are applicable to generic tasks. Extensive experiments on various computer vision tasks demonstrate that our searched loss functions are on par with or superior to existing loss functions, which generalize well to different datasets and networks.

Previous works leverage auxiliary pixel-level supervision and domain generalization approaches to address unseen spoof types. However, the local characteristics of image captures, i.e., capturing devices and presenting materials, are ignored in existing works and we argue that such information is required for networks to discriminate between live and spoof images. In this work, we propose PatchNet which reformulates face anti-spoofing as a fine-grained patch-type recognition problem. To be specific, our framework recognizes the combination of capturing devices and presenting materials based on the patches cropped from non-distorted face images. This reformulation can largely improve the data variation and enforce the network to learn discriminative feature from local capture patterns. In addition, to further improve the generalization ability of the spoof feature, we propose the novel Asymmetric Margin-based Classification Loss and Self-supervised Similarity Loss to regularize the patch embedding space. Our experimental results verify our assumption and show that the model is capable of recognizing unseen spoof types robustly by only looking at local regions. Moreover, the fine-grained and patch-level reformulation of FAS outperforms the existing approaches on intra-dataset, cross-dataset, and domain generalization benchmarks. Furthermore, our PatchNet framework can enable practical applications like Few-Shot Reference-based FAS and facilitate future exploration of spoof-related intrinsic cues."}

Unlike existing instance-level or category-level methods, OnePose does not rely on CAD models and can handle objects in arbitrary categories without instance- or category-specific network training. OnePose draws the idea from visual localization and only requires a simple RGB video scan of the object to build a sparse SfM model of the object. Then, this model is registered to new query images with a generic feature matching network. To mitigate the slow runtime of existing visual localization methods, we propose a new graph attention network that directly matches 2D interest points in the query image with the 3D points in the SfM model, resulting in efficient and robust pose estimation. Combined with a feature-based pose tracker, OnePose is able to stably detect and track 6D poses of everyday household objects in real-time. We also collected a large-scale dataset that consists of 450 se- quences of 150 objects. Code and data are available at the project page: https://zju3dv.github.io/onepose/."}

However, a common problem for the implicit-based methods is that they cannot produce separated and topology-consistent mesh for each garment piece, which is crucial for the current 3D content creation pipeline. To address this issue, we proposed a novel geometry inference framework ReEF that reconstructs topology- consistent layered garment mesh by registering the explicit garment template to the whole-body implicit fields predicted from single images. Experiments demonstrate that our method notably outperforms the counterparts on single-image layered garment reconstruction and could bring high-quality digital assets for further content creation."}

However, ViT models suffer from huge number of parameters, restricting their applicability on devices with limited computation. To alleviate this problem, we propose MiniViT, a new compression framework, which achieves parameter reduction in vision transformers while retaining the same performance. The central idea of MiniViT is to multiplex the weights of consecutive transformer blocks. More specifically, we make the weights shared across layers, while imposing a transformation on the weights to increase diversity. Weight distillation over self-attention is also applied to transfer knowledge from large-scale ViT models to weight-multiplexed compact models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of MiniViT, showing that it can reduce the size of the pre-trained Swin-B transformer by 48%, while achieving an increase of 1.0% in top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Moreover, using a single-layer parameters, MiniViT is able to compress DeiT-B by 9.7 times from 86M to 9M parameters, without seriously compromising the performance. Finally, we verify the transferability of MiniViT by reporting its performance on downstream benchmarks. Code and models are available at here."}

This is challenging, because it requires reasoning about the complex articulation of the human hand and the intricate physical interaction with the object. We propose a novel method that frames this problem in the reinforcement learning framework and leverages a physics simulation, both to learn and to evaluate such dynamic interactions. A hierarchical approach decomposes the task into low-level grasping and high-level motion synthesis. It can be used to generate novel hand sequences that approach, grasp, and move an object to a desired location, while retaining human-likeness. We show that our approach leads to stable grasps and generates a wide range of motions. Furthermore, even imperfect labels can be corrected by our method to generate dynamic interaction sequences."}

However, most transformer-based captioning methods ever overlook two kinds of elusive confounders: the visual confounder and the linguistic confounder, which generally lead to harmful bias, induce the spurious correlations during training, and degrade the model generalization. In this paper, we first use Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to show how two confounders damage the image captioning. Then we apply the backdoor adjustment to propose a novel causal inference based image captioning (CIIC) framework, which consists of an interventional object detector (IOD) and an interventional transformer decoder (ITD) to jointly confront both confounders. In the encoding stage, the IOD is able to disentangle the region-based visual features by deconfounding the visual confounder. In the decoding stage, the ITD introduces causal intervention into the transformer decoder and deconfounds the visual and linguistic confounders simultaneously. Two modules collaborate with each other to alleviate the spurious correlations caused by the unobserved confounders. When tested on MSCOCO, our proposal significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art encoder-decoder models on Karpathy split and online test split.

We further introduce a Neural Blend-Field to learn sophisticated details by adaptively blending a series of local fields.

Moreover, we present a novel feature lifting module for bridging the gap between 2D and 3D representations. This module begins with a map-based position regression (MapReg) block to integrate the merits of both heatmap encoding and position regression paradigms for improved 2D accuracy and temporal coherence. Furthermore, MapReg is followed by pose pooling and pose-to-vertex lifting approaches, which transform 2D pose encodings to semantic features of 3D vertices. Overall, our hand reconstruction framework, called MobRecon, comprises affordable computational costs and miniature model size, which reaches a high inference speed of 83FPS on Apple A14 CPU.

Recent advances align class-conditional distributions by narrowing down cross-domain prototypes (class centers). Though great success, they ignore the significant within-class variance and the domain-mismatched semantics within the training batch, leading to a sub-optimal adaptation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel SemantIc-complete Graph MAtching (SIGMA) framework for DAOD, which completes mismatched semantics and reformulates the adaptation with graph matching. Specifically, we design a Graph-embedded Semantic Completion module (GSC) that completes mismatched semantics through generating hallucination graph nodes in missing categories. Then, we establish cross-image graphs to model class-conditional distributions and learn a graph-guided memory bank for better semantic completion in turn. After representing the source and target data as graphs, we reformulate the adaptation as a graph matching problem, i.e., finding well-matched node pairs across graphs to reduce the domain gap, which is solved with a novel Bipartite Graph Matching adaptor (BGM). In a nutshell, we utilize graph nodes to establish semantic-aware node affinity and leverage graph edges as quadratic constraints in a structure-aware matching loss, achieving fine-grained adaptation with a node-to-node graph matching. Extensive experiments verify that SIGMA outperforms existing works significantly. Our codes are available at https://github.com/CityU-AIM-Group/SIGMA."}

However, some topology of the original shape is missing, existing methods directly predict the location of complete points, without predicting structured and topological information of the complete shape, which leads to inferior performance. To better tackle the missing topology part, we propose LAKe-Net, a novel topology-aware point cloud completion model by localizing aligned keypoints, with a novel Keypoints-Skeleton-Shape prediction manner. Specifically, our method completes missing topology using three steps: Aligned Keypoint Localization. An asymmetric keypoint locator, including an unsupervised multi-scale keypoint detector and a complete keypoint generator, is proposed for localizing aligned keypoints from complete and partial point clouds. We theoretically prove that the detector can capture aligned keypoints for objects within a sub-category. Surface-skeleton Generation. A new type of skeleton, named Surface-skeleton, is generated from keypoints based on geometric priors to fully represent the topological information captured from keypoints and better recover the local details. Shape Refinement. We design a refinement subnet where multi-scale surface-skeletons are fed into each recursive skeleton-assisted refinement module to assist the completion process.

However, how to best interpolate images is not well defined. Recent mixup methods overlay or cut-and-paste two or more objects into one image, which needs care in selecting regions. Mixup has also been connected to autoencoders, because often autoencoders generate an image that continuously deforms into another. However, such images are typically of low quality. In this work, we revisit mixup from the deformation perspective and introduce AlignMixup, where we geometrically align two images in the feature space. The correspondences allow us to interpolate between two sets of features, while keeping the locations of one set. Interestingly, this retains mostly the geometry or pose of one image and the appearance or texture of the other. We also show that an autoencoder can still improve representation learning under mixup, without the classifier ever seeing decoded images. AlignMixup outperforms state-of-the-art mixup methods on five different benchmarks."}

However, it is difficult to directly apply flow-based models to dynamic point cloud classification since the unstructured points make it hard or even impossible to efficiently and effectively trace point-wise correspondences. To capture 3D motions without explicitly tracking correspondences, we propose a kinematics-inspired neural network (Kinet) by generalizing the kinematic concept of ST-surfaces to the feature space. By unrolling the normal solver of ST-surfaces in the feature space, Kinet implicitly encodes feature-level dynamics and gains advantages from the use of mature backbones for static point cloud processing. With only minor changes in network structures and low computing overhead, it is painless to jointly train and deploy our framework with a given static model. Experiments on NvGesture, SHREC'17, MSRAction-3D, and NTU-RGBD demonstrate its efficacy in performance, efficiency in both the number of parameters and computational complexity, as well as its versatility to various static backbones. Noticeably, Kinet achieves the accuracy of 93.27% on MSRAction-3D with only 3.20M parameters and 10.35G FLOPS. The code is available at https://github.com/jx-zhong-for-academic-purpose/Kinet."}

To tackle this challenge, we propose Hierarchical Vector Transformer (HiVT) for fast and accurate multi-agent motion prediction. By decomposing the problem into local context extraction and global interaction modeling, our method can effectively and efficiently model a large number of agents in the scene. Meanwhile, we propose a translation-invariant scene representation and rotation-invariant spatial learning modules, which extract features robust to the geometric transformations of the scene and enable the model to make accurate predictions for multiple agents in a single forward pass.

Inspired by existing hyperspectral cameras that are either slow, expensive, or bulky, reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a low-budget snapshot measurement has drawn wide attention. By mapping a truncated numerical optimization algorithm into a network with a fixed number of phases, recent deep unfolding networks (DUNs) for spectral snapshot compressive sensing (SCI) have achieved remarkable success. However, DUNs are far from reaching the scope of industrial applications limited by the lack of cross-phase feature interaction and adaptive parameter adjustment. In this paper, we propose a novel Hyperspectral Explicable Reconstruction and Optimal Sampling deep Network for SCI, dubbed HerosNet, which includes several phases under the ISTA-unfolding framework. Each phase can flexibly simulate the sensing matrix and contextually adjust the step size in the gradient descent step, and hierarchically fuse and interact the hidden states of previous phases to effectively recover current HSI frames in the proximal mapping step. Simultaneously, a hardware-friendly optimal binary mask is learned end-to-end to further improve the reconstruction performance.

Our method is based on a learnable and unified l1 sparsity constraint with pre-defined factors to reflect the global importance in the continuous searching space of different dimensions.

But how do these improvements stack-up against recent advances in self-supervised learning? Motivated by this we present an alternative approach based on contrastive learning and compare their performance on standard few-shot part segmentation benchmarks. Our experiments reveal that not only do the GAN-based approach offer no significant performance advantage, their multi-step training is complex, nearly an order-of-magnitude slower, and can introduce additional bias. These experiments suggest that the inductive biases of generative models, such as their ability to disentangle shape and texture, are well captured by standard feed-forward networks trained using contrastive learning."}

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to develop appropriate and reliable evaluation measures for new applications where conventional measures are not well suited. Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) is one such application, and the current practice is to use R@K,\\theta for evaluating VMR systems. However, this measure has two disadvantages. First, it is rank-insensitive: It ignores the rank positions of successfully localised moments in the top-K ranked list by treating the list as a set. Second, it binarises the Intersection over Union (IoU) of each retrieved video moment using the threshold \\theta and thereby ignoring fine-grained localisation quality of ranked moments. We propose an alternative measure for evaluating VMR, called Average Max IoU (AxIoU), which is free from the above two problems. We show that AxIoU satisfies two important axioms for VMR evaluation, namely, Invariance against Redundant Moments and Monotonicity with respect to the Best Moment, and also that R@K,\\theta satisfies the first axiom only. We also empirically examine how AxIoU agrees with R@K,\\theta, as well as its stability with respect to change in the test data and human-annotated temporal boundaries."}

Based on this success, recent work on image editing proceeds by projecting images to the GAN latent space and manipulating the latent vector. However, these approaches are limited in that only images from a narrow domain can be transformed, and with only a limited number of editing operations. We propose FlexIT, a novel method which can take any input image and a user-defined text instruction for editing. Our method achieves flexible and natural editing, pushing the limits of semantic image translation. First, FlexIT combines the input image and text into a single target point in the CLIP multimodal embedding space. Via the latent space of an autoencoder, we iteratively transform the input image toward the target point, ensuring coherence and quality with a variety of novel regularization terms.

Existing studies tackle the data bias problem using only labeled facial expression dataset. Orthogonal to existing FER methods, we propose to utilize large unlabeled face recognition (FR) datasets to enhance FER. However, this raises another data bias problem---the distribution mismatch between FR and FER data. To combat the mismatch, we propose the Meta-Face2Exp framework, which consists of a base network and an adaptation network. The base network learns prior expression knowledge on class-balanced FER data while the adaptation network is trained to fit the pseudo labels of FR data generated by the base model. To combat the mismatch between FR and FER data, Meta-Face2Exp uses a circuit feedback mechanism, which improves the base network with the feedback from the adaptation network. Experiments show that our Meta-Face2Exp achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art FER methods with 10% of the labeled FER data utilized by the baselines. We also demonstrate that the circuit feedback mechanism successfully eliminates data bias."}

Specifically, beyond the visual cues in RGB images, we rely on the shape information predominately from the depth (D) channel. The key idea is to explore the shape alignment of each instance against its corresponding category-level template shape, and the symmetric correspondence of each object category for estimating a coarse 3D object shape. Our framework deforms the point cloud of the category-level template shape to align the observed instance point cloud for implicitly representing its 3D rotation. Then we model the symmetric correspondence by predicting symmetric point cloud from the partially observed point cloud. The concatenation of the observed point cloud and symmetric one reconstructs a coarse object shape, thus facilitating object center (3D translation) and 3D size estimation. Extensive experiments on the category-level NOCS benchmark demonstrate that our lightweight model still competes with state-of-the-art approaches that require labeled real-world images. We also deploy our approach to a physical Baxter robot to perform grasping tasks on unseen but category-known instances, and the results further validate the efficacy of our proposed model.

In contrast to single object scenes (on which NeRFs are traditionally evaluated), our scale poses multiple challenges including (1) the need to model thousands of images with varying lighting conditions, each of which capture only a small subset of the scene, (2) prohibitively large model capacities that make it infeasible to train on a single GPU, and (3) significant challenges for fast rendering that would enable interactive fly-throughs. To address these challenges, we begin by analyzing visibility statistics for large-scale scenes, motivating a sparse network structure where parameters are specialized to different regions of the scene. We introduce a simple geometric clustering algorithm for data parallelism that partitions training images (or rather pixels) into different NeRF submodules that can be trained in parallel. We evaluate our approach on existing datasets (Quad 6k and UrbanScene3D) as well as against our own drone footage, improving training speed by 3x and PSNR by 12%. We also evaluate recent NeRF fast renderers on top of Mega-NeRF and introduce a novel method that exploits temporal coherence. Our technique achieves a 40x speedup over conventional NeRF rendering while remaining within 0.8 db in PSNR quality, exceeding the fidelity of existing fast renderers."}

This allows non-expert users to create a detailed and personalized virtual copy of themselves, which can be animated with realistic clothing deformations. PINA does not require complete scans, nor does it require a prior learned from large datasets of clothed humans. Learning a complete avatar in this setting is challenging, since only few depth observations are available, which are noisy and incomplete (i.e. only partial visibility of the body per frame). We propose a method to learn the shape and non-rigid deformations via a pose-conditioned implicit surface and a deformation field, defined in canonical space. This allows us to fuse all partial observations into a single consistent canonical representation. Fusion is formulated as a global optimization problem over the pose, shape and skinning parameters. The method can learn neural avatars from real noisy RGB-D sequences for a diverse set of people and clothing styles and these avatars can be animated given unseen motion sequences."}

Despite the tremendous progress of deep learning-based optical flow methods, it remains a challenge to accurately estimate large displacements with motion blur. This is mainly because the correlation volume, the basis of pixel matching, is computed as the dot product of the convolutional features of the two images. The locality of convolutional features makes the computed correlations susceptible to various noises. On large displacements with motion blur, noisy correlations could cause severe errors in the estimated flow. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new architecture \"CRoss-Attentional Flow Transformer\" (CRAFT), aiming to revitalize the correlation volume computation. In CRAFT, a Semantic Smoothing Transformer layer transforms the features of one frame, making them more global and semantically stable. In addition, the dot-product correlations are replaced with transformer Cross-Frame Attention. This layer filters out feature noises through the Query and Key projections, and computes more accurate correlations. On Sintel (Final) and KITTI (foreground) benchmarks, CRAFT has achieved new state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, to test the robustness of different models on large motions, we designed an image shifting attack that shifts input images to generate large artificial motions. Under this attack, CRAFT performs much more robustly than two representative methods, RAFT and GMA. The code of CRAFT is is available at https://github.com/askerlee/craft."}

The standard solution is to apply the straight-through estimator (STE), using different functions during the inference and gradient computation steps. Several STE variants have been proposed in the literature aiming to maximise the task accuracy of the trained network. In this paper, we analyse STE variants and study their impact on QNN training. We first observe that most such variants can be modelled as stochastic regularisations of stair functions; although this intuitive interpretation is not new, our rigorous discussion generalises to further variants. Then, we analyse QNNs mixing different regularisations, finding that some suitably synchronised smoothing of each layer map is required to guarantee pointwise compositional convergence to the target discontinuous function. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose additive noise annealing (ANA), a new algorithm to train QNNs encompassing standard STE and its variants as special cases. When testing ANA on the CIFAR-10 image classification benchmark, we find that the major impact on task accuracy is not due to the qualitative shape of the regularisations but to the proper synchronisation of the different STE variants used in a network, in accordance with the theoretical results."}

Therefore, it is beneficial to super-resolve a 360deg image. Several attempts have been made, but mostly considered equirectangular projection (ERP) as one of the ways for 360deg image representation despite the latitude-dependent distortions. In that case, as the output high-resolution (HR) image is always in the same ERP format as the lowresolution (LR) input, additional information loss may occur when transforming the HR image to other projection types. In this paper, we propose SphereSR, a novel framework to generate a continuous spherical image representation from an LR 360deg image, with the goal of predicting the RGB values at given spherical coordinates for superresolution with an arbitrary 360deg image projection. Specifically, first we propose a feature extraction module that represents the spherical data based on an icosahedron and that efficiently extracts features on the spherical surface. We then propose a spherical local implicit image function (SLIIF) to predict RGB values at the spherical coordinates. As such, SphereSR flexibly reconstructs an HR image given an arbitrary projection type. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that the proposed method significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of performance."}

It enables spatial interaction between grid features, as sampled from boxes of interest, and improves the learning capability of transformers for several vision tasks. Specifically, we present BoxeR, short for Box Transformer, which attends to a set of boxes by predicting their transformation from a reference window on an input feature map. The BoxeR computes attention weights on these boxes by considering its grid structure. Notably, BoxeR-2D naturally reasons about box information within its attention module, making it suitable for end-to-end instance detection and segmentation tasks. By learning invariance to rotation in the box-attention module, BoxeR-3D is capable of generating discriminative information from a bird's-eye view plane for 3D end-to-end object detection. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed BoxeR-2D achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO detection and instance segmentation. Besides, BoxeR-3D improves over the end-to-end 3D object detection baseline and already obtains a compelling performance for the vehicle category of Waymo Open, without any class-specific optimization.

The proposed network synergically combines 3D CNN, 2D CNN, and Transformer for accurate AD classification. The 3D CNN is used to perform natively 3D representation learning, while 2D CNN is used to utilize the pre-trained weights on large 2D databases and 2D representation learning. It is possible to efficiently extract the locality information for AD-related abnormalities in the local brain using CNN networks with inductive bias. The transformer network is also used to obtain attention relationships among multi-plane (axial, coronal, and sagittal) and multi-slice images after CNN. It is also possible to learn the abnormalities distributed over the wider region in the brain using the transformer without inductive bias. In this experiment, we used a training dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) which contains a total of 4,786 3D T1-weighted MRI images. For the validation data, we used dataset from three different institutions: The Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL), The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), and some set of ADNI data independent from the training dataset. Our proposed M3T is compared to conventional 3D classification networks based on an area under the curve (AUC) and classification accuracy for AD classification. This study represents that the proposed network M3T achieved the highest performance in multi-institutional validation database, and demonstrates the feasibility of the method to efficiently combine CNN and Transformer for 3D medical images."}

However, previous works only consider pair-wise interactions with limited relational reasoning. To promote more comprehensive interaction modeling for relational reasoning, we propose GroupNet, a multiscale hypergraph neural network, which is novel in terms of both interaction capturing and representation learning. From the aspect of interaction capturing, we propose a trainable multiscale hypergraph to capture both pair-wise and group-wise interactions at multiple group sizes. From the aspect of interaction representation learning, we propose a three-element format that can be learnt end-to-end and explicitly reason some relational factors including the interaction strength and category. We apply GroupNet into both CVAE-based prediction system and previous state-of-the-art prediction systems for predicting socially plausible trajectories with relational reasoning. To validate the ability of relational reasoning, we experiment with synthetic physics simulations to reflect the ability to capture group behaviors, reason interaction strength and interaction category. To validate the effectiveness of prediction, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world trajectory prediction datasets, including NBA, SDD and ETH-UCY; and we show that with GroupNet, the CVAE-based prediction system outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also show that adding GroupNet will further improve the performance of previous state-of-the-art prediction systems."}

Here, an agent must produce a plausible sequence of actions that can transform the environment from a given start to a desired goal state. When learning procedure planning from instructional videos, most recent work leverages intermediate visual observations as supervision, which requires expensive annotation efforts to localize precisely all the instructional steps in training videos. In contrast, we remove the need for expensive temporal video annotations and propose a weakly supervised approach by learning from natural language instructions. Our model is based on a transformer equipped with a memory module, which maps the start and goal observations to a sequence of plausible actions. Furthermore, we augment our model with a probabilistic generative module to capture the uncertainty inherent to procedure planning, an aspect largely overlooked by previous work. We evaluate our model on three datasets and show our weakly-supervised approach outperforms previous fully supervised state-of-the-art models on multiple metrics."}

This is a challenging task because dogs exhibit a wide range of shapes and appearances, and are highly articulated. Recent work has proposed to directly regress the SMAL animal model, with additional limb scale parameters, from images. Our method, called BARC (Breed-Augmented Regression using Classification), goes beyond prior work in several important ways. First, we modify the SMAL shape space to be more appropriate for representing dog shape. But, even with a better shape model, the problem of regressing dog shape from an image is still challenging because we lack paired images with 3D ground truth. To compensate for the lack of paired data, we formulate novel losses that exploit information about dog breeds. In particular, we exploit the fact that dogs of the same breed have similar body shapes. We formulate a novel breed similarity loss consisting of two parts: One term encourages the shape of dogs from the same breed to be more similar than dogs of different breeds. The second one, a breed classification loss, helps to produce recognizable breed-specific shapes. Through ablation studies, we find that our breed losses significantly improve shape accuracy over a baseline without them. We also compare BARC qualitatively to WLDO with a perceptual study and find that our approach produces dogs that are significantly more realistic. This work shows that a-priori information about genetic similarity can help to compensate for the lack of 3D training data. This concept may be applicable to other animal species or groups of species. Our code is publicly available for research purposes at https://barc.is.tue.mpg.de/."}

In this paper we address this issue and significantly bridge the gap between these two types of models. Throughout our empirical investigation we do not aim to necessarily propose a new method, but strive to identify a robust and effective recipe for making state-of-the-art large scale models affordable in practice. We demonstrate that, when performed correctly, knowledge distillation can be a powerful tool for reducing the size of large models without compromising their performance. In particular, we uncover that there are certain implicit design choices, which may drastically affect the effectiveness of distillation. Our key contribution is the explicit identification of these design choices, which were not previously articulated in the literature. We back up our findings by a comprehensive empirical study, demonstrate compelling results on a wide range of vision datasets and, in particular, obtain a state-of-the-art ResNet-50 model for ImageNet, which achieves 82.8% top-1 accuracy."}

In this paper, we propose ProposalCLIP, a method towards unsupervised open-category object proposal generation. Unlike previous works which require a large number of bounding box annotations and/or can only generate proposals for limited object categories, our ProposalCLIP is able to predict proposals for a large variety of object categories without annotations, by exploiting CLIP (contrastive language-image pre-training) cues. Firstly, we analyze CLIP for unsupervised open-category proposal generation and design an objectness score based on our empirical analysis on proposal selection. Secondly, a graph-based merging module is proposed to solve the limitations of CLIP cues and merge fragmented proposals. Finally, we present a proposal regression module that extracts pseudo labels based on CLIP cues and trains a lightweight network to further refine proposals. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC, COCO and Visual Genome datasets show that our ProposalCLIP can better generate proposals than previous state-of-the-art methods. Our ProposalCLIP also shows benefits for downstream tasks, such as unsupervised object detection."}

We present Panoptic SegFormer, a general framework for panoptic segmentation with transformers. It contains three innovative components: an efficient deeply-supervised mask decoder, a query decoupling strategy, and an improved post-processing method. We also use Deformable DETR to efficiently process multi-scale features, which is a fast and efficient version of DETR. Specifically, we supervise the attention modules in the mask decoder in a layer-wise manner. This deep supervision strategy lets the attention modules quickly focus on meaningful semantic regions. It improves performance and reduces the number of required training epochs by half compared to Deformable DETR. Our query decoupling strategy decouples the responsibilities of the query set and avoids mutual interference between things and stuff. In addition, our post-processing strategy improves performance without additional costs by jointly considering classification and segmentation qualities to resolve conflicting mask overlaps. Our approach increases the accuracy 6.2% PQ over the baseline DETR model. Panoptic SegFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO test-dev with 56.2% PQ.

So this paper proposes the first free-style text-to-face method namely AnyFace enabling much wider open world applications such as metaverse, social media, cosmetics, forensics, etc. AnyFace has a novel two-stream framework for face image synthesis and manipulation given arbitrary descriptions of the human face. Specifically, one stream performs text-to-face generation and the other conducts face image reconstruction. Facial text and image features are extracted using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) encoders. And a collaborative Cross Modal Distillation (CMD) module is designed to align the linguistic and visual features across these two streams. Furthermore, a Diverse Triplet Loss (DT loss) is developed to model fine-grained features and improve facial diversity. Extensive experiments on Multi-modal CelebA-HQ and CelebAText-HQ demonstrate significant advantages of AnyFace over state-of-the-art methods. AnyFace can achieve high-quality, high-resolution, and high-diversity face synthesis and manipulation results without any constraints on the number and content of input captions."}

Current SGG methods typically utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) to acquire context information between objects/relationships. Despite their effectiveness, however, current SGG methods only assume scene graph homophily while ignoring heterophily. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel Heterophily Learning Network (HL-Net) to comprehensively explore the homophily and heterophily between objects/relationships in scene graphs. More specifically, HL-Net comprises the following 1) an adaptive reweighting transformer module, which adaptively integrates the information from different layers to exploit both the heterophily and homophily in objects; 2) a relationship feature propagation module that efficiently explores the connections between relationships by considering heterophily in order to refine the relationship representation; 3) a heterophily-aware message-passing scheme to further distinguish the heterophily and homophily between objects/relationships, thereby facilitating improved message passing in graphs. We conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets: Visual Genome (VG) and Open Images (OI). The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HL-Net over existing state-of-the-art approaches. In more detail, HL-Net outperforms the second-best competitors by 2.1% on the VG dataset for scene graph classification and 1.2% on the IO dataset for the final score."}

Specifically, we first learn a unique compact discrete codebook and the corresponding autoencoder to represent the target video. Built upon these representative discrete codes obtained from the entire target video, the subsequent discrete latent transformer is capable to infer proper codes for unknown areas under a self-attention mechanism, and thus produces fine-grained content with long-term spatial-temporal consistency. Moreover, we further explicitly enforce the short-term consistency to relieve temporal visual jitters via a temporal aggregation block among adjacent frames.

Our objective learns faster than alternatives, and performs well at scale: we pretrain on 20 million YouTube videos. Empirical results show that MERLOT Reserve learns strong multimodal representations. When finetuned, it sets state-of-the-art on Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), TVQA, and Kinetics-600; outperforming prior work by 5%, 7%, and 1.5% respectively. Ablations show that these tasks benefit from audio pretraining -- even VCR, a QA task centered around images (without sound). Moreover, our objective enables out-of-the-box prediction, revealing strong multimodal commonsense understanding. In a fully zero-shot setting, our model obtains competitive results on four video tasks, even outperforming supervised approaches on the recently proposed Situated Reasoning (STAR) benchmark.

In this paper, we propose a novel unified framework for incomplete and complete MVC named multi-view probabilistic clustering (MPC). MPC equivalently transforms multi-view pairwise posterior matching probability into composition of each view's individual distribution, which tolerates data missing and might extend to any number of views. Then graph-context-aware refinement with path propagation and co-neighbor propagation is used to refine pairwise probability, which alleviates the impact of noise and outliers. Finally, MPC also equivalently transforms probabilistic clustering's objective to avoid complete pairwise computation and adjusts clustering assignments by maximizing joint probability iteratively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks for incomplete and complete MVC show that MPC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency."}

The neural renderer employs a dynamic multi-scale scheme to efficiently handle arbitrary blur sizes, and it is trained to handle imperfect disparity input.

Prior works either simply align the global features of an image with its associated class semantic vector or utilize unidirectional attention to learn the limited latent semantic representations, which could not effectively discover the intrinsic semantic knowledge (e.g., attribute semantics) between visual and attribute features. To solve the above dilemma, we propose a Mutually Semantic Distillation Network (MSDN), which progressively distills the intrinsic semantic representations between visual and attribute features for ZSL. MSDN incorporates an attribute->visual attention sub-net that learns attribute-based visual features, and a visual->attribute attention sub-net that learns visual-based attribute features. By further introducing a semantic distillation loss, the two mutual attention sub-nets are capable of learning collaboratively and teaching each other throughout the training process. The proposed MSDN yields significant improvements over the strong baselines, leading to new state-of-the-art performances on three popular challenging benchmarks.

Our method works with black-box models: We do not require any prior knowledge of the architecture nor access to the model's internals, like parameters, activations or gradients. Our efficient perturbation-based approach empirically estimates the importance of each point by testing the model with randomly generated subsets of the input point cloud. Our sub-sampling strategy takes into account the special characteristics of LiDAR data, such as the depth-dependent point density.

Recently, DatasetGAN showcased a promising alternative - to synthesize a large labeled dataset via a generative adversarial network (GAN) by exploiting a small set of manually labeled, GAN-generated images. Here, we scale DatasetGAN to ImageNet scale of class diversity. We take image samples from the class-conditional generative model BigGAN trained on ImageNet, and manually annotate only 5 images per class, for all 1k classes. By training an effective feature segmentation architecture on top of BigGAN, we turn BigGAN into a labeled dataset generator. We further show that VQGAN can similarly serve as a dataset generator, leveraging the already annotated data. We create a new ImageNet benchmark by labeling an additional set of real images and evaluate segmentation performance in a variety of settings. Through an extensive ablation study we show big gains in leveraging a large generated dataset to train different supervised and self-supervised backbone models on pixel-wise tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using our synthesized datasets for pre-training leads to improvements over standard ImageNet pre-training on several downstream datasets, such as PASCAL-VOC, MS-COCO, Cityscapes and chest X-ray, as well as tasks (detection, segmentation). Our benchmark will be made public and maintain a leaderboard for this challenging task."}

Departure from these methods which maximize mutual information of two generated views, along either instance or feature dimension, the proposed paradigm introduces intermediate variables at the feature level, and maximizes the consistency between variables and representations of each view. Specifically, the proposed intermediate variables are the nearest group of base vectors to representations. Hence, we call the proposed method ARB (Align Representations with Base). Compared with other symmetric approaches, ARB 1) does not require negative pairs, which leads the complexity of the overall objective function is in linear order, 2) reduces feature redundancy, increasing the information density of training samples, 3) is more robust to output dimension size, which outperforms previous feature-wise arts over 28% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-100 under low-dimension settings."}

As a scalable alternative to direct 3D supervision, our work relies on segmented image collections for learning 3D of generic categories. Unlike prior works that use similar supervision but learn independent category-specific models from scratch, our approach of learning a unified model simplifies the training process while also allowing the model to benefit from the common structure across categories. Using image collections from standard recognition datasets, we show that our approach allows learning 3D inference for over 150 object categories. We evaluate using two datasets and qualitatively and quantitatively show that our unified reconstruction approach improves over prior category-specific reconstruction baselines. Our final 3D reconstruction model is also capable of zero-shot inference on images from unseen object categories and we empirically show that increasing the number of training categories improves the reconstruction quality."}

In particular, adversarial data augmentation strategies, which search augmentation maximizing task loss, show significant improvement in the model generalization for many tasks. However, the existing methods require careful parameter tuning to avoid excessively strong deformations that take away image features critical for acquiring generalization. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation optimization method based on the adversarial strategy called TeachAugment, which can produce informative transformed images to the model without requiring careful tuning by leveraging a teacher model. Specifically, the augmentation is searched so that augmented images are adversarial for the target model and recognizable for the teacher model. We also propose data augmentation using neural networks, which simplifies the search space design and allows for updating of the data augmentation using the gradient method. We show that TeachAugment outperforms existing methods in experiments of image classification, semantic segmentation, and unsupervised representation learning tasks."}

Model failures due to poor generalizability are quite common in practice and may prove quite perilous in mission-critical applications, e.g., diagnostic imaging where real-world data often exhibits pronounced variability. Such limitations have led to increased interest in domain generalization (DG) approaches that improve the ability of models learned from a single or multiple source domains to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) test domains. In this work, we propose BoosterNet, a lean add-on network that can be simply appended to any arbitrary core network to improve its generalization capability without requiring any changes in its architecture or training procedure. Specifically, using a novel measure of feature culpability, BoosterNet is trained episodically on the most and least culpable data features extracted from critical units in the core network based on their contribution towards class-specific prediction errors, which have shown to improve generalization. At inference time, corresponding test image features are extracted from the closest class-specific units, determined by smart gating via a Siamese network, and fed to BoosterNet for improved generalization. We evaluate the performance of BoosterNet within two very different classification problems, digits and skin lesions, and demonstrate a marked improvement in model generalization to OOD test domains compared to SOTA."}

Using the HDR-NeRF, we are able to generate both novel HDR views and novel LDR views under different exposures. The key to our method is to model the physical imaging process, which dictates that the radiance of a scene point transforms to a pixel value in the LDR image with two implicit functions: a radiance field and a tone mapper. The radiance field encodes the scene radiance (values vary from 0 to +infty), which outputs the density and radiance of a ray by giving corresponding ray origin and ray direction. The tone mapper models the mapping process that a ray hitting on the camera sensor becomes a pixel value. The color of the ray is predicted by feeding the radiance and the corresponding exposure time into the tone mapper. We use the classic volume rendering technique to project the output radiance, colors, and densities into HDR and LDR images, while only the input LDR images are used as the supervision. We collect a new forward-facing HDR dataset to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world scenes validate that our method can not only accurately control the exposures of synthesized views but also render views with a high dynamic range."}

Using Euclidean distance between correspondences to find neighbors and extract local information is a common strategy in previous works. However, most such works ignore similar sparse semantics information between two given images and cannot capture local topology among correspondences well. Therefore, to deal with the above problems, Multiple Sparse Semantics Dynamic Graph Network (MS^ 2 DG-Net) is proposed, in this paper, to predict probabilities of correspondences as inliers and recover camera poses. MS^ 2 DG-Net dynamically builds sparse semantics graphs based on sparse semantics similarity between two given images, to capture local topology among correspondences, while maintaining permutation-equivariant. Extensive experiments prove that MS^ 2 DG-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in outlier removal and camera pose estimation tasks on the public datasets with heavy outliers.

The proposed method is based on a parametric 3D face representation of the actor in the input scene that offers a reliable disentanglement of the facial identity from the head pose and facial expressions. It then uses a novel deep domain translation framework that alters the facial expressions in a consistent and plausible manner, taking into account their dynamics. Finally, the altered facial expressions are used to photo-realistically manipulate the facial region in the input scene based on an especially-designed neural face renderer. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to be capable of controlling the actor's facial expressions by even using as a sole input the semantic labels of the manipulated emotions, while at the same time preserving the speech-related lip movements. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations and comparisons, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and the especially promising results that we obtain.

However, most of such approaches are limited to closed surfaces as they require the space to be divided into inside and outside. More recent works based on unsigned distance function have been proposed to handle complex geometry containing both the open and closed surfaces. Nonetheless, as their direct outputs are point clouds, robustly obtaining high-quality meshing results from discrete points remains an open question. We present a novel learnable implicit representation, called the three-pole signed distance function (3PSDF), that can represent non-watertight 3D shapes with arbitrary topologies while supporting easy field-to-mesh conversion using the classic Marching Cubes algorithm. The key to our method is the introduction of a new sign, the NULL sign, in addition to the conventional in and out labels. The existence of the null sign could stop the formation of a closed isosurface derived from the bisector of the in/out regions. Further, we propose a dedicated learning framework to effectively learn 3PSDF without worrying about the vanishing gradient due to the null labels. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in a wide range of benchmarks both quantitatively and qualitatively."}

However, the existing methods mainly rely on recurrent or convolutional operation to model such temporal information, which limits the ability to capture non-local context relations of human motion. To address this problem, we propose a motion pose and shape network (MPS-Net) to effectively capture humans in motion to estimate accurate and temporally coherent 3D human pose and shape from a video. Specifically, we first propose a motion continuity attention (MoCA) module that leverages visual cues observed from human motion to adaptively recalibrate the range that needs attention in the sequence to better capture the motion continuity dependencies. Then, we develop a hierarchical attentive feature integration (HAFI) module to effectively combine adjacent past and future feature representations to strengthen temporal correlation and refine the feature representation of the current frame. By coupling the MoCA and HAFI modules, the proposed MPS-Net excels in estimating 3D human pose and shape in the video. Though conceptually simple, our MPS-Net not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M benchmark datasets, but also uses fewer network parameters.

To simplify this pipeline and unify the process of feature extraction and target information integration, we present a compact tracking framework, termed as MixFormer, built upon transformers. Our core design is to utilize the flexibility of attention operations, and propose a Mixed Attention Module (MAM) for simultaneous feature extraction and target information integration. This synchronous modeling scheme allows to extract target-specific discriminative features and perform extensive communication between target and search area. Based on MAM, we build our MixFormer tracking framework simply by stacking multiple MAMs with progressive patch embedding and placing a localization head on top. In addition, to handle multiple target templates during online tracking, we devise an asymmetric attention scheme in MAM to reduce computational cost, and propose an effective score prediction module to select high-quality templates.

Many multi-modal methods are proposed to alleviate this issue, while different representations of images and point clouds make it difficult to fuse them, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal framework SFD (Sparse Fuse Dense), which utilizes pseudo point clouds generated from depth completion to tackle the issues mentioned above. Different from prior works, we propose a new RoI fusion strategy 3D-GAF (3D Grid-wise Attentive Fusion) to make fuller use of information from different types of point clouds. Specifically, 3D-GAF fuses 3D RoI features from the pair of point clouds in a grid-wise attentive way, which is more fine-grained and more precise.

Compared to inpainting --- filling in missing pixels in a way coherent with the neighboring pixels --- outpainting can be achieved in more diverse ways since the problem is less constrained by the surrounding pixels. Existing image outpainting methods pose the problem as a conditional image-to-image translation task, often generating repetitive structures and textures by replicating the content available in the input image. In this work, we formulate the problem from the perspective of inverting generative adversarial networks. Our generator renders micro-patches conditioned on their joint latent code as well as their individual positions in the image. To outpaint an image, we seek for multiple latent codes not only recovering available patches but also synthesizing diverse outpainting by patch-based generation. This leads to richer structure and content in the outpainted regions. Furthermore, our formulation allows for outpainting conditioned on the categorical input, thereby enabling flexible user controls. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the proposed method performs favorably against existing in- and outpainting methods, featuring higher visual quality and diversity."}

Prior literature primarily resorts to sample selection methods for combating noisy labels. However, these approaches focus on dividing samples by order sorting or threshold selection, inevitably introducing hyper-parameters (e.g., selection ratio / threshold) that are hard-to-tune and dataset-dependent. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective approach named PNP (Probabilistic Noise Prediction) to explicitly model label noise. Specifically, we simultaneously train two networks, in which one predicts the category label and the other predicts the noise type. By predicting label noise probabilistically, we identify noisy samples and adopt dedicated optimization objectives accordingly. Finally, we establish a joint loss for network update by unifying the classification loss, the auxiliary constraint loss, and the in-distribution consistency loss. Comprehensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method."}

Recent progress on unsupervised pretraining methods shows superior transfer performance to their supervised counterparts. This paper revisits this phenomenon and sheds new light on understanding the transferability gap between unsupervised and supervised pretraining from a multilayer perceptron (MLP) perspective. While previous works focus on the effectiveness of MLP on unsupervised image classification where pretraining and evaluation are conducted on the same dataset, we reveal that the MLP projector is also the key factor to better transferability of unsupervised pretraining methods than supervised pretraining methods. Based on this observation, we attempt to close the transferability gap between supervised and unsupervised pretraining by adding an MLP projector before the classifier in supervised pretraining. Our analysis indicates that the MLP projector can help retain intra-class variation of visual features, decrease the feature distribution distance between pretraining and evaluation datasets, and reduce feature redundancy. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that the added MLP projector significantly boosts the transferability of supervised pretraining, e.g. +7.2% top-1 accuracy on the concept generalization task, +5.8% top-1 accuracy for linear evaluation on 12-domain classification tasks, and +0.8% AP on COCO object detection task, making supervised pretraining comparable or even better than unsupervised pretraining."}

However, almost all existing SGG models have overlooked the ground-truth annotation qualities of prevailing SGG datasets, i.e., they always assume: 1) all the manually annotated positive samples are equally correct; 2) all the un-annotated negative samples are absolutely background. In this paper, we argue that both assumptions are inapplicable to SGG: there are numerous \"noisy\" ground-truth predicate labels that break these two assumptions, and these noisy samples actually harm the training of unbiased SGG models. To this end, we propose a novel model-agnostic NoIsy label CorrEction strategy for SGG: NICE. NICE can not only detect noisy samples but also reassign more high-quality predicate labels to them. After the NICE training, we can obtain a cleaner version of SGG dataset for model training. Specifically, NICE consists of three components: negative Noisy Sample Detection (Neg-NSD), positive NSD (Pos-NSD), and Noisy Sample Correction (NSC). Firstly, in Neg-NSD, we formulate this task as an out-of-distribution detection problem, and assign pseudo labels to all detected noisy negative samples. Then, in Pos-NSD, we use a clustering-based algorithm to divide all positive samples into multiple sets, and treat the samples in the noisiest set as noisy positive samples. Lastly, in NSC, we use a simple but effective weighted KNN to reassign new predicate labels to noisy positive samples. Extensive results on different backbones and tasks have attested to the effectiveness and generalization abilities of each component of NICE."}

One of the key challenges behind this task is leveraging the referring expression for highlighting relevant positions in the image. A paradigm for tackling this problem is to leverage a powerful vision-language (\"cross-modal\") decoder to fuse features independently extracted from a vision encoder and a language encoder. Recent methods have made remarkable advancements in this paradigm by exploiting Transformers as cross-modal decoders, concurrent to the Transformer's overwhelming success in many other vision-language tasks. Adopting a different approach in this work, we show that significantly better cross-modal alignments can be achieved through the early fusion of linguistic and visual features in intermediate layers of a vision Transformer encoder network. By conducting cross-modal feature fusion in the visual feature encoding stage, we can leverage the well-proven correlation modeling power of a Transformer encoder for excavating helpful multi-modal context. This way, accurate segmentation results are readily harvested with a light-weight mask predictor. Without bells and whistles, our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art methods on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and G-Ref by large margins."}

Due to the domain gap and label shift between two domains, pseudo-labeled target data contains mixed closed-set and open-set label noises. In this paper, we propose a simplex noise transition matrix (SimT) to model the mixed noise distributions in DA semantic segmentation and formulate the problem as estimation of SimT. By exploiting computational geometry analysis and properties of segmentation, we design three complementary regularizers, i.e. volume regularization, anchor guidance, convex guarantee, to approximate the true SimT. Specifically, volume regularization minimizes the volume of simplex formed by rows of the non-square SimT, which ensures outputs of segmentation model to fit into the ground truth label distribution. To compensate for the lack of open-set knowledge, anchor guidance and convex guarantee are devised to facilitate the modeling of open-set noise distribution and enhance the discriminative feature learning among closed-set and open-set classes. The estimated SimT is further utilized to correct noise issues in pseudo labels and promote the generalization ability of segmentation model on target domain data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SimT can be flexibly plugged into existing DA methods to boost the performance.

CNNs contain parameters arranged in K x K filters. Standard unstructured pruning (SP) reduces the memory footprint of CNNs by setting filter elements to zero, thereby specifying a fixed subspace that constrains the filter. Especially if pruning is applied before or during training, this induces a strong bias. To overcome this, we introduce interspace pruning (IP), a general tool to improve existing pruning methods. It uses filters represented in a dynamic interspace by linear combinations of an underlying adaptive filter basis (FB). For IP, FB coefficients are set to zero while un-pruned coefficients and FBs are trained jointly. In this work, we provide mathematical evidence for IP's superior performance and demonstrate that IP outperforms SP on all tested state-of-the-art unstructured pruning methods. Especially in challenging situations, like pruning for ImageNet or pruning to high sparsity, IP greatly exceeds SP with equal runtime and parameter costs. Finally, we show that advances of IP are due to improved trainability and superior generalization ability."}

Training models to perform this task is complicated because paired (shape, program) data is not readily available for many domains, making exact supervised learning infeasible. However, it is possible to get paired data by compromising the accuracy of either the assigned program labels or the shape distribution. Wake-sleep methods use samples from a generative model of shape programs to approximate the distribution of real shapes. In self-training, shapes are passed through a recognition model, which predicts programs that are treated as 'pseudo-labels' for those shapes. Related to these approaches, we introduce a novel self-training variant unique to program inference, where program pseudo-labels are paired with their executed output shapes, avoiding label mismatch at the cost of an approximate shape distribution. We propose to group these regimes under a single conceptual framework, where training is performed with maximum likelihood updates sourced from either Pseudo-Labels or an Approximate Distribution (PLAD). We evaluate these techniques on multiple 2D and 3D shape program inference domains. Compared with policy gradient reinforcement learning, we show that PLAD techniques infer more accurate shape programs and converge significantly faster. Finally, we propose to combine updates from different PLAD methods within the training of a single model, and find that this approach outperforms any individual technique."}

Sparsely annotated object detection, which can largely reduce the annotations, is very challenging since the missingannotated instances would be regarded as the background during training. In this paper, we propose a sparselysupervised 3D object detection method, named SS3D. Aiming to eliminate the negative supervision caused by the missing annotations, we design a missing-annotated instance mining module with strict filtering strategies to mine positive instances. In the meantime, we design a reliable background mining module and a point cloud filling data augmentation strategy to generate the confident data for iteratively learning with reliable supervision. The proposed SS3D is a general framework that can be used to learn any modern 3D object detector. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset reveal that on different 3D detectors, the proposed SS3D framework with only 20% annotations required can achieve on-par performance comparing to fullysupervised methods. Comparing with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised 3D objection detection on KITTI, our SS3D improves the benchmarks by significant margins under the same annotation workload. Moreover, our SS3D also outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised method by remarkable margins, highlighting its effectiveness."}

Existing few-shot methods focus primarily on the categories sampled from the same distribution. Nevertheless, this assumption cannot always be ensured. The actual domain shift problem significantly reduces the performance of few-shot learning. To remedy this problem, we propose an interesting and challenging cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation task, where the training and test tasks perform on different domains. Specifically, we first propose a meta-memory bank to improve the generalization of the segmentation network by bridging the domain gap between source and target domains. The meta-memory stores the intra-domain style information from source domain instances and transfers it to target samples. Subsequently, we adopt a new contrastive learning strategy to explore the knowledge of different categories during the training stage. The negative and positive pairs are obtained from the proposed memory-based style augmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves promising results on cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation tasks on COCO-20, PASCAL-5, FSS-1000, and SUIM datasets."}

Recent works have shown promising results by training neural radiance field (NeRF) generators on unstructured 2D images, but still cannot generate highly-realistic images with fine details. A critical reason is that the high memory and computation cost of volumetric representation learning greatly restricts the number of point samples for radiance integration during training. Deficient sampling not only limits the expressive power of the generator to handle fine details but also impedes effective GAN training due to the noise caused by unstable Monte Carlo sampling. We propose a novel approach that regulates point sampling and radiance field learning on 2D manifolds, embodied as a set of learned implicit surfaces in the 3D volume. For each viewing ray, we calculate ray-surface intersections and accumulate their radiance generated by the network. By training and rendering such radiance manifolds, our generator can produce high quality images with realistic fine details and strong visual 3D consistency."}

However, the success of popular SSL methods has limited on single-centric-object images like those in ImageNet and ignores the correlation among the scene and instances, as well as the semantic difference of instances in the scene. To address the above problems, we propose a Unified Self-supervised Visual Pre-training (UniVIP), a novel self-supervised framework to learn versatile visual representations on either single-centric-object or non-iconic dataset. The framework takes into account the representation learning at three levels: 1) the similarity of scene-scene, 2) the correlation of scene-instance, 3) the discrimination of instance-instance. During the learning, we adopt the optimal transport algorithm to automatically measure the discrimination of instances. Massive experiments show that UniVIP pre-trained on non-iconic COCO achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as image classification, semi-supervised learning, object detection and segmentation. Furthermore, our method can also exploit single-centric-object dataset such as ImageNet and outperforms BYOL by 2.5% with the same pre-training epochs in linear probing, and surpass current self-supervised object detection methods on COCO dataset, demonstrating its universality and potential."}

It relies on a small set of training objects to learn local object representations, which allow us to locally match the input image to a set of \"templates\", rendered images of the CAD models for the new objects. In contrast with the state-of-the-art methods, the new objects on which our method is applied can be very different from the training objects. As a result, we are the first to show generalization without retraining on the LINEMOD and Occlusion-LINEMOD datasets. Our analysis of the failure modes of previous template-based approaches further confirms the benefits of local features for template matching.

We propose a new unknown-aware object detection framework through Spatial-Temporal Unknown Distillation (STUD), which distills unknown objects from videos in the wild and meaningfully regularizes the model's decision boundary. STUD first identifies the unknown candidate object proposals in the spatial dimension, and then aggregates the candidates across multiple video frames to form a diverse set of unknown objects near the decision boundary. Alongside, we employ an energy-based uncertainty regularization loss, which contrastively shapes the uncertainty space between the in-distribution and distilled unknown objects. STUD establishes the state-of-the-art performance on OOD detection tasks for object detection, reducing the FPR95 score by over 10% compared to the previous best method."}

Our model can effectively leverage its experience from one source task and apply it to multiple target tasks (e.g., ObjectNav, RoomNav, ViewNav) with various goal modalities (e.g., image, sketch, audio, label). Furthermore, our model enables zero-shot experience learning, whereby it can solve the target tasks without receiving any task-specific interactive training.

In this paper, we propose Contrastive learning for Class-agnostic Activation Map (C^2AM) generation only using unlabeled image data, without the involvement of image-level supervision. The core idea comes from the observation that i) semantic information of foreground objects usually differs from their backgrounds; ii) foreground objects with similar appearance or background with similar color/texture have similar representations in the feature space. We form the positive and negative pairs based on the above relations and force the network to disentangle foreground and background with a class-agnostic activation map using a novel contrastive loss. As the network is guided to discriminate cross-image foreground-background, the class-agnostic activation maps learned by our approach generate more complete object regions. We successfully extracted from C^2AM class-agnostic object bounding boxes for object localization and background cues to refine CAM generated by classification network for semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, ImageNet-1K, and PASCAL VOC2012 datasets show that both WSOL and WSSS can benefit from the proposed C^2AM."}

Most self-attention neural networks employ pairwise dot-products to specify the attention coefficients. However, these methods require O(N^2) computing cost for sequence length N. Even though some approximation methods have been introduced to relieve the quadratic cost, the performance of the dot-product approach is still bottlenecked by the low-rank constraint in the attention matrix factorization. In this paper, we propose a novel scalable and effective mixing building block called Paramixer. Our method factorizes the interaction matrix into several sparse matrices, where we parameterize the non-zero entries by MLPs with the data elements as input. The overall computing cost of the new building block is as low as O(N \\log N). Moreover, all factorizing matrices in Paramixer are full-rank, so it does not suffer from the low-rank bottleneck. We have tested the new method on both synthetic and various real-world long sequential data sets and compared it with several state-of-the-art attention networks. The experimental results show that Paramixer has better performance in most learning tasks."}

The fear-to-sketch problem (i.e., \"I can't sketch\") has however proven to be fatal for its widespread adoption. This paper tackles this \"fear\" head on, and for the first time, proposes an auxiliary module for existing retrieval models that predominantly lets the users sketch without having to worry. We first conducted a pilot study that revealed the secret lies in the existence of noisy strokes, but not so much of the \"I can't sketch\". We consequently design a stroke subset selector that detects noisy strokes, leaving only those which make a positive contribution towards successful retrieval. Our Reinforcement Learning based formulation quantifies the importance of each stroke present in a given subset, based on the extent to which that stroke contributes to retrieval. When combined with pre-trained retrieval models as a pre-processing module, we achieve a significant gain of 8%-10% over standard baselines and in turn report new state-of-the-art performance. Last but not least, we demonstrate the selector once trained, can also be used in a plug-and-play manner to empower various sketch applications in ways that were not previously possible."}

However, most of them require per-pixel correspondence-level supervision, which is difficult to acquire at scale and in high quality. In this paper, we propose to explicitly integrate two matching priors in a single loss in order to learn local descriptors without supervision. Given two images depicting the same scene, we extract pixel descriptors and build a correlation volume. The first prior enforces the local consistency of matches in this volume via a pyramidal structure iteratively constructed using a non-parametric module. The second prior exploits the fact that each descriptor should match with at most one descriptor from the other image. We combine our unsupervised loss with a standard self-supervised loss trained from synthetic image augmentations. Feature descriptors learned by the proposed approach outperform their fully- and self-supervised counterparts on various geometric benchmarks such as visual localization and image matching, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Existing methods alleviate performance drop via domain alignment in a shared space and assume that the mapping from the aligned space to the output is transferable. However, the novel content induced by viewpoint changes may nullify such a space for effective alignments, thus resulting in negative adaptation. Our method works without aligning any statistics of the images between the two domains. Instead, it utilizes a novel attention-based view transformation network trained only on color images to hallucinate the semantic images for the target. Despite the lack of supervision, the view transformation network can still generalize to semantic images thanks to the induced \"information transport\" bias. Furthermore, to resolve ambiguities in converting the semantic images to semantic labels, we treat the view transformation network as a functional representation of an unknown mapping implied by the color images and propose functional label hallucination to generate pseudo-labels with uncertainties in the target domains. Our method surpasses baselines built on state-of-the-art correspondence estimation and view synthesis methods.

Inspired by 2D flow estimation, recent methods employ deep neural networks to construct the cost volume for estimating accurate 3D flow. However, these methods are limited by the fact that it is difficult to define a search window on point clouds because of the irregular data structure. In this paper, we avoid this irregularity by a simple yet effective method. We decompose the problem into two interlaced stages, where the 3D flows are optimized point-wisely at the first stage and then globally regularized in a recurrent network at the second stage. Therefore, the recurrent network only receives the regular point-wise information as the input. In the experiments, we evaluate the proposed method on both the 3D scene flow estimation and the point cloud registration task. For 3D scene flow estimation, we make comparisons on the widely used FlyingThings3D and KITTI datasets.

We find this strategy neither optimal nor efficient. This paper proposes a novel image synthesis paradigm using a bidirectional transformer decoder, which we term MaskGIT. During training, MaskGIT learns to predict randomly masked tokens by attending to tokens in all directions. At inference time, the model begins with generating all tokens of an image simultaneously, and then refines the image iteratively conditioned on the previous generation. Our experiments demonstrate that MaskGIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art transformer model on the ImageNet dataset, and accelerates autoregressive decoding by up to 48x.

Regrettably, it faces low inference efficiency due to heavy attention layers. Recently, two-stream methods like CLIP and ALIGN with high inference efficiency have also shown promising performance, however, they only consider instance-level alignment between the two streams (thus there is still room for improvement). To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel COllaborative Two-Stream vision-language pre-training model termed COTS for image-text retrieval by enhancing cross-modal interaction. In addition to instance-level alignment via momentum contrastive learning, we leverage two extra levels of cross-modal interactions in our COTS: (1) Token-level interaction -- a masked vision-language modeling (MVLM) learning objective is devised without using a cross-stream network module, where variational autoencoder is imposed on the visual encoder to generate visual tokens for each image. (2) Task-level interaction -- a KL-alignment learning objective is devised between text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks, where the probability distribution per task is computed with the negative queues in momentum contrastive learning. Under a fair comparison setting, our COTS achieves the highest performance among all two-stream methods and comparable performance (but with 10,800x faster in inference) w.r.t. the latest single-stream methods.

Most of existing cross-modal retrieval approaches ignore the usage of scene text information and directly adding this information may lead to performance degradation in scene text free scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a full transformer architecture to unify these cross-modal retrieval scenarios in a single Vision and Scene Text Aggregation framework (ViSTA). Specifically, ViSTA utilizes transformer blocks to directly encode image patches and fuse scene text embedding to learn an aggregated visual representation for cross-modal retrieval. To tackle the modality missing problem of scene text, we propose a novel fusion token based transformer aggregation approach to exchange the necessary scene text information only through the fusion token and concentrate on the most important features in each modality. To further strengthen the visual modality, we develop dual contrastive learning losses to embed both image-text pairs and fusion-text pairs into a common cross-modal space. Compared to existing methods, ViSTA enables to aggregate relevant scene text semantics with visual appearance, and hence improve results under both scene text free and scene text aware scenarios. Experimental results show that ViSTA outperforms other methods by at least 8.4% at Recall@1 for scene text aware retrieval task. Compared with state-of-the-art scene text free retrieval methods, ViSTA can achieve better accuracy on Flicker30K and MSCOCO while running at least three times faster during the inference stage, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework."}

Benefiting from a broader source of supervision, this new paradigm exhibits impressive transferability to downstream classification tasks and datasets. However, the problem of transferring the knowledge learned from image-text pairs to more complex dense prediction tasks has barely been visited. In this work, we present a new framework for dense prediction by implicitly and explicitly leveraging the pre-trained knowledge from CLIP. To this end, we convert the original image-text matching problem in CLIP to a pixel-text matching problem and use the pixel-text score maps to guide the learning of dense prediction models. By further using the contextual information from the image to prompt the language model, we are able to facilitate our model to better exploit the pre-trained knowledge. Our method is model-agnostic, which can be applied to arbitrary dense prediction systems and various pre-trained visual backbones including both CLIP models and ImageNet pre-trained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our methods on semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks."}

However, learning to recognise human actions and their social interactions in an unconstrained real-world environment comprising numerous people, with potentially highly unbalanced and long-tailed distributed action labels from a stream of sensory data captured from a mobile robot platform remains a significant challenge, not least owing to the lack of a reflective large-scale dataset. In this paper, we introduce JRDB-Act, as an extension of the existing JRDB, which is captured by a social mobile manipulator and reflects a real distribution of human daily-life actions in a university campus environment. JRDB-Act has been densely annotated with atomic actions, comprises over 2.8M action labels, constituting a large-scale spatio-temporal action detection dataset. Each human bounding box is labeled with one pose-based action label and multiple (optional) interaction-based action labels. Moreover JRDB-Act provides social group annotation, conducive to the task of grouping individuals based on their interactions in the scene to infer their social activities (common activities in each social group). Each annotated label in JRDB-Act is tagged with the annotators' confidence level which contributes to the development of reliable evaluation strategies. In order to demonstrate how one can effectively utilise such annotations, we develop an end-to-end trainable pipeline to learn and infer these tasks, i.e. individual action and social group detection. The data and the evaluation code will be publicly available at https://jrdb.erc.monash.edu/."}

A successful approach involves a viewpoint-aware approach that learns an image distribution based on generative models (e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs)) while generating various view images based on 3D-aware models (e.g., neural radiance fields (NeRFs)). However, they require images with various views for training, and consequently, their application to datasets with few or limited viewpoints remains a challenge. As a complementary approach, an aperture rendering GAN (AR-GAN) that employs a defocus cue was proposed. However, an AR-GAN is a CNN-based model and represents a defocus independently from a viewpoint change despite its high correlation, which is one of the reasons for its performance. As an alternative to an AR-GAN, we propose an aperture rendering NeRF (AR-NeRF), which can utilize viewpoint and defocus cues in a unified manner by representing both factors in a common ray-tracing framework. Moreover, to learn defocus-aware and defocus-independent representations in a disentangled manner, we propose aperture randomized training, for which we learn to generate images while randomizing the aperture size and latent codes independently. During our experiments, we applied AR-NeRF to various natural image datasets, including flower, bird, and face images, the results of which demonstrate the utility of AR-NeRF for unsupervised learning of the depth and defocus effects."}

A recent trend indicates that dynamic architectures based on an expansion of the parameters can reduce catastrophic forgetting efficiently in continual learning. However, existing approaches often require a task identifier at test-time, need complex tuning to balance the growing number of parameters, and barely share any information across tasks. As a result, they struggle to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead. In this paper, we propose a transformer architecture based on a dedicated encoder/decoder framework. Critically, the encoder and decoder are shared among all tasks. Through a dynamic expansion of special tokens, we specialize each forward of our decoder network on a task distribution. Our strategy scales to a large number of tasks while having negligible memory and time overheads due to strict control of the parameters expansion. Moreover, this efficient strategy doesn't need any hyperparameter tuning to control the network's expansion. Our model reaches excellent results on CIFAR100 and state-of-the-art performances on the large-scale ImageNet100 and ImageNet1000 while having less parameters than concurrent dynamic frameworks."}

Yet, the current paradigm suffers from two shortcomings: brittle under distribution shifts and inefficient for knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose to address these challenges from a causal representation perspective. We first introduce a causal formalism of motion forecasting, which casts the problem as a dynamic process with three groups of latent variables, namely invariant variables, style confounders, and spurious features. We then introduce a learning framework that treats each group separately: (i) unlike the common practice mixing datasets collected from different locations, we exploit their subtle distinctions by means of an invariance loss encouraging the model to suppress spurious correlations; (ii) we devise a modular architecture that factorizes the representations of invariant mechanisms and style confounders to approximate a sparse causal graph; (iii) we introduce a style contrastive loss that not only enforces the structure of style representations but also serves as a self-supervisory signal for test-time refinement on the fly. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that our proposed method improves the robustness and reusability of learned motion representations, significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art motion forecasting models for out-of-distribution generalization and low-shot transfer."}

The result has been a crowded field -- many methods with substantially different implementations yield results that seem nearly identical on popular benchmarks, such as linear evaluation on ImageNet. However, a single result does not tell the whole story. In this paper, we compare methods using performance-based benchmarks such as linear evaluation, nearest neighbor classification, and clustering for several different datasets, demonstrating the lack of a clear frontrunner within the current state-of-the-art. In contrast to prior work that performs only supervised vs. unsupervised comparison, we compare several different unsupervised methods against each other. To enrich this comparison, we analyze embeddings with measurements such as uniformity, tolerance, and centered kernel alignment (CKA), and propose two new metrics of our own: nearest neighbor graph similarity and linear prediction overlap. We reveal through our analysis that in isolation, single popular methods should not be treated as though they represent the field as a whole, and that future work ought to consider how to leverage the complimentary nature of these methods. We also leverage CKA to provide a framework to robustly quantify augmentation invariance, and provide a reminder that certain types of invariance will be undesirable for downstream tasks."}

An input image of vision MLP is usually split into multiple tokens (patches), while the existing MLP models directly aggregate them with fixed weights, neglecting the varying semantic information of tokens from different images. To dynamically aggregate tokens, we propose to represent each token as a wave function with two parts, amplitude and phase. Amplitude is the original feature and the phase term is a complex value changing according to the semantic contents of input images. Introducing the phase term can dynamically modulate the relationship between tokens and fixed weights in MLP. Based on the wave-like token representation, we establish a novel Wave-MLP architecture for vision tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Wave-MLP is superior to the state-of-the-art MLP architectures on various vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation.

One popular approach for physical-world attacks is to adopt the \"sticker-pasting\" strategy, which however suffers from some limitations, including difficulties in access to the target or printing by valid color. A new type of non-invasive attacks emerged recently, which attempt to cast perturbation onto the target by optics based tools, such as laser beam and projector. However, the added optical patterns are artificial but not natural. Thus, they are still conspicuous and attention-grabbed, and can be easily noticed by humans. In this paper, we study a new type of optical adversarial examples, in which the perturbations are generated by a very common natural phenomenon, shadow, to achieve naturalistic and stealthy physical-world adversarial attack under the black-box setting. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of this new attack on both simulated and real-world environments. Experimental results on traffic sign recognition demonstrate that our algorithm can generate adversarial examples effectively, reaching 98.23% and 90.47% success rates on LISA and GTSRB test sets respectively, while continuously misleading a moving camera over 95% of the time in real-world scenarios. We also offer discussions about the limitations and the defense mechanism of this attack."}

Style transfer and single-image 3D photography as two representative tasks have so far evolved independently. In this paper, we make a connection between the two, and address the challenging task of 3D photo stylization - generating stylized novel views from a single image given an arbitrary style. Our key intuition is that style transfer and view synthesis have to be jointly modeled. To this end, we propose a deep model that learns geometry-aware content features for stylization from a point cloud representation of the scene, resulting in high-quality stylized images that are consistent across views. Further, we introduce a novel training protocol to enable the learning using only 2D images. We demonstrate the superiority of our method via extensive qualitative and quantitative studies, and showcase key applications of our method in light of the growing demand for 3D content creation from 2D image assets."}

However, MRI suffers from very long acquisition times that make it susceptible to patient motion artifacts and limit its potential to deliver dynamic treatments. Conventional approaches such as Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing allow for an increase in MRI acquisition speed by reconstructing MR images from sub-sampled MRI data acquired using multiple receiver coils. Recent advancements in Deep Learning combined with Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing techniques have the potential to produce high-fidelity reconstructions from highly accelerated MRI data. In this work we present a novel Deep Learning-based Inverse Problem solver applied to the task of Accelerated MRI Reconstruction, called the Recurrent Variational Network (RecurrentVarNet), by exploiting the properties of Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks and unrolled algorithms for solving Inverse Problems. The RecurrentVarNet consists of multiple recurrent blocks, each responsible for one iteration of the unrolled variational optimization scheme for solving the inverse problem of multi-coil Accelerated MRI Reconstruction. Contrary to traditional approaches, the optimization steps are performed in the observation domain (k-space) instead of the image domain. Each block of the RecurrentVarNet refines the observed k-space and comprises a data consistency term and a recurrent unit which takes as input a learned hidden state and the prediction of the previous block. Our proposed method achieves new state of the art qualitative and quantitative reconstruction results on 5-fold and 10-fold accelerated data from a public multi-coil brain dataset, outperforming previous conventional and deep learning-based approaches.

However, it is difficult to directly leverage such large amounts of unlabeled and highly diverse data for complex 3D reasoning and planning tasks. Consequently, researchers have primarily focused on its use for various auxiliary pixel- and image-level computer vision tasks that do not consider an ultimate navigational objective. In this work, we introduce SelfD, a framework for learning scalable driving by utilizing large amounts of online monocular images. Our key idea is to leverage iterative semi-supervised training when learning imitative agents from unlabeled data. To handle unconstrained viewpoints, scenes, and camera parameters, we train an image-based model that directly learns to plan in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. Next, we use unlabeled data to augment the decision-making knowledge and robustness of an initially trained model via self-training. In particular, we propose a pseudo-labeling step which enables making full use of highly diverse demonstration data through \"hypothetical\" planning-based data augmentation. We employ a large dataset of publicly available YouTube videos to train SelfD and comprehensively analyze its generalization benefits across challenging navigation scenarios. Without requiring any additional data collection or annotation efforts, SelfD demonstrates consistent improvements (by up to 24%) in driving performance evaluation on nuScenes, Argoverse, Waymo, and CARLA."}

USG is the most common diagnostic modality for GB diseases due to its low cost and accessibility. However, USG images are challenging to analyze due to low image quality, noise, and varying viewpoints due to the handheld nature of the sensor. Our exhaustive study of state-of-the-art (SOTA) image classification techniques for the problem reveals that they often fail to learn the salient GB region due to the presence of shadows in the USG images. SOTA object detection techniques also achieve low accuracy because of spurious textures due to noise or adjacent organs. We propose GBCNet to tackle the challenges in our problem. GBCNet first extracts the regions of interest (ROIs) by detecting the GB (and not the cancer), and then uses a new multi-scale, second-order pooling architecture specializing in classifying GBC. To effectively handle spurious textures, we propose a curriculum inspired by human visual acuity, which reduces the texture biases in GBCNet. Experimental results demonstrate that GBCNet significantly outperforms SOTA CNN models, as well as the expert radiologists. Our technical innovations are generic to other USG image analysis tasks as well. Hence, as a validation, we also show the efficacy of GBCNet in detecting breast cancer from USG images.

Our study leads us to a new method, capable of connecting modality-specific advantages from polarisation, Time-of-Flight and structured-light inputs. We propose a novel pipeline capable of estimating depth from monocular polarisation for which we evaluate various training signals. The inversion of differentiable analytic models thereby connects scene geometry with polarisation and ToF signals and enables self-supervised and cross-modal learning. In the absence of existing multimodal datasets, we examine our approach with a custom-made multi-modal camera rig and collect CroMo; the first dataset to consist of synchronized stereo polarisation, indirect ToF and structured-light depth, captured at video rates. Extensive experiments on challenging video scenes confirm both qualitative and quantitative pipeline advantages where we are able to outperform competitive monocular depth estimation methods."}

Our goal is to train a model with a 'unified' architecture and only one set of pretrained weights that can tackle multiple types of adverse weathers such as haze, snow, and rain simultaneously. To this end, a two-stage knowledge learning mechanism including knowledge collation (KC) and knowledge examination (KE) based on a multi-teacher and student architecture is proposed. At the KC, the student network aims to learn the comprehensive bad weather removal problem from multiple well-trained teacher networks where each of them is specialized in a specific bad weather removal problem. To accomplish this process, a novel collaborative knowledge transfer is proposed. At the KE, the student model is trained without the teacher networks and examined by challenging pixel loss derived by the ground truth. Moreover, to improve the performance of our training framework, a novel loss function called multi-contrastive knowledge regularization (MCR) loss is proposed. Experiments on several datasets show that our student model can achieve promising performance on different bad weather removal tasks simultaneously."}

We propose Polymorphic-GAN which learns shared features across all domains and a per-domain morph layer to morph shared features according to each domain. In contrast to previous works, our framework allows simultaneous modelling of images with highly varying geometries, such as images of human faces, painted and artistic faces, as well as multiple different animal faces. We demonstrate that our model produces aligned samples for all domains and show how it can be used for applications such as segmentation transfer and cross-domain image editing, as well as training in low-data regimes. Additionally, we apply our Polymorphic-GAN on image-to-image translation tasks and show that we can greatly surpass previous approaches in cases where the geometric differences between domains are large."}

Especially with cross-modal tasks between image and text, vector quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are widely used to make a raw RGB image into a sequence of feature vectors. To better leverage the correlation between image and text, we propose L-Verse, a novel architecture consisting of feature-augmented variational autoencoder (AugVAE) and bidirectional auto-regressive transformer (BiART) for image-to-text and text-to-image generation. Our AugVAE shows the state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on ImageNet1K validation set, along with the robustness to unseen images in the wild. Unlike other models, BiART can distinguish between image (or text) as a conditional reference and a generation target. L-Verse can be directly used for image-to-text or text-to-image generation without any finetuning or extra object detection framework. In quantitative and qualitative experiments, L-Verse shows impressive results against previous methods in both image-to-text and text-to-image generation on MS-COCO Captions.

Prior works address this problem by simply adding a dense depth regression head to panoptic segmentation (PS) networks, resulting in two independent task branches. This neglects the mutually-beneficial relations between these two tasks, thus failing to exploit handy instance-level semantic cues to boost depth accuracy while also producing sub-optimal depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified framework for the DPS task by applying a dynamic convolution technique to both the PS and depth prediction tasks. Specifically, instead of predicting depth for all pixels at a time, we generate instance-specific kernels to predict depth and segmentation masks for each instance. Moreover, leveraging the instance-wise depth estimation scheme, we add additional instance-level depth cues to assist with supervising the depth learning via a new depth loss. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes-DPS and SemKITTI-DPS show the effectiveness and promise of our method. We hope our unified solution to DPS can lead a new paradigm in this area."}

Specifically, the OpenTAL consists of uncertainty-aware action classification, actionness prediction, and temporal location regression. With the proposed importance-balanced EDL method, classification uncertainty is learned by collecting categorical evidence majorly from important samples. To distinguish the unknown actions from background video frames, the actionness is learned by the positive-unlabeled learning. The classification uncertainty is further calibrated by leveraging the guidance from the temporal localization quality. The OpenTAL is general to enable existing TAL models for open set scenarios, and experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method.

However, the problem remains challenging when one tries to generalize the detector to forgeries created by unseen methods in the training dataset. This work addresses the generalizable deepfake detection from a simple principle: a generalizable representation should be sensitive to diverse types of forgeries. Following this principle, we propose to enrich the \"diversity\" of forgeries by synthesizing augmented forgeries with a pool of forgery configurations and strengthen the \"sensitivity\" to the forgeries by enforcing the model to predict the forgery configurations. To effectively explore the large forgery augmentation space, we further propose to use the adversarial training strategy to dynamically synthesize the most challenging forgeries to the current model.

In this paper, we propose Upright-Net, a deep-learning-based approach for estimating the upright orientation of 3D point clouds. Based on a well-known postulate of design states that \"form ever follows function\", we treat the natural base of an object as a common functional structure, which supports the object in a most commonly seen pose following a set of specific rules, e.g. physical laws, functionality-related geometric properties, semantic cues, and so on. Thus we apply a data-driven deep learning method to automatically encode those rules and formulate the upright orientation estimation problem as a classification model, i.e. extract the points on a 3D model that forms the natural base. And then the upright orientation is computed as the normal of the natural base. Our proposed new approach has three advantages. First, it formulates the continuous orientation estimation task as a discrete classification task while preserving the continuity of the solution space. Second, it automatically learns the comprehensive criteria defining a natural base of general 3D models even with asymmetric geometry. Third, the learned orientation-aware features can serve well in downstream tasks. Results show that our approach outperforms previous approaches on orientation estimation and also achieves remarkable generalization capability and transfer capability."}

Specifically, HybridCR is the first framework to leverage both point consistency and employ contrastive regularization with pseudo labeling in an end-to-end manner. Fundamentally, HybridCR explicitly and effectively considers the semantic similarity between local neighboring points and global characteristics of 3D classes. We further design a dynamic point cloud augmentor to generate diversity and robust sample views, whose transformation parameter is jointly optimized with model training.

The few existing works contain splits with imbalanced class distributions over the tasks, or study the problem in unsuitable datasets. We introduce vCLIMB, a novel video continual learning benchmark. vCLIMB is a standardized test-bed to analyze catastrophic forgetting of deep models in video continual learning. In contrast to previous work, we focus on class incremental continual learning with models trained on a sequence of disjoint tasks, and distribute the number of classes uniformly across the tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations of existing CL methods in vCLIMB, and observe two unique challenges in video data. The selection of instances to store in episodic memory is performed at the frame level. Second, untrimmed training data influences the effectiveness of frame sampling strategies. We address these two challenges by proposing a temporal consistency regularization that can be applied on top of memory-based continual learning methods. Our approach significantly improves the baseline, by up to 24% on the untrimmed continual learning task. The code of our benchmark can be found at: https://vclimb.netlify.app/."}

To unfold this potential in the form of robust panoramic segmentation models, large quantities of expensive, pixel-wise annotations are crucial for success. Such annotations are available, but predominantly for narrow-angle, pinhole-camera images which, off the shelf, serve as sub-optimal resources for training panoramic models. Distortions and the distinct image-feature distribution in 360deg panoramas impede the transfer from the annotation-rich pinhole domain and therefore come with a big dent in performance. To get around this domain difference and bring together semantic annotations from pinhole- and 360deg surround-visuals, we propose to learn object deformations and panoramic image distortions in the Deformable Patch Embedding (DPE) and Deformable MLP (DMLP) components which blend into our Transformer for PAnoramic Semantic Segmentation (Trans4PASS) model. Finally, we tie together shared semantics in pinhole- and panoramic feature embeddings by generating multi-scale prototype features and aligning them in our Mutual Prototypical Adaptation (MPA) for unsupervised domain adaptation. On the indoor Stanford2D3D dataset, our Trans4PASS with MPA maintains comparable performance to fully-supervised state-of-the-arts, cutting the need for over 1,400 labeled panoramas. On the outdoor DensePASS dataset, we break state-of-the-art by 14.39% mIoU and set the new bar at 56.38%."}

However, most existing networks are trained with clean signals which are often hard or impossible to obtain. Equivariant imaging (EI) is a recent self-supervised learning framework that exploits the group invariance present in signal distributions to learn a reconstruction function from partial measurement data alone. While EI results are impressive, its performance degrades with increasing noise. In this paper, we propose a Robust Equivariant Imaging (REI) framework which can learn to image from noisy partial measurements alone. The proposed method uses Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to obtain a fully unsupervised training loss that is robust to noise. We show that REI leads to considerable performance gains on linear and nonlinear inverse problems, thereby paving the way for robust unsupervised imaging with deep networks.

Existing SGG methods trained on the entire set of relations fail to acquire complex reasoning about visual and textual correlations due to various biases in training data. Learning on trivial relations that indicate generic spatial configuration like 'on' instead of informative relations such as 'parked on' does not enforce this complex reasoning, harming generalization. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework for SGG training that exploits relation labels based on their informativeness. Our model-agnostic training procedure imputes missing informative relations for less informative samples in the training data and trains a SGG model on the imputed labels along with existing annotations. We show that this approach can successfully be used in conjunction with state-of-the-art SGG methods and improves their performance significantly in multiple metrics on the standard Visual Genome benchmark. Furthermore, we obtain considerable improvements for unseen triplets in a more challenging zero-shot setting."}

Benefiting from the incremental nature of RGB-D reconstruction, we only need to update the residuals between the reconstructed scenes of consecutive frames, which are usually sparse. For layer design, we define novel residual propagation rules for sparse convolution operations, achieving close approximation to standard sparse convolution. For network architecture, an uncertainty term is proposed to adaptively select which residual to update, further improving the inference accuracy and efficiency. Based on INS-Conv, an online joint 3D semantic and instance segmentation pipeline is proposed, reaching an inference speed of 15 FPS on GPU and 10 FPS on CPU. Experiments on ScanNetv2 and SceneNN datasets show that the accuracy of our method surpasses previous online methods by a large margin, and is on par with state-of-the-art offline methods.

In this work, we first construct a strong baseline of self-training (namely ST) for semi-supervised semantic segmentation via injecting strong data augmentations (SDA) on unlabeled images to alleviate overfitting noisy labels as well as decouple similar predictions between the teacher and student. With this simple mechanism, our ST outperforms all existing methods without any bells and whistles, e.g., iterative re-training. Inspired by the impressive results, we thoroughly investigate the SDA and provide some empirical analysis. Nevertheless, incorrect pseudo labels are still prone to accumulate and degrade the performance. To this end, we further propose an advanced self-training framework (namely ST++), that performs selective re-training via prioritizing reliable unlabeled images based on holistic prediction-level stability. Concretely, several model checkpoints are saved in the first stage supervised training, and the discrepancy of their predictions on the unlabeled image serves as a measurement for reliability. Our image-level selection offers holistic contextual information for learning. We demonstrate that it is more suitable for segmentation than common pixel-wise selection. As a result, ST++ further boosts the performance of our ST. Code is available at https://github.com/LiheYoung/ST-PlusPlus."}

We propose an approach that estimates heterogeneous material properties of an object from a monocular video of its surface vibrations. Specifically, we show how to estimate Young's modulus and density throughout a 3D object with known geometry. Knowledge of how these values change across the object is useful for simulating its motion and characterizing any defects. Traditional non-destructive testing approaches, which often require expensive instruments, generally estimate only homogenized material properties or simply identify the presence of defects. In contrast, our approach leverages monocular video to (1) identify image-space modes from an object's sub-pixel motion, and (2) directly infer spatially-varying Young's modulus and density values from the observed modes. We demonstrate our approach on both simulated and real videos."}

We construct a framework for semi-supervised instance segmentation by assigning pixel-level pseudo labels. Under this framework, we point out that noisy boundaries associated with pseudo labels are double-edged. We propose to exploit and resist them in a unified manner simultaneously: 1) To combat the negative effects of noisy boundaries, we propose a noise-tolerant mask head by leveraging low-resolution features. 2) To enhance the positive impacts, we introduce a boundary-preserving map for learning detailed information within boundary-relevant regions. We evaluate our approach by extensive experiments. It behaves extraordinarily, outperforming the supervised baseline by a large margin, more than 6% on Cityscapes, 7% on COCO and 4.5% on BDD100k. On Cityscapes, our method achieves comparable performance by utilizing only 30% labeled images."}

A-ViT achieves this by automatically reducing the number of tokens in vision transformers that are processed in the network as inference proceeds. We reformulate Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) for this task, extending halting to discard redundant spatial tokens. The appealing architectural properties of vision transformers enables our adaptive token reduction mechanism to speed up inference without modifying the network architecture or inference hardware. We demonstrate that A-ViT requires no extra parameters or sub-network for halting, as we base the learning of adaptive halting on the original network parameters. We further introduce distributional prior regularization that stabilizes training compared to prior ACT approaches. On the image classification task (ImageNet1K), we show that our proposed A-ViT yields high efficacy in filtering informative spatial features and cutting down on the overall compute.

We build a topological map on-the-fly to enable efficient exploration in global action space. To balance the complexity of large action space reasoning and fine-grained language grounding, we dynamically combine a fine-scale encoding over local observations and a coarse-scale encoding on a global map via graph transformers.

While ongoing research efforts are engaging these problems from various angles, in most computer vision related cases these approaches can be generalized to investigations of the effects of distribution shifts in image data. In this context, we propose to study the shifts in the learned weights of trained CNN models. Here we focus on the properties of the distributions of dominantly used 3x3 convolution filter kernels. We collected and publicly provide a dataset with over 1.4 billion filters from hundreds of trained CNNs, using a wide range of datasets, architectures, and vision tasks. In a first use case of the proposed dataset, we can show highly relevant properties of many publicly available pre-trained models for practical applications: I) We analyze distribution shifts (or the lack thereof) between trained filters along different axes of meta-parameters, like visual category of the dataset, task, architecture, or layer depth. Based on these results, we conclude that model pre-training can succeed on arbitrary datasets if they meet size and variance conditions. II) We show that many pre-trained models contain degenerated filters which make them less robust and less suitable for fine-tuning on target applications."}

Currently, most prediction methods do not enforce scene consistency, i.e., there are a substantial amount of self-collisions between predicted trajectories of different agents in the scene. Moreover, many approaches generate individual trajectory predictions per agent instead of joint trajectory predictions of the whole scene, which makes downstream planning difficult. In this work, we present ScePT, a policy planning-based trajectory prediction model that generates accurate, scene-consistent trajectory predictions suitable for autonomous system motion planning. It explicitly enforces scene consistency and learns an agent interaction policy that can be used for conditional prediction. Experiments on multiple real-world pedestrians and autonomous vehicle datasets show that ScePT matches current state-of-the-art prediction accuracy with significantly improved scene consistency. We also demonstrate ScePT's ability to work with a downstream contingency planner."}

With an overarching goal of developing intelligent systems to assist humans in various daily activities, we propose VisualHow, a free-form and open-ended research that focuses on understanding a real-life problem and deriving its solution by incorporating key components across multiple modalities.

However, it is quite difficult to sufficiently use them, due to large inter-modal discrepancies. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, namely Contrastively Augmented Transformer for multi-modal 3D object Detection (CAT-Det). Specifically, CAT-Det adopts a two-stream structure consisting of a Pointformer (PT) branch, an Imageformer (IT) branch along with a Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) module. PT, IT and CMT jointly encode intra-modal and inter-modal long-range contexts for representing an object, thus fully exploring multi-modal information for detection. Furthermore, we propose an effective One-way Multi-modal Data Augmentation (OMDA) approach via hierarchical contrastive learning at both the point and object levels, significantly improving the accuracy only by augmenting point-clouds, which is free from complex generation of paired samples of the two modalities.

Unlike the existing semi-supervised image generation task, where unlabeled data only contain closed-set samples, our task is more general and lowers the data collection cost in practice by allowing open-set samples to appear. Thanks to entropy regularization, the classifier that is trained on labeled data is able to quantify sample-wise importance to the training of cGAN as confidence, allowing us to use all samples in unlabeled data. We design OSSGAN, which provides decision clues to the discriminator on the basis of whether an unlabeled image belongs to one or none of the classes of interest, smoothly integrating labeled and unlabeled data during training.

Many existing methods rely on preconceived assumptions to bridge the missing spatial information in monocular images, and predict a sole depth value for every object of interest. However, these assumptions do not always hold in practical applications. To tackle this problem, we propose a depth solving system that fully explores the visual clues from the subtasks in M3OD and generates multiple estimations for the depth of each target. Since the depth estimations rely on different assumptions in essence, they present diverse distributions. Even if some assumptions collapse, the estimations established on the remaining assumptions are still reliable. In addition, we develop a depth selection and combination strategy. This strategy is able to remove abnormal estimations caused by collapsed assumptions, and adaptively combine the remaining estimations into a single one. In this way, our depth solving system becomes more precise and robust. Exploiting the clues from multiple subtasks of M3OD and without introducing any extra information, our method surpasses the current best method by more than 20% relatively on the Moderate level of test split in the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark, while still maintaining real-time efficiency."}

To address these issues, we present the first convolution-free model for referring image segmentation using transformers, dubbed ReSTR. Since it extracts features of both modalities through transformer encoders, it can capture long-range dependencies between entities within each modality. Also, ReSTR fuses features of the two modalities by a self-attention encoder, which enables flexible and adaptive interactions between the two modalities in the fusion process. The fused features are fed to a segmentation module, which works adaptively according to the image and language expression in hand.

We address this challenge by developing a flow-based generative model of the 3D human body from sparse observations, wherein we learn not only a conditional distribution of 3D human pose, but also a probabilistic mapping from observations to the latent space from which we can generate a plausible pose along with uncertainty estimates for the joints.

Most previous works adopt a bottom-up two-stage or a point-based one-stage approach, which often suffers from high time complexity or sub-optimal designs. In this work, we propose a novel SGG method to address the aforementioned issues, formulating the task as a bipartite graph construction problem. To solve the problem, we develop a transformer-based end-to-end framework that first generates the entity and predicate proposal set, followed by inferring directed edges to form the relation triplets. In particular, we develop a new entity-aware predicate representation based on a structural predicate generator that leverages the compositional property of relationships. Moreover, we design a graph assembling module to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph based on our entity-aware structure, enabling us to generate the scene graph in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results show that our design is able to achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two challenging benchmarks, surpassing most of the existing approaches and enjoying higher efficiency in inference. We hope our model can serve as a strong baseline for the Transformer-based scene graph generation. Code is available in https://github.com/Scarecrow0/SGTR"}

Each object is represented by a separate MLP that takes a position, direction, and time and outputs density and radiance. The background is represented by a similar MLP that also outputs semantics. Importantly, the object MLPs are specific to each instance and initialized with meta-learning, and thus can be smaller and faster than previous object-aware approaches, while still leveraging category-specific priors. We propose a system to infer the PanopticNeRF representation from a set of color images. We use off-the-shelf algorithms to predict camera poses, object bounding boxes, object categories, and 2D image semantic segmentations. Then we jointly optimize the MLP weights and bounding box parameters using analysis-by-synthesis with self-supervision from the color images and pseudo-supervision from predicted semantic segmentations. PanopticNeRF can be effectively used for multiple 2D and 3D tasks like 3D scene editing, 3D panoptic reconstruction, novel view and semantic synthesis, 2D panoptic segmentation, and multiview depth prediction. We demonstrate these applications on several difficult, dynamic scenes with moving objects."}

However, the throughput for most of them is less than 1 MB/s even with the most advanced AI accelerated chips, preventing them from most real-world applications, which often require 100 MB/s. In this paper, we propose PILC, an end-to-end image lossless compression framework that achieves 200 MB/s for both compression and decompression with a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, 10x faster than the most efficient one before. To obtain this result, we first develop an AI codec that combines auto-regressive model and VQ-VAE which performs well in lightweight setting, then we design a low complexity entropy coder that works well with our codec. Experiments show that our framework compresses better than PNG by a margin of 30% in multiple datasets. We believe this is an important step to bring AI compression forward to commercial use."}

While prevalent multi-modal methods simply decorate raw lidar point clouds with camera features and feed them directly to existing 3D detection models, our study shows that fusing camera features with deep lidar features instead of raw points, can lead to better performance. However, as those features are often augmented and aggregated, a key challenge in fusion is how to effectively align the transformed features from two modalities. In this paper, we propose two novel techniques: InverseAug that inverses geometric-related augmentations, e.g., rotation, to enable accurate geometric alignment between lidar points and image pixels, and LearnableAlign that leverages cross-attention to dynamically capture the correlations between image and lidar features during fusion. Based on InverseAug and LearnableAlign, we develop a family of generic multi-modal 3D detection models named DeepFusion, which is more accurate than previous methods. For example, DeepFusion improves PointPillars, CenterPoint, and 3D-MAN baselines on Pedestrian detection for 6.7, 8.9, and 6.2 LEVEL_2 APH, respectively. Notably, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance on Waymo Open Dataset, and show strong model robustness against input corruptions and out-of-distribution data.

A major challenge for CL systems is catastrophic forgetting, where earlier tasks are forgotten while learning a new task. To address this, replay-based CL approaches maintain and repeatedly retrain on a small buffer of data selected across encountered tasks. We propose Gradient Coreset Replay (GCR), a novel strategy for replay buffer selection and update using a carefully designed optimization criterion. Specifically, we select and maintain a 'coreset' that closely approximates the gradient of all the data seen so far with respect to current model parameters, and discuss key strategies needed for its effective application to the continual learning setting. We show significant gains (2%-4% absolute) over the state-of-the-art in the well-studied offline continual learning setting. Our findings also effectively transfer to online / streaming CL settings, showing up to 5% gains over existing approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the value of supervised contrastive loss for continual learning, which yields a cumulative gain of up to 5% accuracy when combined with our subset selection strategy."}

However, it remains under explored that whether CLIP, pre-trained by large-scale image-text pairs in 2D, can be generalized to 3D recognition. In this paper, we identify such a setting is feasible by proposing PointCLIP, which conducts alignment between CLIP-encoded point cloud and 3D category texts. Specifically, we encode a point cloud by projecting it into multi-view depth maps without rendering, and aggregate the view-wise zero-shot prediction to achieve knowledge transfer from 2D to 3D. On top of that, we design an inter-view adapter to better extract the global feature and adaptively fuse the few-shot knowledge learned from 3D into CLIP pre-trained in 2D. By just fine-tuning the lightweight adapter in the few-shot settings, the performance of PointCLIP could be largely improved. In addition, we observe the complementary property between PointCLIP and classical 3D-supervised networks. By simple ensembling, PointCLIP boosts baseline's performance and even surpasses state-of-the-art models. Therefore, PointCLIP is a promising alternative for effective 3D point cloud understanding via CLIP under low resource cost and data regime. We conduct thorough experiments on widely-adopted ModelNet10, ModelNet40 and the challenging ScanObjectNN to demonstrate the effectiveness of PointCLIP."}

In contrast, classical 3D reconstruction methods can handle large-scale scenes but do not produce realistic renderings. We propose NeRFusion, a method that combines the advantages of NeRF and TSDF-based fusion techniques to achieve efficient large-scale reconstruction and photo-realistic rendering. We process the input image sequence to predict per-frame local radiance fields via direct network inference. These are then fused using a novel recurrent neural network that incrementally reconstructs a global, sparse scene representation in real-time. This global volume can be further fine-tuned to boost rendering quality. We demonstrate that NeRFusion achieves state-of-the-art quality on both large-scale indoor and small-scale object scenes, with substantially faster reconstruction than NeRF and other recent methods."}

State-of-the-art FI approaches compare two images by taking the cosine similarity between their image embeddings. Yet, such approach suffers from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to new types of images (e.g., when a query face is masked, cropped or rotated) not included in the training set or the gallery. Here, we propose a re-ranking approach that compares two faces using the Earth Mover's Distance on the deep, spatial features of image patches. Our extra comparison stage explicitly examines image similarity at a fine-grained level (e.g., eyes to eyes) and is more robust to OOD perturbations and occlusions than traditional FI. Interestingly, without finetuning feature extractors, our method consistently improves the accuracy on all tested OOD queries: masked, cropped, rotated, and adversarial while obtaining similar results on in-distribution images."}

The resulting training method shares its algorithmic simplicity with several existing approaches to train BiNNs, in particular with the straight-through gradient estimator successfully employed in BinaryConnect and subsequent methods.

Existing adversarial UDA methods typically adopt an additional discriminator to play the min-max game with a feature extractor. However, most of these methods failed to effectively leverage the predicted discriminative information, and thus cause mode collapse for generator. In this work, we address this problem from a different perspective and design a simple yet effective adversarial paradigm in the form of a discriminator-free adversarial learning network (DALN), wherein the category classifier is reused as a discriminator, which achieves explicit domain alignment and category distinguishment through a unified objective, enabling the DALN to leverage the predicted discriminative information for sufficient feature alignment. Basically, we introduce a Nuclear-norm Wasserstein discrepancy (NWD) that has definite guidance meaning for performing discrimination. Such NWD can be coupled with the classifier to serve as a discriminator satisfying the K-Lipschitz constraint without the requirements of additional weight clipping or gradient penalty strategy. Without bells and whistles, DALN compares favorably against the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on a variety of public datasets. Moreover, as a plug-and-play technique, NWD can be directly used as a generic regularizer to benefit existing UDA algorithms. Code is available at https://github.com/xiaoachen98/DALN."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2022", "Area": "CV", "Where": "CVPR", "Abbreviation": "Pooling Revisited", "Title": "Your Receptive Field Is Suboptimal", "Abstract": "The size and shape of the receptive field determine how the network aggregates local features, and affect the overall performance of a model considerably. Many components in a neural network, such as depth, kernel sizes, and strides for convolution and pooling, influence the receptive field. However, they still rely on hyperparameters, and the receptive fields of existing models result in suboptimal shapes and sizes. Hence, we propose a simple yet effective Dynamically Optimized Pooling operation, referred to as DynOPool, which learns the optimized scale factors of feature maps end-to-end. Moreover, DynOPool determines the proper resolution of a feature map by learning the desirable size and shape of its receptive field, which allows an operator in a deeper layer to observe an input image in the optimal scale. Any kind of resizing modules in a deep neural network can be replaced by DynOPool with minimal cost. Also, DynOPool controls the complexity of the model by introducing an additional loss term that constrains computational cost. Our experiments show that the models equipped with the proposed learnable resizing module outperform the baseline algorithms on multiple datasets in image classification and semantic segmentation."}

This comes with major limitations. For example, it is problematic for a model conditioned on an image to generate a specific motion trajectory desired by the user since there is no means to provide motion information. Conversely, language information can describe the desired motion, while not precisely defining the content of the video. This work presents a multimodal video generation framework that benefits from text and images provided jointly or separately. We leverage the recent progress in quantized representations for videos and apply a bidirectional transformer with multiple modalities as inputs to predict a discrete video representation. To improve video quality and consistency, we propose a new video token trained with self-learning and an improved mask-prediction algorithm for sampling video tokens. We introduce text augmentation to improve the robustness of the textual representation and diversity of generated videos. Our framework can incorporate various visual modalities, such as segmentation masks, drawings, and partially occluded images. It can generate much longer sequences than the one used for training. In addition, our model can extract visual information as suggested by the text prompt, e.g., \"an object in image one is moving northeast\", and generate corresponding videos. We run evaluations on three public datasets and a newly collected dataset labeled with facial attributes, achieving state-of-the-art generation results on all four.

It iteratively moves each data point to the weighted mean of its neighborhood data points. The computational cost required for finding neighborhood data points for each one is quadratic to the number of data points. Therefore, it is very slow for large-scale datasets. To address this issue, we propose a mode-seeking algorithm, GridShift, with faster computing and principally based on MeanShift that uses a grid-based approach. To speed up, GridShift employs a grid-based approach for neighbor search, which is linear to the number of data points. In addition, GridShift moves the active grid cells (grid cells associated with at least one data point) in place of data points towards the higher density, which provides more speed up. The runtime of GridShift is linear to the number of active grid cells and exponential to the number of features. Therefore, it is ideal for large-scale low-dimensional applications such as object tracking and image segmentation. Through extensive experiments, we showcase the superior performance of GridShift compared to other MeanShift-based algorithms and state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and runtime on benchmark datasets, image segmentation. Finally, we provide a new object-tracking algorithm based on GridShift and show promising results for object tracking compared to camshift and MeanShift++."}

We challenge those NMS-based methods from three aspects: 1) The bounding box with highest confidence value may not be the true positive having the biggest overlap with the ground-truth box. 2) Not only suppression is required for redundant boxes, but also confidence enhancement is needed for those true positives. 3) Sorting candidate boxes by confidence values is not necessary so that full parallelism is achievable. In this paper, inspired by belief propagation (BP), we propose the Confidence Propagation Cluster (CP-Cluster) to replace NMS-based methods, which is fully parallelizable as well as better in accuracy. In CP-Cluster, we borrow the message passing mechanism from BP to penalize redundant boxes and enhance true positives simultaneously in an iterative way until convergence. We verified the effectiveness of CP-Cluster by applying it to various mainstream detectors such as FasterRCNN, SSD, FCOS, YOLOv3, YOLOv5, Centernet etc. Experiments on MS COCO show that our plug and play method, without retraining detectors, is able to steadily improve average mAP of all those state-of-theart models with a clear margin from 0.3 to 1.9 respectively when compared with NMS-based methods."}

Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and low contrast, infrared targets are easily submerged in the background of heavy noise and clutter. How to detect the precise shape information of infrared targets remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel infrared shape network (ISNet), where Taylor finite difference (TFD)-inspired edge block and two-orientation attention aggregation (TOAA) block are devised to address this problem. Specifically, TFD-inspired edge block aggregates and enhances the comprehensive edge information from different levels, in order to improve the contrast between target and background and also lay a foundation for extracting shape information with mathematical interpretation. TOAA block calculates the low-level information with attention mechanism in both row and column directions and fuses it with the high-level information to capture the shape characteristic of targets and suppress noises. In addition, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 1,000 realistic images in various target shapes, different target sizes, and rich clutter backgrounds with accurate pixel-level annotations, called IRSTD-1k. Experiments on public datasets and IRSTD-1k demonstrate the superiority of our approach over representative state-of-the-art IRSTD methods.

Prevailing 3D reconstruction algorithms often adopt the image matching paradigm and presume that a portion of the scene is co-visible across images, yielding poor performance when there is little overlap among inputs. In contrast, humans can associate visible parts in one image to the corresponding invisible components in another image via prior knowledge of the shapes. Inspired by this fact, we present a novel concept called virtual correspondences (VCs). VCs are a pair of pixels from two images whose camera rays intersect in 3D. Similar to classic correspondences, VCs conform with epipolar geometry; unlike classic correspondences, VCs do not need to be co-visible across views. Therefore VCs can be established and exploited even if images do not overlap. We introduce a method to find virtual correspondences based on humans in the scene. We showcase how VCs can be seamlessly integrated with classic bundle adjustment to recover camera poses across extreme views. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose estimation methods in challenging scenarios and is comparable in the traditional densely captured setup. Our approach also unleashes the potential of multiple downstream tasks such as scene reconstruction from multi-view stereo and novel view synthesis in extreme-view scenarios."}

Existing methods mainly leverage a single-stage detection fashion, while neglecting small objects with low-resolution fine edges requires more operations than the larger ones. To tackle camouflaged object detection (COD), we are inspired by humans attention coupled with the coarse-to-fine detection strategy, and thereby propose an iterative refinement framework, coined SegMaR, which integrates Segment, Magnify and Reiterate in a multi-stage detection fashion. Specifically, we design a new discriminative mask which makes the model attend on the fixation and edge regions. In addition, we leverage an attention-based sampler to magnify the object region progressively with no need of enlarging the image size. Extensive experiments show our SegMaR achieves remarkable and consistent improvements over other state-of-the-art methods. Especially, we surpass two competitive methods 7.4% and 20.0% respectively in average over standard evaluation metrics on small camouflaged objects. Additional studies provide more promising insights into SegMaR, including its effectiveness on the discriminative mask and its generalization to other network architectures."}

The task of automated panoptic symbol spotting, i.e., to spot and parse both countable object instances (windows, doors, tables, etc.) and uncountable stuff (wall, railing, etc.) from CAD drawings, has recently drawn interests from the computer vision community. Unfortunately, the highly irregular ordering and orientations set major roadblocks for this task. Existing methods, based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and/or graph neural networks (GNNs), regress instance bounding boxes in the pixel domain and then convert the predictions into symbols. In this paper, we present a novel framework named CADTransformer, that can painlessly modify existing vision transformer (ViT) backbones to tackle the above limitations for the panoptic symbol spotting task. CADTransformer tokenizes directly from the set of graphical primitives in CAD drawings, and correspondingly optimizes line-grained semantic and instance symbol spotting altogether by a pair of prediction heads. The backbone is further enhanced with a few plug-and-play modifications, including a neighborhood aware self-attention, hierarchical feature aggregation, and graphic entity position encoding, to bake in the structure prior while optimizing the efficiency. Besides, a new data augmentation method, termed Random Layer, is proposed by the layer-wise separation and recombination of a CAD drawing. Overall, CADTransformer significantly boosts the previous state-of-the-art from 0.595 to 0.685 in the panoptic quality (PQ) metric, on the recently released FloorPlanCAD dataset.

In this paper, we observe an interesting phenomenon of intra-class heterogeneity in real data and show that existing methods fail to retain this property in their synthetic images, which causes a limited performance increase. To address this issue, we propose a novel zero-shot quantization method referred to as IntraQ. First, we propose a local object reinforcement that locates the target objects at different scales and positions of the synthetic images. Second, we introduce a marginal distance constraint to form class-related features distributed in a coarse area. Lastly, we devise a soft inception loss which injects a soft prior label to prevent the synthetic images from being overfitting to a fixed object. Our IntraQ is demonstrated to well retain the intra-class heterogeneity in the synthetic images and also observed to perform state-of-the-art. For example, compared to the advanced ZSQ, our IntraQ obtains 9.17% increase of the top-1 accuracy on ImageNet when all layers of MobileNetV1 are quantized to 4-bit.

Although the demand for these tools is high, the prior knowledge required makes it difficult for novices to get started. Systems that could follow natural language instructions to perform automatic editing would significantly improve accessibility. This paper introduces the language-based video editing (LBVE) task, which allows the model to edit, guided by text instruction, a source video into a target video. LBVE contains two features: 1) the scenario of the source video is preserved instead of generating a completely different video; 2) the semantic is presented differently in the target video, and all changes are controlled by the given instruction. We propose a Multi-Modal Multi-Level Transformer (M3L-Transformer) to carry out LBVE. The M3L-Transformer dynamically learns the correspondence between video perception and language semantic at different levels, which benefits both the video understanding and video frame synthesis. We build three new datasets for evaluation, including two diagnostic and one from natural videos with human-labeled text. Extensive experimental results show that M3L-Transformer is effective for video editing and that LBVE can lead to a new field toward vision-and-language research."}

To deal with the performance drop induced by quantization errors, a popular method is to use training data to fine-tune quantized networks. In real-world environments, however, such a method is frequently infeasible because training data is unavailable due to security, privacy, or confidentiality concerns. Zero-shot quantization addresses such problems, usually by taking information from the weights of a full-precision teacher network to compensate the performance drop of the quantized networks. In this paper, we first analyze the loss surface of state-of-the-art zero-shot quantization techniques and provide several findings. In contrast to usual knowledge distillation problems, zero-shot quantization often suffers from 1) the difficulty of optimizing multiple loss terms together, and 2) the poor generalization capability due to the use of synthetic samples. Furthermore, we observe that many weights fail to cross the rounding threshold during training the quantized networks even when it is necessary to do so for better performance. Based on the observations, we propose AIT, a simple yet powerful technique for zero-shot quantization, which addresses the aforementioned two problems in the following way: AIT i) uses a KL distance loss only without a cross-entropy loss, and ii) manipulates gradients to guarantee that a certain portion of weights are properly updated after crossing the rounding thresholds. Experiments show that AIT outperforms the performance of many existing methods by a great margin, taking over the overall state-of-the-art position in the field."}

At test time, it takes as input a target image and a textured 3D query model. The core idea is to represent a 3D model with a number of 2D templates rendered from different viewpoints. This enables CNN-based direct dense feature extraction and matching. The object is first localized in 2D, then its approximate viewpoint is estimated, followed by dense 2D-3D correspondence prediction. The final pose is computed with PnP. We evaluate the method on LineMOD, Occlusion, Homebrewed, YCB-V and TLESS datasets and report very competitive performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods trained on synthetic data, even though our method is not trained on the object models used for testing."}

In light of this prototype view, this study uncovers several limitations of such parametric segmentation regime, and proposes a nonparametric alternative based on non-learnable prototypes. Instead of prior methods learning a single weight/query vector for each class in a fully parametric manner, our model represents each class as a set of non-learnable prototypes, relying solely on the mean features of several training pixels within that class. The dense prediction is thus achieved by nonparametric nearest prototype retrieving. This allows our model to directly shape the pixel embedding space, by optimizing the arrangement between embedded pixels and anchored prototypes. It is able to handle arbitrary number of classes with a constant amount of learnable parameters.We empirically show that, with FCN based and attention based segmentation models (i.e., HRNet, Swin, SegFormer) and backbones (i.e., ResNet, HRNet, Swin, MiT), our nonparametric framework yields compelling results over several datasets (i.e., ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff), and performs well in the large-vocabulary situation. We expect this work will provoke a rethink of the current de facto semantic segmentation model design."}

Among a plethora of efforts to bypass training of each candidate architecture to convergence for evaluation, the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is emerging as a promising theoretical framework that can be utilized to estimate the performance of a neural architecture at initialization. In this work, we revisit several at-initialization metrics that can be derived from the NTK and reveal their key shortcomings. Then, through the empirical analysis of the time evolution of NTK, we deduce that modern neural architectures exhibit highly non-linear characteristics, making the NTK-based metrics incapable of reliably estimating the performance of an architecture without some amount of training. To take such non-linear characteristics into account, we introduce Label-Gradient Alignment (LGA), a novel NTK-based metric whose inherent formulation allows it to capture the large amount of non-linear advantage present in modern neural architectures. With minimal amount of training, LGA obtains a meaningful level of rank correlation with the post-training test accuracy of an architecture. Lastly, we demonstrate that LGA, complemented with few epochs of training, successfully guides existing search algorithms to achieve competitive search performances with significantly less search cost.

However, the explicit and individual control of synthesis over multiple factors, such as poses, body shapes, and skin colors, remains difficult for existing methods. This is because current methods mainly rely on a single pose/appearance model, which is limited in disentangling various poses and appearance in human images. In addition, such a unimodal strategy is prone to causing severe artifacts in the generated images like color distortions and unrealistic textures. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a multi-factor conditioned method dubbed BodyGAN. Specifically, given a source image, our Body-GAN aims at capturing the characteristics of the human body from multiple aspects: (i) A pose encoding branch consisting of three hybrid subnetworks is adopted, to generate the semantic segmentation based representation, the 3D surface based representation, and the key point based representation of the human body, respectively. (ii) Based on the segmentation results, an appearance encoding branch is used to obtain the appearance information of the human body parts. (iii) The outputs of these two branches are represented by user-editable condition maps, which are then processed by a generator to predict the synthesized image. In this way, our BodyGAN can achieve the fine-grained disentanglement of pose, body shape, and appearance, and consequently enable the explicit and effective control of synthesis with diverse conditions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and a comprehensive user-study show that our BodyGAN achieves the state-of-the-art performance."}

Most existing learned image compression models are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Despite great contributions, a main drawback of CNN based model is that its structure is not designed for capturing local redundancy, especially the non-repetitive textures, which severely affects the reconstruction quality. Therefore, how to make full use of both global structure and local texture becomes the core problem for learning-based image compression. Inspired by recent progresses of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Swin Transformer, we found that combining the local-aware attention mechanism with the global-related feature learning could meet the expectation in image compression. In this paper, we first extensively study the effects of multiple kinds of attention mechanisms for local features learning, then introduce a more straightforward yet effective window-based local attention block. The proposed window-based attention is very flexible which could work as a plug-and-play component to enhance CNN and Transformer models. Moreover, we propose a novel Symmetrical TransFormer (STF) framework with absolute transformer blocks in the down-sampling encoder and up-sampling decoder.

Different from raster images, CAD drawings are vector graphics consisting of geometric primitives such as segments, arcs, and circles. By treating each CAD drawing as a graph, we propose a novel graph attention network GAT-CADNet to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem: vertex features derived from the GAT branch are mapped to semantic labels, while their attention scores are cascaded and mapped to instance prediction. Our key contributions are three-fold: 1) the instance symbol spotting task is formulated as a subgraph detection problem and solved by predicting the adjacency matrix; 2) a relative spatial encoding (RSE) module explicitly encodes the relative positional and geometric relation among vertices to enhance the vertex attention; 3) a cascaded edge encoding (CEE) module extracts vertex attentions from multiple stages of GAT and treats them as edge encoding to predict the adjacency matrix. The proposed GAT-CADNet is intuitive yet effective and manages to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem in one consolidated network. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the public benchmark show that our graph-based approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."}

At the core of our method is the fundamental observation that GANs are incredibly successful at encoding semantic information within their latent space, even in a completely unsupervised setting. For modern generative frameworks, this semantic encoding manifests as smooth, linear directions which affect image attributes in a disentangled manner. These directions have been widely used in GAN-based image editing. In this work, we leverage them for few-shot regression. Specifically, we make the simple observation that distances traversed along such directions are good features for downstream tasks - reliably gauging the magnitude of a property in an image. In the absence of explicit supervision, we use these distances to solve tasks such as sorting a collection of images, and ordinal regression. With a few labels -- as little as two -- we calibrate these distances to real-world values and convert a pre-trained GAN into a state-of-the-art few-shot regression model. This enables solving regression tasks on datasets and attributes which are difficult to produce quality supervision for. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method can be applied across a wide range of domains, leverage multiple latent direction discovery frameworks, and achieve state-of-the-art results in few-shot and low-supervision settings, even when compared to methods designed to tackle a single task.

However, there are still two challenges that are not addressed: (1) there is no prior SS-OD work on anchor-free detectors, and (2) prior works are ineffective when pseudo-labeling bounding box regression. In this paper, we present Unbiased Teacher v2, which shows the generalization of SS-OD method to anchor-free detectors and also introduces Listen2Student mechanism for the unsupervised regression loss. Specifically, we first present a study examining the effectiveness of existing SS-OD methods on anchor-free detectors and find that they achieve much lower performance improvements under the semi-supervised setting. We also observe that box selection with centerness and the localization-based labeling used in anchor-free detectors cannot work well under the semi-supervised setting. On the other hand, our Listen2Student mechanism explicitly prevents misleading pseudo-labels in the training of bounding box regression; we specifically develop a novel pseudo-labeling selection mechanism based on the Teacher and Student's relative uncertainties. This idea contributes to favorable improvement in the regression branch in the semi-supervised setting. Our method, which works for both anchor-free and anchor-based methods, consistently performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in VOC, COCO-standard, and COCO-additional."}

We reveal that HRNet's high-resolution branches are redundant for models at the low-computation region via our gradual shrinking experiments. Removing them improves both efficiency and performance. Inspired by this finding, we design LitePose, an efficient single-branch architecture for pose estimation, and introduce two simple approaches to enhance the capacity of LitePose, including fusion deconv head and large kernel conv. On mobile platforms, LitePose reduces the latency by up to 5.0x without sacrificing performance, compared with prior state-of-the-art efficient pose estimation models, pushing the frontier of real-time multi-person pose estimation on edge.

A main limitation of conventional NeRFs is that they often fail to produce high-quality renderings under novel viewpoints that are significantly different from the training viewpoints. In this paper, instead of exploiting few-shot image synthesis, we study the novel view extrapolation setting that (1) the training images can well describe an object, and (2) there is a notable discrepancy between the training and test viewpoints' distributions. We present RapNeRF (RAy Priors) as a solution. Our insight is that the inherent appearances of a 3D surface's arbitrary visible projections should be consistent. We thus propose a random ray casting policy that allows training unseen views using seen views. Furthermore, we show that a ray atlas pre-computed from the observed rays' viewing directions could further enhance the rendering quality for extrapolated views. A main limitation is that RapNeRF would remove the strong view-dependent effects because it leverages the multi-view consistency property."}

Most existing methods for 3D-aware image manipulation are limited to (1) only changing the global scene information or depth, or (2) manipulating an object of specific categories. In this paper, we present a 3D-aware image deformation method with minimal restrictions on shape category and deformation type. While our framework leverages 2D-to-3D reconstruction, we argue that reconstruction is not sufficient for realistic deformations due to the vulnerability to topological errors. Thus, we propose to take a supervised learning-based approach to predict the shape Laplacian of the underlying volume of a 3D reconstruction represented as a point cloud. Given the deformation energy calculated using the predicted shape Laplacian and user-defined deformation handles (e.g., keypoints), we obtain bounded biharmonic weights to model plausible handle-based image deformation. In the experiments, we present our results of deforming 2D character and clothed human images. We also quanti- tatively show that our approach can produce more accurate deformation weights compared to alternative methods (i.e., mesh reconstruction and point cloud Laplacian methods)."}

By using it, we can accurately estimate adversarial saliency for model parameters and determine which parameters can be pruned without weakening adversarial robustness. Furthermore, we reveal that model parameters of initial layer are highly sensitive to the adversarial examples and show that compressed feature representation retains semantic information for the target objects. Through extensive experiments on three public datasets, we demonstrate that MAD effectively prunes adversarially trained networks without loosing adversarial robustness and shows better performance than previous adversarial pruning methods."}

Though NeRF can produce photorealistic renderings of unseen viewpoints when many input views are available, its performance drops significantly when this number is reduced. We observe that the majority of artifacts in sparse input scenarios are caused by errors in the estimated scene geometry, and by divergent behavior at the start of training. We address this by regularizing the geometry and appearance of patches rendered from unobserved viewpoints, and annealing the ray sampling space during training. We additionally use a normalizing flow model to regularize the color of unobserved viewpoints. Our model outperforms not only other methods that optimize over a single scene, but in many cases also conditional models that are extensively pre-trained on large multi-view datasets."}

Gestures with meaningful signs can better convey useful information and arouse sympathy in the audience. Current works focus on aligning gestures with the speech rhythms, which are hard to mine the semantics and model semantic gestures explicitly. In this paper, we propose a novel method SEmantic Energized Generation (SEEG), for semantic-aware gesture generation. Our method contains two parts: DEcoupled Mining module (DEM) and Semantic Energizing Module (SEM). DEM decouples the semantic-irrelevant information from inputs and separately mines information for the beat and semantic gestures. SEM conducts semantic learning and produces semantic gestures. Apart from representational similarity, SEM requires the predictions to express the same semantics as the ground truth. Besides, a semantic prompter is designed in SEM to leverage the semantic-aware supervision to predictions. This promotes the networks to learn and generate semantic gestures. Experimental results reported in three metrics on different benchmarks prove that SEEG efficiently mines semantic cues and generates semantic gestures. In comparison, SEEG outperforms other methods in all semantic-aware evaluations on different datasets. Qualitative evaluations also indicate the superiority of SEEG in semantic expressiveness."}

To this end, we introduce AdaViT, an adaptive computation framework that learns to derive usage policies on which patches, self-attention heads and transformer blocks to use throughout the backbone on a per-input basis, aiming to improve inference efficiency of vision transformers with a minimal drop of accuracy for image recognition. Optimized jointly with a transformer backbone in an end-to-end manner, a light-weight decision network is attached to the backbone to produce decisions on-the-fly. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that our method obtains more than 2x improvement on efficiency compared to state-of-the-art vision transformers with only 0.8% drop of accuracy, achieving good efficiency/accuracy trade-offs conditioned on different computational budgets.

A major challenge in burst-denoising is in coping with pixel misalignment, which was so far handled with rather simplistic assumptions of simple motion, or the ability to align in pre-processing. Such assumptions are not realistic in the presence of large motion and high levels of noise. We show that Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), originally suggested for physics-based novel-view rendering, can serve as a powerful framework for burst denoising. NeRFs have an inherent capability of handling noise as they integrate information from multiple images, but they are limited in doing so, mainly since they build on pixel-wise operations which are suitable to ideal imaging conditions. Our approach, termed NAN, leverages inter-view and spatial information in NeRFs to better deal with noise. It achieves state-of-the-art results in burst denoising and is especially successful in coping with large movement and occlusions, under very high levels of noise. With the rapid advances in accelerating NeRFs, it could provide a powerful platform for denoising in challenging environments."}

However, capturing the motion and global position only from a sparse set of inertial sensors is inherently ambiguous and challenging. In consequence, recent state-of-the-art methods can barely handle very long period motions, and unrealistic artifacts are common due to the unawareness of physical constraints. To this end, we present the first method which combines a neural kinematics estimator and a physics-aware motion optimizer to track body motions with only 6 inertial sensors. The kinematics module first regresses the motion status as a reference, and then the physics module refines the motion to satisfy the physical constraints. Experiments demonstrate a clear improvement over the state of the art in terms of capture accuracy, temporal stability, and physical correctness."}

To solve these two problems, a simple-but-efficient regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process. Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters from too large.

This may lead to a strange phenomenon that sometimes there is no valid object in the mixed image due to the random process in augmentation but there is still response in the label space. To bridge such gap between the input and label spaces, we propose TransMix, which mixes labels based on the attention maps of Vision Transformers. The confidence of the label will be larger if the corresponding input image is weighted higher by the attention map. TransMix is embarrassingly simple and can be implemented in just a few lines of code without introducing any extra parameters and FLOPs to ViT-based models. Experimental results show that our method can consistently improve various ViT-based models at scales on ImageNet classification. After pre-trained with TransMix on ImageNet, the ViT-based models also demonstrate better transferability to semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation. TransMix also exhibits to be more robust when evaluating on 4 different benchmarks. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/Beckschen/TransMix."}

However, previous pre-training methods for VLN either lack the ability to predict future actions or ignore the trajectory contexts, which are essential for a greedy navigation process. In this work, to promote the learning of spatio-temporal visual-textual correspondence as well as the agent's capability of decision making, we propose a novel history-and-order aware pre-training paradigm (HOP) with VLN-specific objectives that exploit the past observations and support future action prediction. Specifically, in addition to the commonly used Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Trajectory-Instruction Matching (TIM), we design two proxy tasks to model temporal order information: Trajectory Order Modeling (TOM) and Group Order Modeling (GOM). Moreover, our navigation action prediction is also enhanced by introducing the task of Action Prediction with History (APH), which takes into account the history visual perceptions. Extensive experimental results on four downstream VLN tasks (R2R, REVERIE, NDH, RxR) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared against several state-of-the-art agents."}

Existing SGG methods usually suffer from several issues, including 1) ambiguous object representations, as graph neural network-based message passing (GMP) modules are typically sensitive to spurious inter-node correlations, and 2) low diversity in relationship predictions due to severe class imbalance and a large number of missing annotations. To address both problems, in this paper, we propose a regularized unrolling network (RU-Net). We first study the relation between GMP and graph Laplacian denoising (GLD) from the perspective of the unrolling technique, determining that GMP can be formulated as a solver for GLD. Based on this observation, we propose an unrolled message passing module and introduce an l_p-based graph regularization to suppress spurious connections between nodes. Second, we propose a group diversity enhancement module that promotes the prediction diversity of relationships via rank maximization. Systematic experiments demonstrate that RU-Net is effective under a variety of settings and metrics. Furthermore, RU-Net achieves new state-of-the-arts on three popular databases: VG, VRD, and OI."}

We exploit the fact that linguistic descriptions of a shape can provide priors on the shape's parts -- as natural language has evolved to reflect human perception of the compositional structure of objects, essential to their recognition and use. For training we use the paired geometry / language data collected in the ShapeGlot work for their reference game, where a speaker creates an utterance to differentiate a target shape from two distractors and the listener has to find the target based on this utterance. Our network is designed to solve this target discrimination problem, carefully incorporating a Transformer-based attention module so that the output attention can precisely highlight the semantic part or parts described in the language. Furthermore, the network operates without any direct supervision on the 3D geometry itself. Surprisingly, we further demonstrate that the learned part information is generalizable to shape classes unseen during training.Our approach opens the possibility of learning 3D shape parts from language alone, without the need for large-scale part geometry annotations, thus facilitating annotation acquisition."}

In contrast to all previous NeRF methods, DIVeR uses deterministic rather than stochastic estimates of the volume rendering integral. DIVeR's representation is a voxel based field of features. To compute the volume rendering integral, a ray is broken into intervals, one per voxel; components of the volume rendering integral are estimated from the features for each interval using an MLP, and the components are aggregated. As a result, DIVeR can render thin translucent structures that are missed by other integrators. Furthermore, DIVeR's representation has semantics that is relatively exposed compared to other such methods -- moving feature vectors around in the voxel space results in natural edits. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons to current state-of-the-art methods show that DIVeR produces models that (1) render at or above state-of-the-art quality, (2) are very small without being baked, (3) render very fast without being baked, and (4) can be edited in natural ways."}

These tasks are particularly interesting in an unsupervised setting due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining dense image annotations, but existing unsupervised approaches struggle with complex scenes containing multiple objects. Differently from existing methods, which are purely based on deep learning, we take inspiration from traditional spectral segmentation methods by reframing image decomposition as a graph partitioning problem. Specifically, we examine the eigenvectors of the Laplacian of a feature affinity matrix from self-supervised networks. We find that these eigenvectors already decompose an image into meaningful segments, and can be readily used to localize objects in a scene. Furthermore, by clustering the features associated with these segments across a dataset, we can obtain well-delineated, nameable regions, i.e. semantic segmentations. Experiments on complex datasets (Pascal VOC, MS-COCO) demonstrate that our simple spectral method outperforms the state-of-the-art in unsupervised localization and segmentation by a significant margin. Furthermore, our method can be readily used for a variety of complex image editing tasks, such as background removal and compositing."}

This problem is even more severe for single-view-based systems due to strong occlusions. Based on these observations, we propose OcclusionFusion, a novel method to calculate occlusion-aware 3D motion to guide the reconstruction. In our technique, the motion of visible regions is first estimated and combined with temporal information to infer the motion of the occluded regions through an LSTM-involved graph neural network. Furthermore, our method computes the confidence of the estimated motion by modeling the network output with a probabilistic model, which alleviates untrustworthy motions and enables robust tracking. Experimental results on public datasets and our own recorded data show that our technique outperforms existing single-view-based real-time methods by a large margin. With the reduction of the motion errors, the proposed technique can handle long and challenging motion sequences.

Different video segmentation tasks (e.g., video semantic/instance/panoptic segmentation) are usually considered as distinct problems. State-of-the-art models adopted in the separate communities have diverged, and radically different approaches dominate in each task. By contrast, we make a crucial observation that video segmentation tasks could be generally formulated as the problem of assigning different predicted labels to video tubes (where a tube is obtained by linking segmentation masks along the time axis) and the labels may encode different values depending on the target task. The observation motivates us to develop TubeFormer-DeepLab, a simple and effective video mask transformer model that is widely applicable to multiple video segmentation tasks. TubeFormer-DeepLab directly predicts video tubes with task-specific labels (either pure semantic categories, or both semantic categories and instance identities), which not only significantly simplifies video segmentation models, but also advances state-of-the-art results on multiple video segmentation benchmarks."}

Few-shot font generation is thus required, as it requires only a few glyph references without fine-tuning during test. Existing methods follow the style-content disentanglement paradigm, and expect novel fonts to be produced by combining the style codes of the reference glyphs and the content representations of the source. However, these few-shot font generation methods either fail to capture content-independent style representations, or employ localized component-wise style representations, which is insufficient to model many Chinese font styles that involve hyper-component features such as inter-component spacing and \"connected-stroke\". To resolve these drawbacks and make the style representations more reliable, we propose a self-supervised cross-modality pre-training strategy and a cross-modality transformer-based encoder that is conditioned jointly on the glyph image and the corresponding stroke labels. The cross-modality encoder is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner to allow effective capture of cross- and intra-modality correlations, which facilitates the content-style disentanglement and modeling style representations of all scales (stroke-level, components-level and character-level). The pre-trained encoder is then applied to the downstream font generation task without fine-tuning. Experimental comparisons of our method with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate our method successfully transfers styles of all scales. In addition, it only requires one reference glyph and achieves the lowest rate of bad cases in the few-shot font generation task (28% lower than the second best)."}

By storing at every voxel both the signed distance field as well as its gradient vector field, we enhance the capability of implicit representations with approaches originally formulated for explicit surfaces. As concrete examples, we show that (1) the Gradient-SDF allows us to perform direct SDF tracking from depth images, using efficient storage schemes like hash maps, and that (2) the Gradient-SDF representation enables us to perform photometric bundle adjustment directly in a voxel representation (without transforming into a point cloud or mesh), naturally a fully implicit optimization of geometry and camera poses and easy geometry upsampling. Experimental results confirm that this leads to significantly sharper reconstructions. Since the overall SDF voxel structure is still respected, the proposed Gradient-SDF is equally suited for (GPU) parallelization as related approaches."}

As a representative work, the adaptive focus method (AdaFocus) has achieved a favorable trade-off between accuracy and inference speed by dynamically identifying and attending to the informative regions in each video frame. However, AdaFocus requires a complicated three-stage training pipeline (involving reinforcement learning), leading to slow convergence and is unfriendly to practitioners. This work reformulates the training of AdaFocus as a simple one-stage algorithm by introducing a differentiable interpolation-based patch selection operation, enabling efficient end-to-end optimization. We further present an improved training scheme to address the issues introduced by the one-stage formulation, including the lack of supervision, input diversity and training stability. Moreover, a conditional-exit technique is proposed to perform temporal adaptive computation on top of AdaFocus without additional training. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets (i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&V2, and Jester) demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the original AdaFocus and other competitive baselines, while being considerably more simple and efficient to train.

Current approaches all follow the Siamese paradigm based on appearance matching. However, LiDAR point clouds are usually textureless and incomplete, which hinders effective appearance matching. Besides, previous methods greatly overlook the critical motion clues among targets. In this work, beyond 3D Siamese tracking, we introduce a motion-centric paradigm to handle 3D SOT from a new perspective. Following this paradigm, we propose a matching-free two-stage tracker M^2-Track. At the 1^st-stage, M^2-Track localizes the target within successive frames via motion transformation. Then it refines the target box through motion-assisted shape completion at the 2^nd-stage. Extensive experiments confirm that M^2-Track significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-arts on three large-scale datasets while running at 57FPS ( 8%,  17%, and  22%) precision gains on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset respectively). Further analysis verifies each component's effectiveness and shows the motion-centric paradigm's promising potential when combined with appearance matching.

However, current methods still suffer from (i) brittle image-level fusion of complementary interpolation results, that fails in the presence of artifacts in the fused image, (ii) potentially temporally inconsistent and inefficient motion estimation procedures, that run for every inserted frame and (iii) low contrast regions that do not trigger events, and thus cause events-only motion estimation to generate artifacts. Moreover, previous methods were only tested on datasets consisting of planar and far-away scenes, which do not capture the full complexity of the real world. In this work, we address the above problems by introducing multi-scale feature-level fusion and computing one-shot non-linear inter-frame motion---which can be efficiently sampled for image warping---from events and images. We also collect the first large-scale events and frames dataset consisting of more than 100 challenging scenes with depth variations, captured with a new experimental setup based on a beamsplitter. We show that our method improves the reconstruction quality by up to 0.2 dB in terms of PSNR and by up to 15% in LPIPS score. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance."}

SFL is a recent distributed training scheme where multiple clients send intermediate activations (i.e., feature map), instead of raw data, to a central server. While such a scheme helps reduce the computational load at the client end, it opens itself to reconstruction of raw data from intermediate activation by the server. Existing works on protecting SFL only consider inference and do not handle attacks during training. So we propose ResSFL, a Split Federated Learning Framework that is designed to be MI-resistant during training. It is based on deriving a resistant feature extractor via attacker-aware training, and using this extractor to initialize the client-side model prior to standard SFL training. Such a method helps in reducing the computational complexity due to use of strong inversion model in client-side adversarial training as well as vulnerability of attacks launched in early training epochs. On CIFAR-100 dataset, our proposed framework successfully mitigates MI attack on a VGG-11 model with a high reconstruction Mean-Square-Error of 0.050 compared to 0.005 obtained by the baseline system. The framework achieves 67.5% accuracy (only 1% accuracy drop) with very low computation overhead. Code is released at: https://github.com/zlijingtao/ResSFL"}

This bio-mimetic mechanism of SNN appears energy-efficiency with its power sparsity and asynchronous operations on spike events. Unfortunately, with the propagation of binary spikes, the distribution of membrane potential will shift, leading to degeneration, saturation, and gradient mismatch problems, which would be disadvantageous to the network optimization and convergence. Such undesired shifts would prevent the SNN from performing well and going deep. To tackle these problems, we attempt to rectify the membrane potential distribution (MPD) by designing a novel distribution loss, MPD-Loss, which can explicitly penalize the undesired shifts without introducing any additional operations in the inference phase. Moreover, the proposed method can also mitigate the quantization error in SNNs, which is usually ignored in other works. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can directly train a deeper, larger and better performing SNN within fewer timesteps."}

However, videos inherently express a much wider gamut of information than texts. Instead, texts often capture sub-regions of entire videos and are most semantically similar to certain frames within videos. Therefore, for a given text, a retrieval model should focus on the text's most semantically similar video sub-regions to make a more relevant comparison. Yet, most existing works aggregate entire videos without directly considering text. Common text-agnostic aggregations schemes include mean-pooling or self-attention over the frames, but these are likely to encode misleading visual information not described in the given text. To address this, we propose a cross-modal attention model called X-Pool that reasons between a text and the frames of a video. Our core mechanism is a scaled dot product attention for a text to attend to its most semantically similar frames. We then generate an aggregated video representation conditioned on the text's attention weights over the frames. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets of MSR-VTT, MSVD and LSMDC, achieving new state-of-the-art results by up to 12% in relative improvement in Recall@1. Our findings thereby highlight the importance of joint text-video reasoning to extract important visual cues according to text.

Instead of sequentially scanning a scene and directly recording depth via the photon time-of-flight, as in pulsed LiDAR sensors, gated imagers encode depth in the relative intensity of a handful of gated slices, captured at megapixel resolution. Although existing methods have shown that it is possible to decode high-resolution depth from such measurements, these methods require synchronized and calibrated LiDAR to supervise the gated depth decoder - prohibiting fast adoption across geographies, training on large unpaired datasets, and exploring alternative applications outside of automotive use cases. In this work, we fill this gap and propose an entirely self-supervised depth estimation method that uses gated intensity profiles and temporal consistency as a training signal. The proposed model is trained end-to-end from gated video sequences, does not require LiDAR or RGB data, and learns to estimate absolute depth values. We take gated slices as input and disentangle the estimation of the scene albedo, depth, and ambient light, which are then used to learn to reconstruct the input slices through a cyclic loss. We rely on temporal consistency between a given frame and neighboring gated slices to estimate depth in regions with shadows and reflections. We experimentally validate that the proposed approach outperforms existing supervised and self-supervised depth estimation methods based on monocular RGB and stereo images, as well as supervised methods based on gated images."}

However, the success largely depends on the assumption that the labeled and unlabeled data share an identical class distribution, which is hard to meet in real practice. The distribution mismatch between the labeled and unlabeled sets can cause severe bias in the pseudo-labels of SSL, resulting in significant performance degradation. To bridge this gap, we put forward a new SSL learning framework, named Distribution Consistency SSL (DC-SSL), which rectifies the pseudo-labels from a distribution perspective. The basic idea is to directly estimate a reference class distribution (RCD), which is regarded as a surrogate of the ground truth class distribution about the unlabeled data, and then improve the pseudo-labels by encouraging the predicted class distribution (PCD) of the unlabeled data to approach RCD gradually. To this end, this paper revisits the Exponentially Moving Average (EMA) model and utilizes it to estimate RCD in an iteratively improved manner, which is achieved with a momentum-update scheme throughout the training procedure. On top of this, two strategies are proposed for RCD to rectify the pseudo-label prediction, respectively. They correspond to an efficient training-free scheme and a training-based alternative that generates more accurate and reliable predictions. DC-SSL is evaluated on multiple SSL benchmarks and demonstrates remarkable performance improvement over competitive methods under matched- and mismatched-distribution scenarios."}

As a step in this direction, the ArtEmis dataset was recently introduced as a large-scale dataset of emotional reactions to images along with language explanations of these chosen emotions. We observed a significant emotional bias towards instance-rich emotions, making trained neural speakers less accurate in describing under-represented emotions. We show that collecting new data, in the same way, is not effective in mitigating this emotional bias. To remedy this problem, we propose a contrastive data collection approach to balance ArtEmis with a new complementary dataset such that a pair of similar images have contrasting emotions (one positive and one negative). We collected 260,533 instances using the proposed method, we combine them with ArtEmis, creating a second iteration of the dataset.

The widely used rolling-shutter (RS) image sensors, however, suffer from geometric distortion when the camera and object undergo motion during capture. Extensive researches have been conducted on correcting RS distortions. However, most of the existing work relies heavily on the prior assumptions of scenes or motions. Besides, the motion estimation steps are either oversimplified or computationally inefficient due to the heavy flow warping, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we investigate using rolling shutter with a global reset feature (RSGR) to restore clean global shutter (GS) videos. This feature enables us to turn the rectification problem into a deblur-like one, getting rid of inaccurate and costly explicit motion estimation. First, we build an optic system that captures paired RSGR/GS videos. Second, we develop a novel algorithm incorporating spatial and temporal designs to correct the spatial-varying RSGR distortion. Third, we demonstrate that existing image-to-image translation algorithms can recover clean GS videos from distorted RSGR inputs, yet our algorithm achieves the best performance with the specific designs. Our rendered results are not only visually appealing but also beneficial to downstream tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art RS solution, our RSGR solution is superior in both effectiveness and efficiency. Considering it is easy to realize without changing the hardware, we believe our RSGR solution can potentially replace the RS solution in taking distortion-free videos with low noise and low budget."}

Manipulating the pose of an object, however, requires the understanding of its underlying structure, that is, its joints and how they interact with each other. Unfortunately, assuming the structure to be known, as existing methods do, precludes the ability to work on new object categories. We propose to learn both the appearance and the structure of previously unseen articulated objects by observing them move from multiple views, with no joints annotation supervision, or information about the structure. We observe that 3D points that are static relative to one another should belong to the same part, and that adjacent parts that move relative to each other must be connected by a joint. To leverage this insight, we model the object parts in 3D as ellipsoids, which allows us to identify joints. We combine this explicit representation with an implicit one that compensates for the approximation introduced. We show that our method works for different structures, from quadrupeds, to single-arm robots, to humans."}

Consequently, approaches on these respective tasks are eligible to complement each other. Therefore, we introduce PoseTrack21, a large-scale dataset for person search, multi-object tracking and multi-person pose tracking in real-world scenarios with a high diversity of poses. The dataset provides rich annotations like human pose annotations including annotations of joint occlusions, bounding box annotations even for small persons, and person-ids within and across video sequences. The dataset allows to evaluate multi-object tracking and multi-person pose tracking jointly with person re-identification or exploit structural knowledge of human poses to improve person search and tracking, particularly in the context of severe occlusions. With PoseTrack21, we want to encourage researchers to work on joint approaches that perform reasonably well on all three tasks."}

Yet, to achieve the high safety requirement, these perceptual systems must operate robustly under a wide variety of weather conditions including snow and rain. In this paper, we present a new dataset to enable robust autonomous driving via a novel data collection process --- data is repeatedly recorded along a 15 km route under diverse scene (urban, highway, rural, campus), weather (snow, rain, sun), time (day/night), and traffic conditions (pedestrians, cyclists and cars). The dataset includes images and point clouds from cameras and LiDAR sensors, along with high-precision GPS/INS to establish correspondence across routes. The dataset includes road and object annotations using amodal masks to capture partial occlusions and 2D/3D bounding boxes. We demonstrate the uniqueness of this dataset by analyzing the performance of baselines in amodal segmentation of road and objects, depth estimation, and 3D object detection. The repeated routes opens new research directions in object discovery, continual learning, and anomaly detection."}

However, most existing models utilize the hand-crafted loss functions, which are usually sub-optimal and challenging to be designed. In this paper, we propose a novel method, AutoLoss-GMS, to search the better loss function in the space of generalized margin-based softmax loss function for person re-identification automatically. Specifically, the generalized margin-based softmax loss function is first decomposed into two computational graphs and a constant. Then a general searching framework built upon the evolutionary algorithm is proposed to search for the loss function efficiently. The computational graph is constructed with a forward method, which can construct much richer loss function forms than the backward method used in existing works. In addition to the basic in-graph mutation operations, the cross-graph mutation operation is designed to further improve the offspring's diversity. The loss-rejection protocol, equivalence-check strategy and the predictor-based promising-loss chooser are developed to improve the search efficiency. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the searched loss functions can achieve state-of-the-art performance and be transferable across different models and datasets in person re-identification."}

We selected recurring actors and annotated 431K segmentation masks at a frame rate of six, exceeding previous datasets in average video duration, object variation, and narrative structure complexity. We incorporated good practices of model architecture design, memory management, and multi-shot tracking into an existing video segmentation method to build competitive baseline methods. Through error analysis, we found that these baselines still fail to cope with cross-shot appearance variation on our YouMVOS dataset.

This process is studied in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Even though a large number of methods propose new adaptation strategies, they are mostly based on outdated network architectures. As the influence of recent network architectures has not been systematically studied, we first benchmark different network architectures for UDA and newly reveal the potential of Transformers for UDA semantic segmentation. Based on the findings, we propose a novel UDA method, DAFormer. The network architecture of DAFormer consists of a Transformer encoder and a multi-level context-aware feature fusion decoder. It is enabled by three simple but crucial training strategies to stabilize the training and to avoid overfitting to the source domain: While (1) Rare Class Sampling on the source domain improves the quality of the pseudo-labels by mitigating the confirmation bias of self-training toward common classes, (2) a Thing-Class ImageNet Feature Distance and (3) a learning rate warmup promote feature transfer from ImageNet pretraining. DAFormer represents a major advance in UDA. It improves the state of the art by 10.8 mIoU for GTA-to-Cityscapes and 5.4 mIoU for Synthia-to-Cityscapes and enables learning even difficult classes such as train, bus, and truck well.

One of the effective research lines to address this challenge focuses on learning deep representations driven by a similarity measure between a query image and few support images of some class. Statistically, this amounts to measure the dependency of image features, viewed as random vectors in a high-dimensional embedding space. Previous methods either only use marginal distributions without considering joint distributions, suffering from limited representation capability, or are computationally expensive though harnessing joint distributions. In this paper, we propose a deep Brownian Distance Covariance (DeepBDC) method for few-shot classification. The central idea of DeepBDC is to learn image representations by measuring the discrepancy between joint characteristic functions of embedded features and product of the marginals. As the BDC metric is decoupled, we formulate it as a highly modular and efficient layer. Furthermore, we instantiate DeepBDC in two different few-shot classification frameworks. We make experiments on six standard few-shot image benchmarks, covering general object recognition, fine-grained categorization and cross-domain classification. Extensive evaluations show our DeepBDC significantly outperforms the counterparts, while establishing new state-of-the-art results. The source code is available at http://www.peihuali.org/DeepBDC."}

The key to this strategy lies in how to restore the global information that is lost by the input RI features. Most state-of-the-arts achieve this by incurring additional blocks or complex global representations, which is time-consuming and ineffective. In this paper, we real that the global information loss stems from an unexplored pose information loss problem, i.e., common convolution layers cannot capture the relative poses between RI features, thus hindering the global information to be hierarchically aggregated in the deep networks. To address this problem, we develop a Pose-aware Rotation Invariant Convolution (i.e., PaRI-Conv), which dynamically adapts its kernels based on the relative poses. Specifically, in each PaRI-Conv layer, a lightweight Augmented Point Pair Feature (APPF) is designed to fully encode the RI relative pose information. Then, we propose to synthesize a factorized dynamic kernel, which reduces the computational cost and memory burden by decomposing it into a shared basis matrix and a pose-aware diagonal matrix that can be learned from the APPF. Extensive experiments on shape classification and part segmentation tasks show that our PaRI-Conv surpasses the state-of-the-art RI methods while being more compact and efficient."}

However, the lack of paired training samples is the main bottleneck for unlocking the power of RGB-T tracking. Since it is laborious to collect high-quality RGB-T sequences, recent benchmarks only provide test sequences.

In addition, comprehensive applications (short-term tracking, long-term tracking and segmentation mask prediction) with diverse categories and scenes are considered for exhaustive evaluation. Moreover, we provide a coarse-to-fine attribute annotation, where frame-level attributes are provided to exploit the potential of challenge-specific trackers. In addition, we design a new RGB-T baseline, named Hierarchical Multi-modal Fusion Tracker (HMFT), which fuses RGB-T data in various levels. Numerous experiments on several datasets are conducted to reveal the effectiveness of HMFT and the complement of different fusion types. The project is available at here."}

This setting is in stark contrast to the majority of existing works that leverage multiple views of the same object, employ explicit priors during training, or require pixel-perfect annotations. To address this challenging setting, we propose to learn a normalized, object-centric representation whose embedding describes and disentangles shape, appearance, and pose. Each encoding provides well-generalizable, compact information about the object of interest, which is decoded in a single-shot into a new target view, thus enabling novel view synthesis. We further improve the reconstruction quality by optimizing shape and appearance codes at test time by fitting the representation tightly to the input image. In a series of experiments, we show that our method generalizes well to unseen objects, even across different datasets of challenging real-world street scenes such as nuScenes, KITTI, and Mapillary Metropolis.

Using a progressive clustering module we adaptively divide keypoints into different subgraphs to reduce redundant connectivity, and employ a coarse-to-fine paradigm for mitigating miss-classification within images.

Testing a pre-trained 3D pose estimator on a new dataset results in a major performance drop. Previous methods have mainly addressed this problem by improving the diversity of the training data. We argue that diversity alone is not sufficient and that the characteristics of the training data need to be adapted to those of the new dataset such as camera viewpoint, position, human actions, and body size. To this end, we propose AdaptPose, an end-to-end framework that generates synthetic 3D human motions from a source dataset and uses them to fine-tune a 3D pose estimator. AdaptPose follows an adversarial training scheme. From a source 3D pose the generator generates a sequence of 3D poses and a camera orientation that is used to project the generated poses to a novel view. Without any 3D labels or camera information AdaptPose successfully learns to create synthetic 3D poses from the target dataset while only being trained on 2D poses. In experiments on the Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, 3DPW, and Ski-Pose datasets our method outperforms previous work in cross-dataset evaluations by 14% and previous semi-supervised learning methods that use partial 3D annotations by 16%."}

Despite tremendous progress of image virtual try-on, they lead to inconsistency between frames when applied to videos. Limited work also explored the task of video-based virtual try-on but failed to produce visually pleasing and temporally coherent results. Moreover, there are two other key challenges: 1) how to generate accurate warping when occlusions appear in the clothing region; 2) how to generate clothes and non-target body parts (e.g. arms, neck) in harmony with the complicated background; To address them, we propose a novel video virtual try-on framework, ClothFormer, which successfully synthesizes realistic, harmonious, and spatio-temporal consistent results in complicated environment. In particular, ClothFormer involves three major modules. First, a two-stage anti-occlusion warping module that predicts an accurate dense flow mapping between the body regions and the clothing regions. Second, an appearance-flow tracking module utilizes ridge regression and optical flow correction to smooth the dense flow sequence and generate a temporally smooth warped clothing sequence. Third, a dual-stream transformer extracts and fuses clothing textures, person features, and environment information to generate realistic try-on videos. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that our method highly surpasses the baselines in terms of synthesized video quality both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

Previous methods mostly follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e., language-irrelevant detection and cross-modal matching, which is limited by the isolated architecture. In such a paradigm, the detector needs to sample keypoints from raw point clouds due to the inherent properties of 3D point clouds (irregular and large-scale), to generate the corresponding object proposal for each keypoint. However, sparse proposals may leave out the target in detection, while dense proposals may confuse the matching model. Moreover, the language-irrelevant detection stage can only sample a small proportion of keypoints on the target, deteriorating the target prediction. In this paper, we propose a 3D Single-Stage Referred Point Progressive Selection (3D-SPS) method, which progressively selects keypoints with the guidance of language and directly locates the target. Specifically, we propose a Description-aware Keypoint Sampling (DKS) module to coarsely focus on the points of language-relevant objects, which are significant clues for grounding. Besides, we devise a Target-oriented Progressive Mining (TPM) module to finely concentrate on the points of the target, which is enabled by progressive intra-modal relation modeling and inter-modal target mining. 3D-SPS bridges the gap between detection and matching in the 3D visual grounding task, localizing the target at a single stage.

Different from existing methods that depend on either an off-line actor detector or hand-designed actor-positional hypotheses like proposals or anchors, we propose to directly detect an action tubelet in video by simultaneously performing action localization and recognition from a single representation. TubeR learns a set of tubelet-queries and utilizes a tubelet-attention module to model the dynamic spatio-temporal nature of a video clip, which effectively reinforces the model capacity compared to using actor-positional hypotheses in the spatio-temporal space. For videos containing transitional states or scene changes, we propose a context aware classification head to utilize short-term and long-term context to strengthen action classification, and an action switch regression head for detecting the precise temporal action extent. TubeR directly produces action tubelets with variable lengths and even maintains good results for long video clips.

LASER introduces the concept of latent space rendering, where 2D pose hypotheses on the floor map are directly rendered into a geometrically-structured latent space by aggregating viewing ray features. Through a tightly coupled rendering codebook scheme, the viewing ray features are dynamically determined at rendering-time based on their geometries (i.e. length, incident-angle), endowing our representation with view-dependent fine-grain variability. Our codebook scheme effectively disentangles feature encoding from rendering, allowing the latent space rendering to run at speeds above 10KHz. Moreover, through metric learning, our geometrically-structured latent space is common to both pose hypotheses and query images with arbitrary field of views.

Data augmentation strategy plays a significant role in the SSL framework since it is hard to create a weak-strong augmented input pair without losing label information. Especially when extending SSL to semi-supervised object detection (SSOD), many strong augmentation methodologies related to image geometry and interpolation-regularization are hard to utilize since they possibly hurt the location information of the bounding box in the object detection task. To address this, we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation method, Mix/UnMix (MUM), which unmixes feature tiles for the mixed image tiles for the SSOD framework. Our proposed method makes mixed input image tiles and reconstructs them in the feature space. Thus, MUM can enjoy the interpolation-regularization effect from non-interpolated pseudo-labels and successfully generate a meaningful weak-strong pair. Furthermore, MUM can be easily equipped on top of various SSOD methods. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate the superiority of MUM by consistently improving the mAP performance over the baseline in all the tested SSOD benchmark protocols.

Unfortunately, software tools for effective data generation are less mature than those for architecture design and training, which leads to fragmented generation efforts. To address these problems we introduce Kubric, an open-source Python framework that interfaces with PyBullet and Blender to generate photo-realistic scenes, with rich annotations, and seamlessly scales to large jobs distributed over thousands of machines, and generating TBs of data.

Despite the increasing popularity of sensor fusion in this field, the robustness against inferior image conditions, e.g., bad illumination and sensor misalignment, is under-explored. Existing fusion methods are easily affected by such conditions, mainly due to a hard association of LiDAR points and image pixels, established by calibration matrices. We propose TransFusion, a robust solution to LiDAR-camera fusion with a soft-association mechanism to handle inferior image conditions. Specifically, our TransFusion consists of convolutional backbones and a detection head based on a transformer decoder. The first layer of the decoder predicts initial bounding boxes from a LiDAR point cloud using a sparse set of object queries, and its second decoder layer adaptively fuses the object queries with useful image features, leveraging both spatial and contextual relationships. The attention mechanism of the transformer enables our model to adaptively determine where and what information should be taken from the image, leading to a robust and effective fusion strategy. We additionally design an image-guided query initialization strategy to deal with objects that are difficult to detect in point clouds. TransFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate its robustness against degenerated image quality and calibration errors. We also extend the proposed method to the 3D tracking task and achieve the 1st place in the leaderboard of nuScenes tracking, showing its effectiveness and generalization capability."}

However, existing 3D lane detection datasets are either unpublished or synthesized from a simulated environment, severely hampering the development of this field. In this paper, we take steps towards addressing these issues. By exploiting the explicit relationship between point clouds and image pixels, a dataset annotation pipeline is designed to automatically generate high-quality 3D lane locations from 2D lane annotations in 211K road scenes. In addition, we present an extrinsic-free, anchor-free method, called SALAD, regressing the 3D coordinates of lanes in image view without converting the feature map into the bird's-eye view (BEV). To facilitate future research on 3D lane detection, we benchmark the dataset and provide a novel evaluation metric, performing extensive experiments of both existing approaches and our proposed method.

Since the data distribution on each client may vary dramatically, the client selection strategy can significantly influence the convergence rate of the FL process. Active client selection strategies are popularly proposed in recent studies. However, they neglect the loss correlations between the clients and achieve only marginal improvement compared to the uniform selection strategy. In this work, we propose FedCor---an FL framework built on a correlation-based client selection strategy, to boost the convergence rate of FL. Specifically, we first model the loss correlations between the clients with a Gaussian Process (GP).

Binary neural networks (BNNs) have the potential to significantly lower the compute intensity but existing models suffer from low quality. To overcome this deficiency, we propose PokeConv, a binary convolution block which improves quality of BNNs by techniques such as adding multiple residual paths, and tuning the activation function. We apply it to ResNet-50 and optimize ResNet's initial convolutional layer which is hard to binarize. We name the resulting network family PokeBNN. These techniques are chosen to yield favorable improvements in both top-1 accuracy and the network's cost. In order to enable joint optimization of the cost together with accuracy, we define arithmetic computation effort (ACE), a hardware- and energy-inspired cost metric for quantized and binarized networks. We also identify a need to optimize an under-explored hyper-parameter controlling the binarization gradient approximation. We establish a new, strong state-of-the-art (SOTA) on top-1 accuracy together with commonly-used CPU64 cost, ACE cost and network size metrics. ReActNet-Adam, the previous SOTA in BNNs, achieved a 70.5% top-1 accuracy with 7.9 ACE. A small variant of PokeBNN achieves 70.5% top-1 with 2.6 ACE, more than 3x reduction in cost; a larger PokeBNN achieves 75.6% top-1 with 7.8 ACE, more than 5% improvement in accuracy without increasing the cost.

They are hence largely limited to static models as training each frame is infeasible. We present HumanNeRF - a neural representation with efficient generalization ability - for high-fidelity free-view synthesis of dynamic humans. Analogous to how IBRNet assists NeRF by avoiding per-scene training, HumanNeRF employs an aggregated pixel-alignment feature across multi-view inputs along with a pose embedded non-rigid deformation field for tackling dynamic motions. The raw HumanNeRF can already produce reasonable rendering on sparse video inputs of unseen subjects and camera settings. To further improve the rendering quality, we augment our solution with in-hour scene-specific fine-tuning, and an appearance blending module for combining the benefits of both neural volumetric rendering and neural texture blending. Extensive experiments on various multi-view dynamic human datasets demonstrate effectiveness of our approach in synthesizing photo-realistic free-view humans under challenging motions and with very sparse camera view inputs."}

Apart from high intrinsic similarity between the camouflaged objects and their background, the objects are usually diverse in scale, fuzzy in appearance, and even severely occluded. To deal with these problems, we propose a mixed-scale triplet network, ZoomNet, which mimics the behavior of humans when observing vague images, i.e., zooming in and out. Specifically, our ZoomNet employs the zoom strategy to learn the discriminative mixed-scale semantics by the designed scale integration unit and hierarchical mixed-scale unit, which fully explores imperceptible clues between the candidate objects and background surroundings. Moreover, considering the uncertainty and ambiguity derived from indistinguishable textures, we construct a simple yet effective regularization constraint, uncertainty-aware loss, to promote the model to accurately produce predictions with higher confidence in candidate regions. Without bells and whistles, our proposed highly task-friendly model consistently surpasses the existing 23 state-of-the-art methods on four public datasets. Besides, the superior performance over the recent cutting-edge models on the SOD task also verifies the effectiveness and generality of our model.

As a result, the generated images usually contain artifacts or the filled pixels differ greatly from the ground truth, making them far from real-world applications. Image-level predictive filtering is a widely used restoration technique by predicting suitable kernels adaptively according to different input scenes. Inspired by this inherent advantage, we explore the possibility of addressing image inpainting as a filtering task. To this end, we first study the advantages and challenges of the image-level predictive filtering for inpainting: the method can preserve local structures and avoid artifacts but fails to fill large missing areas. Then, we propose the semantic filtering by conducting filtering on deep feature level, which fills the missing semantic information but fails to recover the details. To address the issues while adopting the respective advantages, we propose a novel filtering technique, i.e., Multi-level Interactive Siamese Filtering (MISF) containing two branches: kernel prediction branch (KPB) and semantic & image filtering branch (SIFB). These two branches are interactively linked: SIFB provides multi-level features for KPB while KPB predicts dynamic kernels for SIFB. As a result, the final method takes the advantage of effective semantic & image-level filling for high-fidelity inpainting. Moreover, we discuss the relationship between MISF and the naive encoder-decoder-based inpainting, inferring that MISF provides novel dynamic convolutional operations to enhance the high generalization capability across scenes. We validate our method on three challenging datasets, i.e., Dunhuang, Places2, and CelebA. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four metrics, i.e., L1, PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS."}

However, they are limited to single-scale feature resolution, providing suboptimal performance in scenes containing humans, objects, and their interactions with vastly different scales and distances. To tackle this problem, we propose a Multi-Scale TRansformer (MSTR) for HOI detection powered by two novel HOI-aware deformable attention modules called Dual-Entity attention and Entity-conditioned Context attention. While existing deformable attention comes at a huge cost in HOI detection performance, our proposed attention modules of MSTR learn to effectively attend to sampling points that are essential to identify interactions.

Specifically, when compressing the current frame from each view, our framework reduces temporal redundancy by performing motion compensation using the reconstructed intra-view adjacent frame and at the same time exploits binocular redundancy by conducting disparity compensation using the latest reconstructed cross-view frame. Moreover, to effectively compress the introduced motion and disparity offsets for better compensation, we further propose two novel schemes called motion residual compression and disparity residual compression to respectively generate the predicted motion offset and disparity offset from the previously compressed motion offset and disparity offset, such that we can more effectively compress residual offset information for better bit-rate saving. Overall, the entire framework is implemented by the fully-differentiable modules and can be optimized in an end-to-end manner. Our comprehensive experiments on three automotive stereo video benchmarks Cityscapes, KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the learning-based single-view video codec and the traditional hand-crafted multi-view video codec."}

DetectorDetective enables users to easily learn about how the three key modules of the Faster R-CNN object detector -- Feature Pyramidal Network, Region Proposal Network, and Region Of Interest Head--respond to a user-selected benign image and its adversarial version. Visualizations about the progressive changes in the intermediate features among such modules help users gain insights into the impact of adversarial attacks, and perform side-by-side comparisons between the benign and adversarial responses.

Prior arts learn multi-sphere image (MSI) representations that enables fast rendering times but are only limited to modelling low-dimensional color values. Modelling high-dimensional appearance features in MSI can result in better view synthesis, but it is not feasible to represent high-dimensional features in a large number (>64) of MSI spheres. We propose a novel MSI representation called Soft Occlusion MSI (SOMSI) that enables modelling high-dimensional appearance features in MSI while retaining the fast rendering times of a standard MSI. Our key insight is to model appearance features in a smaller set (e.g. 3) of occlusion levels instead of larger number of MSI levels. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world scenes demonstrate that using SOMSI can provide a good balance between accuracy and runtime. SOMSI can produce considerably better results compared to MSI based MODS, while having similar fast rendering time. SOMSI view synthesis quality is on-par with state-of-the-art NeRF like model while being 2 orders of magnitude faster.

However, they have some insuperable drawbacks, e.g., they cannot handle videos without references, and they may result in biased evaluation due to the one-to-many nature of video-to-text and the neglect of visual relevance. From the human evaluator's viewpoint, a high-quality caption should be consistent with the provided video, but not necessarily be similar to the reference in literal or semantics. Inspired by human evaluation, we propose EMScore (Embedding Matching-based score), a novel reference-free metric for video captioning, which directly measures similarity between video and candidate captions. Benefiting from the recent development of large-scale pre-training models, we exploit a well pre-trained vision-language model to extract visual and linguistic embeddings for computing EMScore. Specifically, EMScore combines matching scores of both coarse-grained (video and caption) and fine-grained (frames and words) levels, which takes the overall understanding and detailed characteristics of the video into account. Furthermore, considering the potential information gain, EMScore can be flexibly extended to the conditions where human-labeled references are available. Last but not least, we collect VATEX-EVAL and ActivityNet-FOIl datasets to systematically evaluate the existing metrics. VATEX-EVAL experiments demonstrate that EMScore has higher human correlation and lower reference dependency. ActivityNet-FOIL experiment verifies that EMScore can effectively identify hallucinating captions. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/shiyaya/emscore."}

In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised approach that allows us to explicitly generate 2D-3D pose pairs for augmenting supervision, through a self-enhancing dual-loop learning framework. This is made possible via introducing a reinforcement-learning-based imitator, which is learned jointly with a pose estimator alongside a pose hallucinator; the three components form two loops during the training process, complementing and strengthening one another. Specifically, the pose estimator transforms an input 2D pose sequence to a low-fidelity 3D output, which is then enhanced by the imitator that enforces physical constraints. The refined 3D poses are subsequently fed to the hallucinator for producing even more diverse data, which are, in turn, strengthened by the imitator and further utilized to train the pose estimator. Such a co-evolution scheme, in practice, enables training a pose estimator on self-generated motion data without relying on any given 3D data. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields encouraging results significantly outperforming the state of the art and, in some cases, even on par with results of fully-supervised methods. Notably, it achieves 89.1% 3D PCK on MPI-INF-3DHP under self-supervised cross-dataset evaluation setup, improving upon the previous best self-supervised method by 8.6%.

This approach builds on the recently released ARM algorithm, which replaces the continuous next-best pose agent with a discrete one, with coarse-to-fine Q-attention. Given a voxelised scene, coarse-to-fine Q-attention learns what part of the scene to 'zoom' into. When this 'zooming' behaviour is applied iteratively, it results in a near-lossless discretisation of the translation space, and allows the use of a discrete action, deep Q-learning method. We show that our new coarse-to-fine algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on several difficult sparsely rewarded RLBench vision-based robotics tasks, and can train real-world policies, tabula rasa, in a matter of minutes, with as little as 3 demonstrations."}

In this paper, we present L2G, a simple online local-to-global knowledge transfer framework for high-quality object attention mining.

Taking this into account, we first leverage a local classification network to extract attentions from multiple local patches randomly cropped from the input image. Then, we utilize a global network to learn complementary attention knowledge across multiple local attention maps online. Our framework conducts the global network to learn the captured rich object detail knowledge from a global view and thereby produces high-quality attention maps that can be directly used as pseudo annotations for semantic segmentation networks.

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the dominant architectures for such tasks, recently introduced Vision Transformers (ViTs) aim to replace them as a backbone. Similar to CNNs, ViTs build a simple multi-stage structure (i.e., fine-to-coarse) for multi-scale representation with single-scale patches. In this work, with a different perspective from existing Transformers, we explore multi-scale patch embedding and multi-path structure, constructing the Multi-Path Vision Transformer (MPViT). MPViT embeds features of the same size (i.e., sequence length) with patches of different scales simultaneously by using overlapping convolutional patch embedding. Tokens of different scales are then independently fed into the Transformer encoders via multiple paths and the resulting features are aggregated, enabling both fine and coarse feature representations at the same feature level. Thanks to the diverse, multi-scale feature representations, our MPViTs scaling from tiny (5M) to base (73M) consistently achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art Vision Transformers on ImageNet classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. These extensive results demonstrate that MPViT can serve as a versatile backbone network for various vision tasks."}

Existing work focuses on improving NICG model accuracy while efficiency is less explored. However, many real-world applications require real-time feedback, which highly relies on the efficiency of NICG models. Recent research observed that the efficiency of NICG models could vary for different inputs. This observation brings in a new attack surface of NICG models, i.e., An adversary might be able to slightly change inputs to cause the NICG models to consume more computational resources. To further understand such efficiency-oriented threats, we propose a new attack approach, NICGSlowDown, to evaluate the efficiency robustness of NICG models. Our experimental results show that NICGSlowDown can generate images with human-unnoticeable perturbations that will increase the NICG model latency up to 483.86%. We hope this research could raise the community's concern about the efficiency robustness of NICG models."}

This is a very challenging problem, as large occlusions and many confusions between the joints may happen. State-of-the-art methods solve this problem by regressing a heatmap for each joint, which requires solving two problems simultaneously: localizing the joints and recognizing them. In this work, we propose to separate these tasks by relying on a CNN to first localize joints as 2D keypoints, and on self-attention between the CNN features at these keypoints to associate them with the corresponding hand joint. The resulting architecture, which we call \"Keypoint Transformer\", is highly efficient as it achieves state-of-the-art performance with roughly half the number of model parameters on the InterHand2.6M dataset. We also show it can be easily extended to estimate the 3D pose of an object manipulated by one or two hands with high performance. Moreover, we created a new dataset of more than 75,000 images of two hands manipulating an object fully annotated in 3D and will make it publicly available."}

However, since the latent codes of StyleGANs are designed to control global styles, it is hard to achieve a fine-grained control over synthesized images. We present SemanticStyleGAN, where a generator is trained to model local semantic parts separately and synthesizes images in a compositional way. The structure and texture of different local parts are controlled by corresponding latent codes. Experimental results demonstrate that our model provides a strong disentanglement between different spatial areas. When combined with editing methods designed for StyleGANs, it can achieve a more fine-grained control to edit synthesized or real images. The model can also be extended to other domains via transfer learning. Thus, as a generic prior model with built-in disentanglement, it could facilitate the development of GAN-based applications and enable more potential downstream tasks."}

To contribute to this quest, we propose VL-InterpreT, which provides novel interactive visualizations for interpreting the attentions and hidden representations in multimodal transformers. VL-InterpreT is a task agnostic and integrated tool that (1) tracks a variety of statistics in attention heads throughout all layers for both vision and language components, (2) visualizes cross-modal and intra-modal attentions through easily readable heatmaps, and (3) plots the hidden representations of vision and language tokens as they pass through the transformer layers.

Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) acquires the optimal architectures by optimizing the architecture parameters with gradient descent, which significantly reduces the search cost.

By contrast, we propose to evaluate the direct influence of operations on validation accuracy. To deal with the complex relationships between supernet components, we leverage Shapley value to quantify their marginal contributions by considering all possible combinations. Specifically, we iteratively optimize the supernet weights and update the architecture parameters by evaluating operation contributions via Shapley value, so that the optimal architectures are derived by selecting the operations that contribute significantly to the tasks. Since the exact computation of Shapley value is NP-hard, the Monte-Carlo sampling based algorithm with early truncation is employed for efficient approximation, and the momentum update mechanism is adopted to alleviate fluctuation of the sampling process.

Most previous works strive to achieve generalization through the meta-learning framework derived from classification tasks; however, the trained models are biased towards the seen classes instead of being ideally class-agnostic, thus hindering the recognition of new concepts.

Specifically, we apply an additional branch (base learner) to the conventional FSS model (meta learner) to explicitly identify the targets of base classes, i.e., the regions that do not need to be segmented. Then, the coarse results output by these two learners in parallel are adaptively integrated to yield precise segmentation prediction. Considering the sensitivity of meta learner, we further introduce an adjustment factor to estimate the scene differences between the input image pairs for facilitating the model ensemble forecasting. The substantial performance gains on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i verify the effectiveness, and surprisingly, our versatile scheme sets a new state-of-the-art even with two plain learners.

In this paper, we present a novel attention mechanism for pansharpening called HyperTransformer, in which features of LR-HSI and PAN are formulated as queries and keys in a transformer, respectively. HyperTransformer consists of three main modules, namely two separate feature extractors for PAN and HSI, a multi-head feature soft attention module, and a spatial-spectral feature fusion module. Such a network improves both spatial and spectral quality measures of the pansharpened HSI by learning cross-feature space dependencies and long-range details of PAN and LR-HSI.

To achieve this, we take advantage of text information extraction technologies to obtain event structural knowledge, and utilize multiple prompt functions to contrast difficult negative descriptions by manipulating event structures. We also design an event graph alignment loss based on optimal transport to capture event argument structures. In addition, we collect a large event-rich dataset (106,875 images) for pretraining, which provides a more challenging image retrieval benchmark to assess the understanding of complicated lengthy sentences. Experiments show that our zero-shot CLIP-Event outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model in argument extraction on Multimedia Event Extraction, achieving more than 5% absolute F-score gain in event extraction, as well as significant improvements on a variety of downstream tasks under zero-shot settings."}

Due to the ill-posed 2D to 3D mapping essence from the monocular imaging process, monocular 3D object detection suffers from inaccurate depth estimation and thus has poor 3D detection results. To alleviate this problem, we propose to introduce the ground plane as a prior in the monocular 3d object detection. The ground plane prior serves as an additional geometric condition to the ill-posed mapping and an extra source in depth estimation. In this way, we can get a more accurate depth estimation from the ground. Meanwhile, to take full advantage of the ground plane prior, we propose a depth-align training strategy and a precise two-stage depth inference method tailored for the ground plane prior. It is worth noting that the introduced ground plane prior requires no extra data sources like LiDAR, stereo images, and depth information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method could achieve state-of-the-art results compared with other methods while maintaining a very fast speed.

In this work, we think of videos of what they should be -- time-continuous signals, and extend the paradigm of neural representations to build a continuous-time video generator. For this, we first design continuous motion representations through the lens of positional embeddings. Then, we explore the question of training on very sparse videos and demonstrate that a good generator can be learned by using as few as 2 frames per clip. After that, we rethink the traditional image + video discriminators pair and design a holistic discriminator that aggregates temporal information by simply concatenating frames' features. This decreases the training cost and provides richer learning signal to the generator, making it possible to train directly on 1024x1024 videos for the first time. We build our model on top of StyleGAN2 and it is just 5% more expensive to train at the same resolution while achieving almost the same image quality. Moreover, our latent space features similar properties, enabling spatial manipulations that our method can propagate in time. We can generate arbitrarily long videos at arbitrary high frame rate, while prior work struggles to generate even 64 frames at a fixed rate. Our model is tested on four modern 256x256 and one 1024x1024-resolution video synthesis benchmarks. In terms of sheer metrics, it performs on average 30% better than the closest runner-up.

In spite of this, a model trained on source domain often fails to work properly in new challenging domains, that is directly concerned with the generalization capability of the model. In this paper, we present a novel memory-guided domain generalization method for semantic segmentation based on meta-learning framework. Especially, our method abstracts the conceptual knowledge of semantic classes into categorical memory which is constant beyond the domains. Upon the meta-learning concept, we repeatedly train memory-guided networks and simulate virtual test to 1) learn how to memorize a domain-agnostic and distinct information of classes and 2) offer an externally settled memory as a class-guidance to reduce the ambiguity of representation in the test data of arbitrary unseen domain. To this end, we also propose memory divergence and feature cohesion losses, which encourage to learn memory reading and update processes for category-aware domain generalization. Extensive experiments for semantic segmentation demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method over state-of-the-art works on various benchmarks."}

The model can capture accurate hand shape and appearance, generalize to arbitrary hand subjects, provide dense surface correspondences, be reconstructed from images in the wild and easily animated. We train LISA by minimizing the shape and appearance losses on a large set of multi-view RGB image sequences annotated with coarse 3D poses of the hand skeleton. For a 3D point in the hand local coordinate, our model predicts the color and the signed distance with respect to each hand bone independently, and then combines the per-bone predictions using predicted skinning weights. The shape, color and pose representations are disentangled by design, allowing to estimate or animate only selected parameters. We experimentally demonstrate that LISA can accurately reconstruct a dynamic hand from monocular or multi-view sequences, achieving a noticeably higher quality of reconstructed hand shapes compared to baseline approaches.

Existing INRs require point coordinates to learn the implicit level sets of the shape. When a normal vector is available for each point, a higher fidelity representation can be learned, however normal vectors are often not provided as raw data. Furthermore, the method's initialization has been shown to play a crucial role for surface reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a divergence guided shape representation learning approach that does not require normal vectors as input. We show that incorporating a soft constraint on the divergence of the distance function favours smooth solutions that reliably orients gradients to match the unknown normal at each point, in some cases even better than approaches that use ground truth normal vectors directly. Additionally, we introduce a novel geometric initialization method for sinusoidal INRs that further improves convergence to the desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of surface reconstruction and shape space learning and show SOTA performance compared to other unoriented methods."}

Current works model historical dependencies and anticipate the future to perceive the action evolution within a video segment and improve the detection accuracy. However, the existing paradigm ignores category-level modeling and does not pay sufficient attention to efficiency. Considering a category, its representative frames exhibit various characteristics. Thus, the category-level modeling can provide complimentary guidance to the temporal dependencies modeling. This paper develops an effective exemplar-consultation mechanism that first measures the similarity between a frame and exemplary frames, and then aggregates exemplary features based on the similarity weights. This is also an efficient mechanism, as both similarity measurement and feature aggregation require limited computations. Based on the exemplar-consultation mechanism, the long-term dependencies can be captured by regarding historical frames as exemplars, while the category-level modeling can be achieved by regarding representative frames from a category as exemplars. Due to the complementarity from the category-level modeling, our method employs a lightweight architecture but achieves new high performance on three benchmarks. In addition, using a spatio-temporal network to tackle video frames, our method makes a good trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.

To tackle this problem, some works design task-specific solutions by translating human understanding of the task to machine's learning process, which faces the risk of missing the optimal strategy since machines do not necessarily understand in the exact human way. Others try to use conventional task-agnostic approaches designed for domain generalization problems with no task prior knowledge considered. To solve the above issues, we propose AutoGPart, a generic method enabling training generalizable 3D part segmentation networks with the task prior considered. AutoGPart builds a supervision space with geometric prior knowledge encoded, and lets the machine to search for the optimal supervisions from the space for a specific segmentation task automatically. Extensive experiments on three generalizable 3D part segmentation tasks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of AutoGPart. We demonstrate that the performance of segmentation networks using simple backbones can be significantly improved when trained with supervisions searched by our method."}

Given the inherent coherence across consecutive frames, large parts of a video typically change little. By skipping identical image regions and truncating insignificant pixel updates, computational redundancy can in theory be reduced significantly. However, these theoretical savings have been difficult to translate into practice, as sparse updates hamper computational consistency and memory access coherence; which are key for efficiency on real hardware. With DeltaCNN, we present a sparse convolutional neural network framework that enables sparse frame-by-frame updates to accelerate video inference in practice. We provide sparse implementations for all typical CNN layers and propagate sparse feature updates end-to-end - without accumulating errors over time. DeltaCNN is applicable to all convolutional neural networks without retraining.

To tackle these issues, this work unsupervisedly learns a hierarchical low-rank tensor factorization (HLRTF) by solely using an observed multi-dimensional image. Specifically, we embed a deep neural network (DNN) into the tensor singular value decomposition framework and develop the HLRTF, which captures the underlying low-rank structures of multi-dimensional images with compact representation abilities. This DNN herein serves as a nonlinear transform from a vector to another to help obtain a better low-rank representation. Our HLRTF infers the parameters of the DNN and the underlying low-rank structure of the original data from its observation via the gradient descent using a non-reference loss function in an unsupervised manner. To address the vanishing gradient in extreme scenarios, e.g., structural missing pixels, we introduce a parametric total variation regularization to constrain the DNN parameters and the tensor factor parameters with theoretical analysis. We apply our HLRTF for typical inverse problems in multi-dimensional imaging including completion, denoising, and snapshot spectral imaging, which demonstrates its generality and wide applicability. Extensive results illustrate the superiority of our method as compared with state-of-the-art methods."}

Due to the unstructured and irregular nature of 3D object data, it is usually difficult to obtain high-quality surface details and geometry textures at a low cost. In this article, we propose an effective multimodal-driven deep neural network to perform 3D surface super-resolution in 2D normal domain, which is simple, accurate, and robust to the above difficulty. To leverage the multimodal information from different perspectives, we jointly consider the texture, depth, and normal modalities to simultaneously restore fine-grained surface details as well as preserve geometry structures. To better utilize the cross-modality information, we explore a two-bridge normal method with a transformer structure for feature alignment, and investigate an affine transform module for fusing multimodal features. Extensive experimental results on public and our newly constructed photometric stereo dataset demonstrate that the proposed method delivers promising surface geometry details compared with nine competitive schemes."}

Most previous learning-based plane reconstruction methods reconstruct 3D planes from single images, which highly rely on single-view regression and suffer from depth scale ambiguity. In contrast, we reconstruct 3D planes with a multi-view-stereo (MVS) pipeline that takes advantage of multi-view geometry. We decouple plane reconstruction into a semantic plane detection branch and a plane MVS branch. The semantic plane detection branch is based on a single-view plane detection framework but with differences. The plane MVS branch adopts a set of slanted plane hypotheses to replace conventional depth hypotheses to perform plane sweeping strategy and finally learns pixel-level plane parameters and its planar depth map. We present how the two branches are learned in a balanced way, and propose a soft-pooling loss to associate the outputs of the two branches and make them benefit from each other. Extensive experiments on various indoor datasets show that PlaneMVS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-view plane reconstruction methods on both plane detection and 3D geometry metrics. Our method even outperforms a set of SOTA learning-based MVS methods thanks to the learned plane priors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on 3D plane reconstruction within an end-to-end MVS framework."}

For practical use, an ideal post-processing refinement scheme are required to be accurate, generic and efficient. However, most of existing approaches propose pixel-wise refinement, which either introduce a massive computation cost or design specifically for different backbone models. Contour-based models are efficient and generic to be incorporated with any existing segmentation methods, but they often generate over-smoothed contour and tend to fail on corner areas. In this paper, we propose an efficient contour-based boundary refinement approach, named SharpContour, to tackle the segmentation of boundary area. We design a novel contour evolution process together with an Instance-aware Point Classifier. Our method deforms the contour iteratively by updating offsets in a discrete manner. Differing from existing contour evolution methods, SharpContour estimates each offset more independently so that it predicts much sharper and accurate contours. Notably, our method is generic to seamlessly work with diverse existing models with a small computational cost. Experiments show that SharpContour achieves competitive gains whilst preserving high efficiency."}

To develop a secure medical image analysis (MIA) system, it is a must to study possible backdoor attacks (BAs), which can embed hidden malicious behaviors into the system. However, designing a unified BA method that can be applied to various MIA systems is challenging due to the diversity of imaging modalities (e.g., X-Ray, CT, and MRI) and analysis tasks (e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation). Most existing BA methods are designed to attack natural image classification models, which apply spatial triggers to training images and inevitably corrupt the semantics of poisoned pixels, leading to the failures of attacking dense prediction models. To address this issue, we propose a novel Frequency-Injection based Backdoor Attack method (FIBA) that is capable of delivering attacks in various MIA tasks. Specifically, FIBA leverages a trigger function in the frequency domain that can inject the low-frequency information of a trigger image into the poisoned image by linearly combining the spectral amplitude of both images. Since it preserves the semantics of the poisoned image pixels, FIBA can perform attacks on both classification and dense prediction models. Experiments on three benchmarks in MIA (i.e., ISIC-2019 for skin lesion classification, KiTS-19 for kidney tumor segmentation, and EAD-2019 for endoscopic artifact detection), validate the effectiveness of FIBA and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in attacking MIA models as well as bypassing backdoor defense.

Compared to WSSS, WSIS requires instance-wise localization, which is difficult to extract from image-level labels. To tackle the problem, most WSIS approaches use off-the-shelf proposal techniques that require pre-training with instance or object level labels, deviating the fundamental definition of the fully-image-level supervised setting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach including two innovative components. First, we propose a semantic knowledge transfer to obtain pseudo instance labels by transferring the knowledge of WSSS to WSIS while eliminating the need for the off-the-shelf proposals. Second, we propose a self-refinement method to refine the pseudo instance labels in a self-supervised scheme and to use the refined labels for training in an online manner. Here, we discover an erroneous phenomenon, semantic drift, that occurred by the missing instances in pseudo instance labels categorized as background class. This semantic drift occurs confusion between background and instance in training and consequently degrades the segmentation performance. We term this problem as semantic drift problem and show that our proposed self-refinement method eliminates the semantic drift problem. The extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we achieve a considerable performance without off-the-shelf proposal techniques.

However, local details are gradually suppressed with the enlarging of receptive fields. Recently, vision transformer has shown excellent capability in capturing long-range dependencies. Inspired by this, we propose a novel transformer-based edge detector, Edge Detection TransformER (EDTER), to extract clear and crisp object boundaries and meaningful edges by exploiting the full image context information and detailed local cues simultaneously. EDTER works in two stages. In Stage I, a global transformer encoder is used to capture long-range global context on coarse-grained image patches. Then in Stage II, a local transformer encoder works on fine-grained patches to excavate the short-range local cues. Each transformer encoder is followed by an elaborately designed Bi-directional Multi-Level Aggregation decoder to achieve high-resolution features. Finally, the global context and local cues are combined by a Feature Fusion Module and fed into a decision head for edge prediction.

Traditional 3D watermarking approaches or commercial software are typically designed to embed messages into 3D meshes, and later retrieve the messages directly from distorted/undistorted watermarked 3D meshes. However, in many cases, users only have access to rendered 2D images instead of 3D meshes. Unfortunately, retrieving messages from 2D renderings of 3D meshes is still challenging and underexplored. We introduce a novel end-to-end learning framework to solve this problem through: 1) an encoder to covertly embed messages in both mesh geometry and textures; 2) a differentiable renderer to render watermarked 3D objects from different camera angles and under varied lighting conditions; 3) a decoder to recover the messages from 2D rendered images. From our experiments, we show that our model can learn to embed information visually imperceptible to humans, and to retrieve the embedded information from 2D renderings that undergo 3D distortions.

A key limitation of such methods, however, is that the output of the model is conditioned only on the object detector's outputs. The assumption that such outputs can represent all necessary information is unrealistic, especially when the detector is transferred across datasets. In this work, we reason about the graphical model induced by this assumption, and propose to add an auxiliary input to represent missing information such as object relationships. We specifically propose to mine attributes and relationships from the Visual Genome dataset and condition the captioning model on them. Crucially, we propose (and show to be important) the use of a multi-modal pre-trained model (CLIP) to retrieve such contextual descriptions. Further, the object detector outputs are fixed due to a frozen model and hence do not have sufficient richness to allow the captioning model to properly ground them. As a result, we propose to condition both the detector and description outputs on the image, and show qualitatively that this can improve grounding. We validate our method on image captioning, perform thorough analyses of each component and importance of the pre-trained multi-modal model, and demonstrate significant improvements over the current state of the art, specifically +7.5% in CIDEr and +1.3% in BLEU-4 metrics."}

Previous approaches have attempted to either track objects or generate descriptors for object identification.

In a robot exploration setup, there is a requirement for a temporally \"evolving\" global object representation built as the robot observes the object from multiple viewpoints. Furthermore, given the vast distribution of unknown novel objects in the real world, the object identification process must be class-agnostic. In this context, we propose a novel temporal 3D object encoding approach, dubbed AirObject, to obtain global keypoint graph-based embeddings of objects. Specifically, the global 3D object embeddings are generated using a temporal convolutional network across structural information of multiple frames obtained from a graph attention-based encoding method.

It benefits from the desirable property of the self-attention operation in Transformers which can naturally aggregate task-relevant features. Attentions from multiple levels of the Transformer, which focus on different regions of interest, are further combined to generate a global image representation. In addition, the output tokens from Transformer layers filtered by the fused attention mask are considered as key-patch descriptors, which are used to perform spatial matching to re-rank the candidates retrieved by the global image features.

This pipeline is partially motivated by recent progress in both object detection and re-ID, and partially motivated by biases in existing tracking datasets, where most objects tend to have distinguishing appearance and re-ID models are sufficient for establishing associations. In response to such bias, we would like to re-emphasize that methods for multi-object tracking should also work when object appearance is not sufficiently discriminative. To this end, we propose a large-scale dataset for multi-human tracking, where humans have similar appearance, diverse motion and extreme articulation. As the dataset contains mostly group dancing videos, we name it \"DanceTrack\". We expect DanceTrack to provide a better platform to develop more MOT algorithms that rely less on visual discrimination and depend more on motion analysis. We benchmark several state-of-the-art trackers on our dataset and observe a significant performance drop on DanceTrack when compared against existing benchmarks.

We provide a theoretical understanding of this vulnerability and relate it to an adversary's ability to misdirect the attention of all queries to a single key token under the control of the adversarial patch. We propose novel adversarial objectives for crafting adversarial patches which target this vulnerability explicitly. We show the effectiveness of the proposed patch attacks on popular image classification (ViTs and DeiTs) and object detection models (DETR).

In this setting, models operate on a huge output space, containing all possible state-object compositions. While previous works tackle the problem by learning embeddings for the compositions jointly,here we revisit a simple CZSL baseline and predict the primitives, i.e. states and objects, independently. To ensure that the model develops primitive-specific features, we equip the state and object classifiers with separate, non-linear feature extractors. Moreover, we estimate the feasibility of each composition through external knowledge, using this prior to remove unfeasible compositions from the output space.Finally, we propose a new setting, i.e. CZSL under partial supervision (pCZSL), where either only objects or state labels are available during training and we can use our prior to estimate the missing labels. Our model, Knowledge-Guided Simple Primitives (KG-SP), achieves the state of the art in both OW-CZSL and pCZSL, surpassing most recent competitors even when coupled with semi-supervised learning techniques"}

In the case of human action videos, however, where both appearance and motion are significant factors of variation, this gap remains significant [28,58]. One of the key reasons for this is that sampling pairs of similar video clips, a required step for many self-supervised contrastive learning methods, is currently done conservatively to avoid false positives. A typical assumption is that similar clips only occur temporally close within a single video, leading to insufficient examples of motion similarity. To mitigate this, we propose SLIC, a clustering-based self-supervised contrastive learning method for human action videos. Our key contribution is that we improve upon the traditional intra-video positive sampling by using iterative clustering to group similar video instances. This enables our method to leverage pseudo-labels from the cluster assignments to sample harder positives and negatives. SLIC outperforms state-of-the-art video retrieval baselines by +15.4% on top-1 recall on UCF101 and by +5.7% when directly transferred to HMDB51. With end-to-end finetuning for action classification, SLIC achieves 83.2% top-1 accuracy (+0.8%) on UCF101 and 54.5% on HMDB51 (+1.6%). SLIC is also competitive with the state-of-the-art in action classification after self-supervised pretraining on Kinetics400."}

Despite the recent progress, it remains challenging to deal with heterogeneous data clients, as the discrepant data distributions usually prevent the global model from delivering good generalization ability on each participating client. In this paper, we propose CD^2-pFed, a novel Cyclic Distillation-guided Channel Decoupling framework, to personalize the global model in FL, under various settings of data heterogeneity. Different from previous works which establish layer-wise personalization to overcome the non-IID data across different clients, we make the first attempt at channel-wise assignment for model personalization, referred to as channel decoupling. To further facilitate the collaboration between private and shared weights, we propose a novel cyclic distillation scheme to impose a consistent regularization between the local and global model representations during the federation. Guided by the cyclical distillation, our channel decoupling framework can deliver more accurate and generalized results for different kinds of heterogeneity, such as feature skew, label distribution skew, and concept shift. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmarks, including natural image and medical image analysis tasks, demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of our method on both local and external validations."}

In this scenario, anomaly detection is an open-set problem. However, some studies assimilate anomaly detection to action recognition. This is a closed-set scenario that fails to test the capability of systems at detecting new anomaly types. To this end, we propose UBnormal, a new supervised open-set benchmark composed of multiple virtual scenes for video anomaly detection. Unlike existing data sets, we introduce abnormal events annotated at the pixel level at training time, for the first time enabling the use of fully-supervised learning methods for abnormal event detection. To preserve the typical open-set formulation, we make sure to include disjoint sets of anomaly types in our training and test collections of videos. To our knowledge, UBnormal is the first video anomaly detection benchmark to allow a fair head-to-head comparison between one-class open-set models and supervised closed-set models, as shown in our experiments. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence showing that UBnormal can enhance the performance of a state-of-the-art anomaly detection framework on two prominent data sets, Avenue and ShanghaiTech. Our benchmark is freely available at https://github.com/lilygeorgescu/UBnormal."}

Existing methods often treat this problem as cross-view image retrieval, and use learned deep features to match the ground-level query image to a partition (e.g., a small patch) of the satellite map. By these methods, the localization accuracy is limited by the partitioning density of the satellite map (often in the order of tens meters). Departing from the conventional wisdom of image retrieval, this paper presents a novel solution that can achieve highly-accurate localization. The key idea is to formulate the task as pose estimation and solve it by neural-net based optimization. Specifically, we design a two-branch CNN to extract robust features from the ground and satellite images, respectively. To bridge the vast cross-view domain gap, we resort to a Geometry Projection module that projects features from the satellite map to the ground-view, based on a relative camera pose. Aiming to minimize the differences between the projected features and the observed features, we employ a differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) module to search for the optimal camera pose iteratively. The entire pipeline is differentiable and runs end-to-end. Extensive experiments on standard autonomous vehicle localization datasets have confirmed the superiority of the proposed method. Notably, e.g., starting from a coarse estimate of camera location within a wide region of 40m x 40m, with an 80% likelihood our method quickly reduces the lateral location error to be within 5m on a new KITTI cross-view dataset."}

A comprehensive understanding of articulated objects, namely appearance, structure, physics property, and semantics, will benefit many research communities. As current articulated object understanding solutions are usually based on synthetic object dataset with CAD models without physics properties, which prevent satisfied generalization from simulation to real-world applications in visual and robotics tasks. To bridge the gap, we present AKB-48: a large-scale Articulated object Knowledge Base which consists of 2,037 real-world 3D articulated object models of 48 categories. Each object is described by a knowledge graph ArtiKG. To build the AKB-48, we present a fast articulation knowledge modeling (FArM) pipeline, which can fulfill the ArtiKG for an articulated object within 10-15 minutes, and largely reduce the cost for object modeling in the real world. Using our dataset, we propose AKBNet, an integral pipeline for Category-level Visual Articulation Manipulation (C-VAM) task, in which we benchmark three sub-tasks, namely pose estimation, object reconstruction and manipulation.

Motion style transfer algorithms are often designed for offline settings where motions are processed in segments. However, for online animation applications, such as real-time avatar animation from motion capture, motions need to be processed as a stream with minimal latency. In this work, we realize a flexible, high-quality motion style transfer method for this setting. We propose a novel style transfer model, Style-ERD, to stylize motions in an online manner with an Encoder-Recurrent-Decoder structure, along with a novel discriminator that combines feature attention and temporal attention. Our method stylizes motions into multiple target styles with a unified model. Although our method targets online settings, it outperforms previous offline methods in motion realism and style expressiveness and provides significant gains in runtime efficiency."}

In essence, this strategy ignores the fact that two crops may truly contain different image information, e.g., background and small objects, and thus tends to restrain the diversity of the learned representations. In this work, we address this issue by introducing a new self-supervised learning strategy, LoGo, that explicitly reasons about  Lo cal and  G l o bal crops. To achieve view invariance, LoGo encourages similarity between global crops from the same image, as well as between a global and a local crop. However, to correctly encode the fact that the content of smaller crops may differ entirely, LoGo promotes two local crops to have dissimilar representations, while being close to global crops. Our LoGo strategy can easily be applied to existing SSL methods. Our extensive experiments on a variety of datasets and using different self-supervised learning frameworks validate its superiority over existing approaches. Noticeably, we achieve better results than supervised models on transfer learning when using only 1/10 of the data."}

Like most view synthesis methods, NeRF uses tonemapped low dynamic range (LDR) as input; these images have been processed by a lossy camera pipeline that smooths detail, clips highlights, and distorts the simple noise distribution of raw sensor data. We modify NeRF to instead train directly on linear raw images, preserving the scene's full dynamic range. By rendering raw output images from the resulting NeRF, we can perform novel high dynamic range (HDR) view synthesis tasks. In addition to changing the camera viewpoint, we can manipulate focus, exposure, and tonemapping after the fact. Although a single raw image appears significantly more noisy than a postprocessed one, we show that NeRF is highly robust to the zero-mean distribution of raw noise. When optimized over many noisy raw inputs (25-200), NeRF produces a scene representation so accurate that its rendered novel views outperform dedicated single and multi-image deep raw denoisers run on the same wide baseline input images. As a result, our method, which we call RawNeRF, can reconstruct scenes from extremely noisy images captured in near-darkness."}

Existing learning-based methods rely heavily on expensive point-wise annotations. To alleviate this problem, we are the first to explore a low-cost annotation way for 3D tooth instance segmentation, i.e., labeling all tooth centroids and only a few teeth for each dental model. Regarding the challenge when only weak annotation is provided, we present a dental arch prior-assisted 3D tooth segmentation method, namely DArch. Our DArch consists of two stages, including tooth centroid detection and tooth instance segmentation. Accurately detecting the tooth centroids can help locate the individual tooth, thus benefiting the segmentation. Thus, our DArch proposes to leverage the dental arch prior to assist the detection. Specifically, we firstly propose a coarse-to-fine method to estimate the dental arch, in which the dental arch is initially generated by Bezier curve regression and then a lightweight network is trained to refine it. With the estimated dental arch, we then propose a novel Arch-aware Point Sampling (APS) method to assist the tooth centroid proposal generation. Meantime, a segmentor is independently trained using a patch-based training strategy, aiming to segment a tooth instance from a 3D patch centered at the tooth centroid. Experimental results on 4,773 dental models have shown our DArch can accurately segment each tooth of a dental model, and its performance is superior to the state-of-the-art methods."}

However, when interpolating novel views, NeRF often yields inconsistent and visually non-smooth geometric results, which we consider as a generalization gap between seen and unseen views. Recent advances in convolutional neural networks have demonstrated the promise of advanced robust data augmentations, either random or learned, in enhancing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization. Inspired by that, we propose Augmented NeRF (Aug-NeRF), which for the first time brings the power of robust data augmentations into regularizing the NeRF training. Particularly, our proposal learns to seamlessly blend worst-case perturbations into three distinct levels of the NeRF pipeline with physical grounds, including (1) the input coordinates, to simulate imprecise camera parameters at image capture; (2) intermediate features, to smoothen the intrinsic feature manifold; and (3) pre-rendering output, to account for the potential degradation factors in the multi-view image supervision. Extensive results demonstrate that Aug-NeRF effectively boosts NeRF performance in both novel view synthesis (up to 1.5 dB PSNR gain) and underlying geometry reconstruction. Furthermore, thanks to the implicit smooth prior injected by the triple-level augmentations, Aug-NeRF can even recover scenes from heavily corrupted images, a highly challenging setting untackled before. Our codes are available in https://github.com/VITA-Group/Aug-NeRF."}

Purposely, we introduce a novel RGB-MS dataset framing 13 different scenes in indoor environments and providing a total of 34 image pairs annotated with semi-dense, high-resolution ground-truth labels in the form of disparity maps. To tackle the task, we propose a deep learning architecture trained in a self-supervised manner by exploiting a further RGB camera, required only during training data acquisition. In this setup, we can conveniently learn cross-modal matching in the absence of ground-truth labels by distilling knowledge from an easier RGB-RGB matching task based on a collection of about 11K unlabeled image triplets. Experiments show that the proposed pipeline sets a good performance bar (1.16 pixels average registration error) for future research on this novel, challenging task."}

We introduce a method that uses visual observations to bridge the gap between languages, rather than relying on parallel corpora or topological properties of the representations. We train a model that aligns segments of text from different languages if and only if the images associated with them are similar and each image in turn is well-aligned with its textual description. We train our model from scratch on a new dataset of text in over fifty languages with accompanying images. Experiments show that our method outperforms previous work on unsupervised word and sentence translation using retrieval."}

It is based on the finding that gradients from incomplete execution for backpropagation can still effectively train the models with minimal accuracy loss, which attributes to the high redundancy of video. SBP keeps all forward paths but randomly and independently removes the backward paths for each network layer in each training step. It reduces the GPU memory cost by eliminating the need to cache activation values corresponding to the dropped backward paths, whose amount can be controlled by an adjustable keep-ratio. Experiments show that SBP can be applied to a wide range of models for video tasks, leading to up to 80.0% GPU memory saving and 10% training speedup with less than 1% accuracy drop on action recognition and temporal action detection."}

However, existing studies show that the pretrained model using a single benchmark dataset is not generalized to various target datasets. More importantly, the pretrained model can be vulnerable to copyright or privacy risks as membership inference attack advances. To resolve both issues, we propose an effective and unbiased data synthesizer, namely Primitives-PS, inspired by the generic characteristics of natural images. Specifically, we utilize 1) the generic statistics on the frequency magnitude spectrum, 2) the elementary shape (i.e., image composition via elementary shapes) for representing the structure information, and 3) the existence of saliency as prior. Since our synthesizer only considers the generic properties of natural images, the single model pretrained on our dataset can be consistently transferred to various target datasets, and even outperforms the previous methods pretrained with the natural images in terms of Fr'echet inception distance. Extensive analysis, ablation study, and evaluations demonstrate that each component of our data synthesizer is effective and provide insights on the desirable nature of the pretrained model for the transferability of GANs."}
