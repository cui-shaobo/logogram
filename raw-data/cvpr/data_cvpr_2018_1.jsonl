We train a deep convolutional network that learns to map image regions to the full 3D shape and pose of all object instances in the image. Our method produces a compact 3D representation of the scene, which can be readily used for applications like autonomous driving. Many traditional 2D vision outputs, like instance segmentations and depth-maps, can be obtained by simply rendering our output 3D scene model. We exploit class-specific shape priors by learning a low dimensional shape-space from collections of CAD models. We present novel representations of shape and pose, that strive towards better 3D equivariance and generalization. In order to exploit rich supervisory signals in the form of 2D annotations like segmentation, we propose a differentiable Render-and-Compare loss that allows 3D shape and pose to be learned with 2D supervision. We evaluate our method on the challenging real-world datasets of Pascal3D+ and KITTI, where we achieve state-of-the-art results."}

We propose VizWiz, the first goal-oriented VQA dataset arising from a natural VQA setting.  VizWiz consists of 31,000 visual questions originating from blind people who each took a picture using a mobile phone and recorded a spoken question about it, together with 10 crowdsourced answers per visual question.  VizWiz differs from the many existing VQA datasets because (1) images are captured by blind photographers and so are often poor quality, (2) questions are spoken and so are more conversational, and (3) often visual questions cannot be answered.  Evaluation of modern algorithms for answering visual questions and deciding if a visual question is answerable reveals that VizWiz is a challenging dataset.  We introduce this dataset to encourage a larger community to develop more generalized algorithms that can assist blind people."}

The major difficulty stems from the large diversity in the way people appear in crowds. In fact, features available for crowd discrimination largely depend on the crowd density to the extent that people are only seen as blobs in a highly dense scene. We tackle this problem with a growing CNN which can progressively increase its capacity to account for the wide variability seen in crowd scenes. Our model starts from a base CNN density regressor, which is trained in equivalence on all types of crowd images. In order to adapt with the huge diversity, we create two child regressors which are exact copies of the base CNN. A differential training procedure divides the dataset into two clusters and fine-tunes the child networks on their respective specialties. Consequently, without any hand-crafted criteria for forming specialties, the child regressors become experts on certain types of crowds. The child networks are again split recursively, creating two experts at every division. This hierarchical training leads to a CNN tree, where the child regressors are more fine experts than any of their parents. The leaf nodes are taken as the final experts and a classifier network is then trained to predict the correct specialty for a given test image patch. The proposed model achieves higher count accuracy on major crowd datasets. Further, we analyse the characteristics of specialties mined automatically by our method."}

In this paper, we revisit these approaches by considering, additionally, the memory constraint required to index billions of images on a single server. This leads us to propose a method based both on graph traversal and compact representations. We encode the indexed vectors using quantization and exploit the graph structure to refine the similarity estimation.   In essence, our method takes the best of these two worlds: the search strategy is based on nested graphs, thereby providing high precision with a relatively small set of comparisons. At the same time it offers a significant memory compression. As a result, our approach outperforms the state of the art on operating points considering 64--128 bytes per vector, as demonstrated by our results on two billion-scale public benchmarks."}

It is a dream that remains stubbornly distant. However, recent advances in vision and language methods have made incredible progress in closely related areas. This is significant because a robot interpreting a natural-language navigation instruction on the basis of what it sees is carrying out a vision and language process that is similar to Visual Question Answering.  Both tasks can be interpreted as visually grounded sequence-to-sequence translation problems, and many of the same methods are applicable. To enable and encourage the application of vision and language methods to the problem of interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions, we present the Matterport3D Simulator -- a large-scale reinforcement learning environment based on real imagery. Using this simulator, which can in future support a range of embodied vision and language tasks, we provide the first benchmark dataset for visually-grounded natural language navigation in real buildings -- the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset."}

For instance, could having surface normals simplify estimating the depth of an image? Intuition answers these questions positively, implying existence of a structure among visual tasks. Knowing this structure has notable uses; it is the concept underlying transfer learning and, for example, can provide a principled way for reusing supervision among related tasks, finding what tasks transfer well to an arbitrary target task, or solving many tasks in one system without piling up the complexity.      This paper proposes a fully computational approach for finding the structure of the space of visual tasks. This is done via a sampled dictionary of twenty six 2D, 2.5D, 3D, and semantic tasks, and modeling their (1st and higher order) transfer dependencies in a latent space. The product can be viewed as a computational taxonomic map for task transfer learning. We study the consequences of this structure, e.g. the nontrivial emerged relationships, and exploit them to reduce the demand for labeled data. For example, we show that the total number of labeled datapoints needed for solving a set of 10 tasks can be reduced by roughly 2/3 while keeping the performance nearly the same. Users can employ a provided Binary Integer Programming solver that leverages the taxonomy to find efficient supervision policies for their own use cases."}

Previous approaches showcase the inability of even deep neural networks to learn informative representations across domain shift. This problem is more severe for tasks where acquiring hand labeled data is extremely hard and tedious. In this work, we focus on adapting the representations learned by segmentation networks across synthetic and real domains. Contrary to previous approaches that use a simple adversarial objective or superpixel information to aid the process, we propose an approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that brings the embeddings closer in the learned feature space. To showcase the generality and scalability of our approach, we show that we can achieve state of the art results on two challenging scenarios of synthetic to real domain adaptation. Additional exploratory experiments show that our approach: (1) generalizes to unseen domains and (2) results in improved alignment of source and target distributions."}

To make this possible, Im2Pano3D leverages strong contextual priors learned from large-scale synthetic and real-world indoor scenes. To ease the prediction of 3D structure, we propose to parameterize 3D surfaces with their plane equations and train the model to predict these parameters directly. To provide meaningful training supervision, we make use of multiple loss functions that consider both pixel level accuracy and global context consistency. Experiments demonstrate that Im2Pano3D is able to predict the semantics and 3D structure of the unobserved scene with more than 56% pixel accuracy and less than 0.52m average distance error, which is significantly better than alternative approaches."}

Recent methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) allow learning the entire task from data. However, they do not incorporate the physics of image formation such as perspective geometry and occlusion. Instead, classical approaches based on Markov Random Fields (MRF) with ray-potentials explicitly model these physical processes, but they cannot cope with large surface appearance variations across different viewpoints. In this paper, we propose RayNet, which combines the strengths of both frameworks. RayNet integrates a CNN that learns view-invariant feature representations with an MRF that explicitly encodes the physics of perspective projection and occlusion. We train RayNet end-to-end using empirical risk minimization. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on challenging real-world datasets and demonstrate its benefits over a piece-wise trained baseline, hand-crafted models as well as other learning-based approaches."}

We describe a system designed to provide detailed 3D reconstructions of faces viewed under extreme conditions, out of plane rotations, and occlusions. Motivated by the concept of bump mapping, we propose a layered approach which decouples estimation of a global shape from its mid-level details (e.g., wrinkles). We estimate a coarse 3D face shape which acts as a foundation and then separately layer this foundation with details represented by a bump map. We show how a deep convolutional encoder-decoder can be used to estimate such bump maps. We further show how this approach naturally extends to generate plausible details for occluded facial regions. We test our approach and its components extensively, quantitatively demonstrating the invariance of our estimated facial details. We further provide numerous qualitative examples showing that our method produces detailed 3D face shapes in viewing conditions where existing state of the art often break down."}

These robust methods often rely on running minimal solvers in a RANSAC framework. In this paper we show how we can make polynomial solvers based on the action matrix method faster, by careful selection of the monomial bases. These monomial bases have traditionally been based on a Grobner basis for the polynomial ideal. Here we describe how we can enumerate all such bases in an efficient way. We also show that going beyond Grobner bases leads to more efficient solvers in many cases. We present a novel basis sampling scheme that we evaluate on a number of problems."}

Modeling 3D animal shape, however, is difficult because the 3D scanning methods used to capture human shape are not applicable to wild animals or natural settings. Consequently, we propose a method to capture the detailed 3D shape of animals from images alone. The articulated and deformable nature of animals makes this problem extremely challenging, particularly in unconstrained environments with moving and uncalibrated cameras. To make this possible, we use a strong prior model of articulated animal shape that we fit to the image data. We then deform the animal shape in a canonical reference pose such that it matches image evidence when articulated and projected into multiple images. Our method extracts significantly more 3D shape detail than previous methods and is able to model new species, including the shape of an extinct animal, using only a few video frames. Additionally, the projected 3D shapes are accurate enough to facilitate the extraction of a realistic texture map from multiple frames."}

Whereas in practical scenario, labeled instances are typically collected from diverse sources. Moreover, those sources may not completely share their categories, which further brings a category shift challenge to multi-source (unsupervised) domain adaptation (MDA). In this paper, we propose a deep cocktail network (DCTN), to battle the domain and category shifts among multiple sources. Motivated by the theoretical results in cite{mansour2009domain}, the target distribution can be represented as the weighted combination of source distributions, and, the training of MDA via DCTN is then performed as two alternating steps: i) It deploys multi-way adversarial learning to minimize the discrepancy between the target and each of the multiple source domains, which also obtains the source-specific perplexity scores to denote the possibilities that a target sample belongs to different source domains. ii) The multi-source category classifiers are integrated with the perplexity scores to classify target sample, and the pseudo-labeled target samples together with source samples are utilized to update the multi-source category classifier and the representation module. We evaluate DCTN in three domain adaptation benchmarks, which clearly demonstrate the superiority of our framework."}

Although the past decade has witnessed major advances in object detection in natural scenes, such successes have been slow to aerial imagery, not only because of the huge variation in the scale, orientation and shape of the object instances on the earth's surface, but also due to the scarcity of well-annotated datasets of objects in aerial scenes. To advance object detection research in Earth Vision, also known as Earth Observation and Remote Sensing, we introduce a large-scale Dataset for Object deTection in Aerial images (DOTA).  To this end, we collect 2806 aerial images from different sensors and platforms. Each image is of the size about 4000-by-4000 pixels and contains objects exhibiting a wide variety of scales, orientations, and shapes. These DOTA images are then annotated by experts in aerial image interpretation using 15 common object categories. The fully annotated DOTA images contains 188,282 instances, each of which is labeled by an arbitrary (8 d.o.f.) quadrilateral. To build a baseline for object detection in Earth Vision, we evaluate state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on DOTA. Experiments demonstrate that DOTA well represents real Earth Vision applications and are quite challenging."}

Combined with a textual path which is jointly trained from scratch, our semantic-visual embedding offers a versatile model. Once trained under the supervision of captioned images, it yields new state-of-the-art performance on cross-modal retrieval. It also allows the localization of new concepts from the embedding space into any input image, delivering state-of-the-art result on the visual grounding of phrases."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2018", "Area": "CV", "Where": "CVPR", "Abbreviation": "Feature Super-Resolution", "Title": "Make Machine See More Clearly", "Abstract": "Identifying small size images or small objects is a notoriously challenging problem, as discriminative representations are difficult to learn from the limited information contained in them with poor-quality appearance and unclear object structure. Existing research works usually increase the resolution of low-resolution image in the pixel space in order to provide better visual quality for human viewing. However, the improved performance of such methods is usually limited or even trivial in the case of very small image size (we will show it in this paper explicitly).  In this paper, different from image super-resolution (ISR), we propose a novel super-resolution technique called feature super-resolution (FSR), which aims at enhancing the discriminatory power of small size image in order to provide high recognition precision for machine. To achieve this goal, we propose a new Feature Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (FSR-GAN) model that transforms the raw poor features of small size images to highly discriminative ones by performing super-resolution in the feature space. Our FSR-GAN consists of two subnetworks: a feature generator network G and a feature discriminator network D. By training the G and the D networks in an alternative manner, we encourage the G network to discover the latent distribution correlations between small size and large size images and then use G to improve the representations of small images. Extensive experiment results on Oxford5K, Paris, Holidays, and Flick100k datasets demonstrate that the proposed FSR approach can effectively enhance the discriminatory ability of features. Even when the resolution of query images is reduced greatly, e.g., 1/64 original size, the query feature enhanced by our FSR approach achieves surprisingly high retrieval performance at different image resolutions and increases the retrieval precision by 25% compared to the raw query feature."}

WAMI proposes a number of unique challenges including extremely small object sizes, both sparse and densely-packed objects, and extremely large search spaces (large video frames). Nearly all state-of-the-art methods in WAMI object detection report that appearance-based classifiers fail in this challenging data and instead rely almost entirely on motion information in the form of background subtraction or frame-differencing. In this work, we experimentally verify the failure of appearance-based classifiers in WAMI, such as Faster R-CNN and a heatmap-based fully convolutional neural network (CNN), and propose a novel two-stage spatio-temporal CNN which effectively and efficiently combines both appearance and motion information to significantly surpass the state-of-the-art in WAMI object detection. To reduce the large search space, the first stage (ClusterNet) takes in a set of extremely large video frames, combines the motion and appearance information within the convolutional architecture, and proposes regions of objects of interest (ROOBI). These ROOBI can contain from one to clusters of several hundred objects due to the large video frame size and varying object density in WAMI. The second stage (FoveaNet) then estimates the centroid location of all objects in that given ROOBI simultaneously via heatmap estimation. The proposed method exceeds state-of-the-art results on the WPAFB 2009 dataset by 5-16% for moving objects and nearly 50% for stopped objects, as well as being the first proposed method in wide area motion imagery to detect completely stationary objects."}

Towards this goal, we present a model, called MaskLab, which produces three outputs: box detection, semantic segmentation, and direction prediction. Building on top of the Faster-RCNN object detector, the predicted boxes provide accurate localization of object instances. Within each region of interest, MaskLab performs foreground/background segmentation by combining semantic and direction prediction. Semantic segmentation assists the model in distinguishing between objects of different semantic classes including background, while the direction prediction, estimating each pixel's direction towards its corresponding center, allows separating instances of the same semantic class. Moreover, we explore the effect of incorporating recent successful methods from both segmentation and detection (eg, atrous convolution and hypercolumn). Our proposed model is evaluated on the COCO instance segmentation benchmark and shows comparable performance with other state-of-art models."}

IQA presents the agent with a scene and a question, like: “Are there any apples in the fridge?” The agent must navigate around the scene, acquire visual understanding of scene elements, interact with objects (e.g. open refrigerators) and plan for a series of actions conditioned on the question. Popular reinforcement learning approaches with a single controller perform poorly on IQA owing to the large and diverse state space. We propose the Hierarchical Interactive Memory Network (HIMN), consisting of a factorized set of controllers, allowing the system to operate at multiple levels of temporal abstraction. To evaluate HIMN, we introduce IQUAD V1, a new dataset built upon AI2-THOR [35], a simulated photo-realistic environment of configurable indoor scenes with interactive objects. IQUAD V1 has 75,000 questions, each paired with a unique scene configuration. Our experiments show that our proposed model outperforms popular single controller based methods on IQUAD V1.

Omni-supervised learning is lower-bounded by performance on existing labeled datasets, offering the potential to surpass state-of-the-art fully supervised methods. To exploit the omni-supervised setting, we propose data distillation, a method that ensembles predictions from multiple transformations of unlabeled data, using a single model, to automatically generate new training annotations. We argue that visual recognition models have recently become accurate enough that it is now possible to apply classic ideas about self-training to challenging real-world data. Our experimental results show that in the cases of human keypoint detection and general object detection, state-of-the-art models trained with data distillation surpass the performance of using labeled data from the COCO dataset alone."}

To tackle this problem, we propose a unified diagram-parsing network for generating knowledge from diagrams based on an object detector and a recurrent neural network designed for a graphical structure. Specifically, we propose a dynamic graph-generation network that is based on dynamic memory and graph theory. We explore the dynamics of information in a diagram with activation of gates in gated recurrent unit (GRU) cells. On publicly available diagram datasets, our model demonstrates a state-of-the-art result that outperforms other baselines.

There are a great many practical applications where the subjects that may be of interest are not known beforehand, or so easily delineated, however. In many of these cases natural language dialog is a natural way to specify the subject of interest, and the task achieving this capability (a.k.a, Referring Expression Comprehension) has recently attracted attention.To this end we propose a unified framework, the ParalleL AttentioN (PLAN) network, to discover the object in an image that is being referred to in variable length natural expression descriptions, from short phrases query to long multi-round dialogs. The PLAN network has two attention mechanisms that relate parts of the expressions to both the global visual content and also directly to object candidates. Furthermore, the attention mechanisms are recurrent, making the referring process visualizable and explainable. The attended information from these dual sources are combined to reason about the referred object. These two attention mechanisms can be trained in parallel and we find the combined system outperforms the state-of-art on several benchmarked datasets with different length language input, such as RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and GuessWhat?!."}

An efficient way to reduce this complexity is to quantize the weight parameters and/or activations during training by approximating their distributions with a limited entry codebook. For very low-precisions, such as binary or ternary networks with 1-8-bit activations, the information loss from quantization leads to significant accuracy degradation due to large gradient mismatches between the forward and backward functions. In this paper, we introduce a quantization method to reduce this loss by learning a symmetric codebook for particular weight subgroups. These subgroups are determined based on their locality in the weight matrix, such that the hardware simplicity of the low-precision representations is preserved. Empirically, we show that symmetric quantization can substantially improve accuracy for networks with extremely low-precision weights and activations. We also demonstrate that this representation imposes minimal or no hardware implications to more coarse-grained approaches. Source code is available at https://www.github.com/julianfaraone/SYQ."}

Specifically, our PointNetVLAD is a combination/modification of the existing PointNet and NetVLAD, which allows end-to-end training and inference to extract the global descriptor from a given 3D point cloud. Furthermore, we propose the \"lazy triplet and quadruplet\" loss functions that can achieve more discriminative and generalizable global descriptors to tackle the retrieval task. We create benchmark datasets for point cloud based retrieval for place recognition, and the experimental results on these datasets show the feasibility of our PointNetVLAD."}

To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN), most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically, VoxelNet divides a point cloud into equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a descriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to generate detections. Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that VoxelNet outperforms  the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a large margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative  representation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging results in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR."}

We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call mbox{SSDLite}. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of mbox{DeepLabv3} which we call Mobile mbox{DeepLabv3}.   is based on an inverted residual structure where the shortcut connections are between the thin bottleneck layers. The intermediate expansion layer uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features as a source of non-linearity.  Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design.  Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which  provides a convenient framework for further analysis.

Given a single 2D image with an object depicted, our goal is automatically recover a cuboid structure of the object parts as well as their mutual relations. We develop a convolutional-recursive auto-encoder comprised of structure parsing of a 2D image followed by structure recovering of a cuboid hierarchy. The encoder is achieved by a multi-scale convolutional network trained with the task of shape contour estimation, thereby learning to discern object structures in various forms and scales. The decoder fuses the features of the structure parsing network and the original image, and recursively decodes a hierarchy of cuboids. Since the decoder network is learned to recover part relations including connectivity and symmetry explicitly, the plausibility and generality of part structure recovery can be ensured. The two networks are jointly trained using the training data of contour-mask and cuboid-structure pairs. Such pairs are generated by rendering stock 3D CAD models coming with part segmentation. Our method achieves unprecedentedly faithful and detailed recovery of diverse 3D part structures from single-view 2D images. We demonstrate two applications of our method including structure-guided completion of 3D volumes reconstructed from single-view images and structure-aware interactive editing of 2D images."}

Our main contribution is a new way to handle occlusions which improves general accuracy and quality of object borders. In contrast to all prior work we work with a model which directly incorporates both depth and occlusion, using a local optimization scheme based on the PatchMatch algorithm. The key benefit of this joint approach is that we utilize all available data, and not erroneously discard valuable information in pre-processing steps. We see the benefit of our approach not only at improved object boundaries, but also at smooth surface reconstruction, where we outperform even methods which focus on good surface regularization. We have evaluated our method on a public light-field dataset, where we achieve state-of-the-art results in nine out of twelve error metrics, with a close tie for the remaining three."}

The key contribution of our method is its ability to handle large scenes with varying spatial extent, managing the cubic growth in data size as scene size increases. To this end, we devise a fully-convolutional generative 3D CNN model whose filter kernels are invariant to the overall scene size. The model can be trained on scene subvolumes but deployed on arbitrarily large scenes at test time. In addition, we propose a coarse-to-fine inference strategy in order to produce high-resolution output while also leveraging large input context sizes. In an extensive series of experiments, we carefully evaluate different model design choices, considering both deterministic and probabilistic models for completion and semantic inference. Our results show that we outperform other methods not only in the size of the environments handled and processing efficiency, but also with regard to completion quality and semantic segmentation performance by a significant margin."}

By estimating all parameters from just a single image, advanced editing possibilities on a single face image, such as appearance editing and relighting, become feasible in real time. Most previous learning-based face reconstruction approaches do not jointly recover all dimensions, or are severely limited in terms of visual quality. In contrast, we propose to recover high-quality facial pose, shape, expression, reflectance and illumination using a deep neural network that is trained using a large, synthetically created training corpus. Our approach builds on a novel loss function that measures model-space similarity directly in parameter space and significantly improves reconstruction accuracy.We further propose a self-supervised bootstrapping process in the network training loop, which iteratively updates the synthetic training corpus to better reflect the distribution of real-world imagery. We demonstrate that this strategy outperforms completely synthetically trained networks. Finally, we show high-quality reconstructions and compare our approach to several state-of-the-art approaches."}

We propose a stacked U-Net with intermediate supervision to directly predict the forward mapping from a distorted image to its rectified version. Because large-scale real-world data with ground truth deformation is difficult to obtain, we create a synthetic dataset with approximately 100 thousand images by warping non-distorted document images.

High-resolution aerial imagery provides a promising avenue to automatically infer a road network. Prior work uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect which pixels belong to a road (segmentation), and then uses complex post-processing heuristics to infer graph connectivity. We show that these segmentation methods have high error rates because noisy CNN outputs are difficult to correct. We propose RoadTracer, a new method to automatically construct accurate road network maps from aerial images. RoadTracer uses an iterative search process guided by a CNN-based decision function to derive the road network graph directly from the output of the CNN. We compare our approach with a segmentation method on fifteen cities, and find that at a 5% error rate, RoadTracer correctly captures 45% more junctions across these cities."}

Specifically, the proposed system triggers the left-right cameras in an alternating fashion, estimates the poses corresponding to the left camera only, and introduces a linear interpolation model for processing the alternating right camera measurements.  Although not a regular stereo system, the alternating visual observations when employing the proposed interpolation scheme, still provide scale information, as shown by analyzing the observability properties of the vision-only corresponding system. Finally, the performance gain, of the proposed algorithm over its monocular and stereo counterparts is assessed using various datasets."}

Due to its property, one can compute the depth from light fields in uncontrolled lighting environments, which is a big advantage over active sensing devices. Depth computed from light fields can be used for many applications including 3D modelling and refocusing. However, light field images from hand-held cameras have very narrow baselines with noise, making the depth estimation difficult. Many approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations for the light field depth estimation, but there is a clear trade-off between the accuracy and the speed in these methods. In this paper, we introduce a fast and accurate light field depth estimation method based on a fully-convolutional neural network. Our network is designed by considering the light field geometry and we also overcome the lack of training data by proposing light field specific data augmentation methods. We achieved the top rank in the HCI 4D Light Field Benchmark on most metrics, and we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on real-world light-field images."}

However, it is still difficult to adapt an offline trained model to a target tracked online. This work presents a Residual Attentional Siamese Network (RASNet) for high performance object tracking. The RASNet model reformulates the correlation filter within a Siamese tracking framework, and introduces different kinds of the attention mechanisms to adapt the model without updating the model online. In particular, by exploiting the offline trained general attention, the target adapted residual attention, and the channel favored feature attention, the RASNet not only mitigates the over-fitting problem in deep network training, but also enhances its discriminative capacity and adaptability due to the separation of representation learning and discriminator learning. The proposed deep architecture is trained from end to end and takes full advantage of the rich spatial temporal information to achieve robust visual tracking. Experimental results on two latest benchmarks, OTB-2015 and VOT2017, show that the RASNet tracker has the state-of-the-art tracking accuracy while runs at more than 80 frames per second."}

In this paper, we propose to generate hard positive samples via adversarial learning for visual tracking. Speciﬁcally speaking, we assume the target objects all lie on a manifold, hence, we introduce the positive samples generation network (PSGN) to sampling massive diverse training data through traversing over the constructed target object manifold. The generated diverse target object images can enrich the training dataset and enhance the robustness of visual trackers. To make the tracker more robust to occlusion, we adopt the hard positive transformation network (HPTN) which can generate hard samples for tracking algorithm to recognize.

First, we introduce a new benchmark for predicting human eye movements during dynamic scene free-viewing, which is long-time urged in this field. Our dataset, named DHF1K~(Dynamic Human Fixation), consists of 1K high-quality, elaborately selected video sequences spanning a large range of scenes, motions, object types and background complexity. Existing video saliency datasets lack variety and generality of common dynamic scenes and fall short in covering challenging situations in unconstrained environments. In contrast, DHF1K~makes a significant leap in terms of scalability, diversity and difficulty, and is expected to boost video saliency modeling. Second, we propose a novel video saliency model that augments the CNN-LSTM network architecture with an attention mechanism to enable fast, end-to-end saliency learning. The attention mechanism explicitly encodes static saliency information, thus allowing LSTM to focus on learning more flexible temporal saliency representation across successive frames. Such a design fully leverages existing large-scale static fixation datasets, avoids overfitting, and significantly improves training efficiency and testing performance. We thoroughly examine the performance of our model, with respect to state-of-the-art saliency models, on three large-scale datasets (i.e., DHF1K, Hollywood2, UCF sports). Experimental results over more than 1.2K testing videos containing 400K frames demonstrate that our model outperforms other competitors."}

Recently, modular networks have been shown to be an effective framework for performing visual reasoning tasks. While modular networks were initially designed with a degree of model transparency, their performance on complex visual reasoning benchmarks was lacking. Current state-of-the-art approaches do not provide an effective mechanism for understanding the reasoning process. In this paper, we close the performance gap between interpretable models and state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods. We propose a set of visual-reasoning primitives which, when composed, manifest as a model capable of performing complex reasoning tasks in an explicitly-interpretable manner. The fidelity and interpretability of the primitives’ outputs enable an unparalleled ability to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of the resulting model. Critically, we show that these primitives are highly performant, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.1% on the CLEVR dataset. We also show that our model is able to effectively learn generalized representations when provided a small amount of data containing novel object attributes. Using the CoGenT generalization task, we show more than a 20 percentage point improvement over the current state of the art."}

To encourage development of models geared towards the latter, we propose a new setting for VQA where for every question type, train and test sets have different prior distributions of answers. Specifically, we present new splits of the VQA v1 and VQA v2 datasets, which we call Visual Question Answering under Changing Priors (VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 respectively). First, we evaluate several existing VQA models under this new setting and show that their performance degrades significantly compared to the original VQA setting. Second, we propose a novel Grounded Visual Question Answering model (GVQA) that contains inductive biases and restrictions in the architecture specifically designed to prevent the model from 'cheating' by primarily relying on priors in the training data. Specifically, GVQA explicitly disentangles the recognition of visual concepts present in the image from the identification of plausible answer space for a given question, enabling the model to more robustly generalize across different distributions of answers. GVQA is built off an existing VQA model -- Stacked Attention Networks (SAN). Our experiments demonstrate that GVQA significantly outperforms SAN on both VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets. Interestingly, it also outperforms more powerful VQA models such as Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling (MCB) in several cases. GVQA offers strengths complementary to SAN when trained and evaluated on the original VQA v1 and VQA v2 datasets. Finally, GVQA is more transparent and interpretable than existing VQA models."}

Unlike previous approaches that use known viewpoint labels for training, our method treats the viewpoint labels as latent variables, which are learned in an unsupervised manner during the training using an unaligned object dataset. RotationNet is designed to use only a partial set of multi-view images for inference, and this property makes it useful in practical scenarios where only partial views are available. Moreover, our pose alignment strategy enables one to obtain view-specific feature representations shared across classes, which is important to maintain high accuracy in both object categorization and pose estimation. Effectiveness of RotationNet is demonstrated by its superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods of 3D object classification on 10- and 40-class ModelNet datasets. We also show that RotationNet, even trained without known poses, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on an object pose estimation dataset."}

The first weakness of this approach is the presence of perspective distortion in the 2D depth map. While the depth map is intrinsically 3D data, many previous methods treat depth maps as 2D images that can distort the shape of the actual object through projection from 3D to 2D space. This compels the network to perform perspective distortion-invariant estimation. The second weakness of the conventional approach is that directly regressing 3D coordinates from a 2D image is a highly non-linear mapping, which causes difficulty in the learning procedure. To overcome these weaknesses, we firstly cast the 3D hand and human pose estimation problem from a single depth map into a voxel-to-voxel prediction that uses a 3D voxelized grid and estimates the per-voxel likelihood for each keypoint. We design our model as a 3D CNN that provides accurate estimates while running in real-time. Our system outperforms previous methods in almost all publicly available 3D hand and human pose estimation datasets and placed first in the HANDS 2017 frame-based 3D hand pose estimation challenge.

We argue that deep feature normalization is an important aspect of supervised classification problems where we require the model to represent each class in a multi-class problem equally well. The direct approach to feature normalization through the hard normalization operation results in a non-convex formulation. Instead, Ring loss applies soft normalization, where it gradually learns to constrain the norm to the scaled unit circle while preserving convexity leading to more robust features. We apply Ring loss to large-scale face recognition problems and present results on LFW, the challenging protocols of IJB-A Janus, Janus CS3 (a superset of IJB-A Janus), Celebrity Frontal-Profile (CFP) and MegaFace with 1 million distractors. Ring loss outperforms strong baselines, matches state-of-the-art performance on IJB-A Janus and outperforms all other results on the challenging Janus CS3 thereby achieving state-of-the-art.

Unlabeled tracklets for the person re-ID tasks can be easily obtained by pre-processing, such as pedestrian detection and tracking. In this paper, we propose an approach to exploiting unlabeled tracklets by gradually but steadily improving the discriminative capability of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature representation via stepwise learning. We first initialize a CNN model using one labeled tracklet for each identity. Then we update the CNN model by the following two steps iteratively: 1. sample a few candidates with most reliable pseudo labels from unlabeled tracklets; 2. update the CNN model according to the selected data. Instead of the static sampling strategy applied in existing works, we propose a progressive sampling method to increase the number of the selected pseudo-labeled candidates step by step. We systematically investigate the way how we should select pseudo-labeled tracklets into the training set to make the best use of them. Notably, the rank-1 accuracy of our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 21.46 points (absolute, i.e., 62.67% vs. 41.21%) on the MARS dataset, and 16.53 points on the DukeMTMC-VideoReID dataset."}

A detection based counting method will estimate crowds accurately in low density scenes, while its reliability in congested areas is downgraded. A regression based approach, on the other hand, captures the general density information in crowded regions. Without knowing the location of each person, it tends to overestimate the count in low density areas. Thus, exclusively using either one of them is not sufficient to handle all kinds of scenes with varying densities. To address this issue, a novel end-to-end crowd counting framework, named DecideNet (DEteCtIon and Density Estimation Network) is proposed. It can adaptively decide the appropriate counting mode for different locations on the image based on its real density conditions. DecideNet starts with estimating the crowd density by generating detection and regression based density maps separately. To capture inevitable variation in densities, it incorporates an attention module, meant to adaptively assess the reliability of the two types of estimations. The final crowd counts are obtained with the guidance of the attention module to adopt suitable estimations from the two kinds of density maps. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging crowd counting datasets."}

The central task of face recognition, including face verification and identification, involves face feature discrimination. However, the traditional softmax loss of deep CNNs usually lacks the power of discrimination. To address this problem, recently several loss functions such as center loss, large margin softmax loss, and angular softmax loss have been proposed. All these improved losses share the same idea: maximizing inter-class variance and minimizing intra-class variance. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, namely large margin cosine loss (LMCL), to realize this idea from a different perspective. More specifically, we reformulate the softmax loss as a cosine loss by L2 normalizing both features and weight vectors to remove radial variations, based on which a cosine margin term is introduced to further maximize the decision margin in the angular space. As a result, minimum intra-class variance and maximum inter-class variance are achieved by virtue of normalization and cosine decision margin maximization. We refer to our model trained with LMCL as CosFace. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on the most popular public-domain face recognition datasets such as MegaFace Challenge, Youtube Faces (YTF) and Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW).

Considering the fact that motion information may not be discriminative nor reliable enough for MsP-RID, this paper is focused on handling the large variations in the visual appearances through learning discriminative visual metrics for identification. Existing metric learning-based methods usually exploit pair-wise or triple-wise similarity constraints, that generally demands intensive optimization in metric learning, or leads to degraded performances by using sub-optimal solutions. In addition, as the training data are significantly imbalanced, the learning can be largely dominated by the negative pairs and thus produces unstable and non-discriminative results. In this paper, we propose a novel type of similarity constraint. It assigns the sample points to a set of \textbf{reference points} to produce a linear number of \textbf{reference constraints}. Several optimal transport-based schemes for reference constraint generation are proposed and studied. Based on those constraints, by utilizing a typical regressive metric learning model, the closed-form solution of the learned metric can be easily obtained. Extensive experiments and comparative studies on several public MsP-RID benchmarks have validated the effectiveness of our method and its significant superiority over the state-of-the-art MsP-RID methods in terms of both identification accuracy and running speed."}

A key difficulty is the lack of well annotated large scale datasets. Most existing datasets only provide a limited number of annotations for good views, while ignoring the comparative nature of view selection. In this work, we present the first large scale Comparative Photo Composition dataset, which contains over one million comparative view pairs annotated using a cost-effective crowdsourcing workflow. We show that these comparative view annotations are essential for training a robust neural network model for composition. In addition, we propose a novel knowledge transfer framework to train a fast view proposal network, which runs at 75+ FPS and achieves state-of-the-art performance in image cropping and thumbnail generation tasks on three benchmark datasets. The superiority of our method is also demonstrated in a user study on a challenging experiment, where our method significantly outperforms the baseline methods in producing diversified well-composed views."}

Existing approaches depending on human supervision are generally not scalable as manually identifying correct or incorrect labels is time-consuming, whereas approaches not relying on human supervision are scalable but less effective. To reduce the amount of human supervision for label noise cleaning, we introduce CleanNet, a joint neural embedding network, which only requires a fraction of the classes being manually verified to provide the knowledge of label noise that can be transferred to other classes. We further integrate CleanNet and conventional convolutional neural network classifier into one framework for image classification learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on both of the label noise detection task and the image classification on noisy data task on several large-scale datasets. Experimental results show that CleanNet can reduce label noise detection error rate on held-out classes where no human supervision available by 41.5% compared to current weakly supervised methods. It also achieves 47% of the performance gain of verifying all images with only 3.2% images verified on an image classification task.

However, RNNs are commonly difficult to train due to the well-known gradient vanishing and exploding problems and hard to learn long-term patterns. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) were developed to address these problems, but the use of hyperbolic tangent and the sigmoid action functions results in gradient decay over layers. Consequently, construction of an efficiently trainable deep network is challenging. In addition, all the neurons in an RNN layer are entangled together and their behaviour is hard to interpret. To address these problems, a new type of RNN, referred to as independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN), is proposed in this paper, where neurons in the same layer are independent of each other and they are connected across layers. We have shown that an IndRNN can be easily regulated to prevent the gradient exploding and vanishing problems while allowing the network to learn long-term dependencies. Moreover, an IndRNN can work with non-saturated activation functions such as relu (rectified linear unit) and be still trained robustly. Multiple IndRNNs can be stacked to construct a network that is deeper than the existing RNNs. Experimental results have shown that the proposed IndRNN is able to process very long sequences (over 5000 time steps), can be used to construct very deep networks (21 layers used in the experiment) and still be trained robustly. Better performances have been achieved on various tasks by using IndRNNs compared with the traditional RNN and LSTM."}

We study the impact of autoencoders, side information and losses in improving the alignment and transferability of trained pairwise translation models to unseen translations. We show our approach is scalable and can perform colorization and style transfer between unseen combinations of domains. We evaluate our system in a challenging cross-modal setting where semantic segmentation is estimated from depth images, without explicit access to any depth-semantic segmentation training pairs. Our model outperforms baselines based on pix2pix and CycleGAN models."}

The instructions in our program are based on constructive solid geometry principles, i.e., a set of boolean operations on shape primitives defined recursively. Bottom-up techniques for this shape parsing task rely on primitive detection and are inherently slow since the search space over possible primitive combinations is large. In contrast, our model uses a recurrent neural network that parses the input shape  in a top-down manner, which is significantly faster and yields a compact and easy-to-interpret sequence of modeling instructions. Our model is also more effective as a shape detector compared to existing state-of-the-art detection techniques. We finally demonstrate that our network can be trained on novel datasets without ground-truth program annotations through policy gradient techniques."}

In addition, we study the resolution of this relaxation using popular gradient methods, and further propose a more effective solution using a multilinear decomposition framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

Despite the enduring research of several decades on optical character recognition (OCR), recognizing texts from natural images is still a challenging task. This is because scene texts are often in irregular (e.g. curved, arbitrarily-oriented or seriously distorted) arrangements, which have not yet been well addressed in the literature. Existing methods on text recognition mainly work with regular (horizontal and frontal) texts and cannot be trivially generalized to handle irregular texts. In this paper, we develop the arbitrary orientation network (AON) to directly capture the deep features of irregular texts, which are combined into an attention-based decoder to generate character sequence. The whole network can be trained end-to-end by using only images and word-level annotations. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including the CUTE80, SVT-Perspective, IIIT5k, SVT and ICDAR datasets, show that the proposed AON-based method achieves the-state-of-the-art performance in irregular datasets, and is comparable to major existing methods in regular datasets."}

Segmentation of images, for example, is subject to human labeling bias. Similarly, there are multiple possible pixel values that could plausibly complete occluded image regions. State-of-the art supervised learning methods are typically optimized to make a single test-time prediction for each query, failing to find other modes in the output space. Existing methods that allow for sampling often sacrifice speed or accuracy.  We introduce a simple method for training a neural network, which enables diverse structured predictions to be made for each test-time query. For a single input, we learn to predict a range of possible answers. We compare favorably to methods that seek diversity through an ensemble of networks. Such stochastic multiple choice learning faces mode collapse, where one or more ensemble members fail to receive any training signal. Our best performing solution can be deployed for various tasks, and just involves small modifications to the existing single-mode architecture, loss function, and training regime. We demonstrate that our method results in quantitative improvements across three challenging tasks: 2D image completion, 3D volume estimation, and flow prediction."}

Existing works build upon Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) such that the distribution of the translated images are indistinguishable from the distribution of the target set. However, such set-level constraints cannot learn the instance-level correspondences (e.g. aligned semantic parts in object transfiguration task). This limitation often results in false positives (e.g. geometric or semantic artifacts), and further leads to mode collapse problem. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework for instance-level image translation by Deep Attention GAN (DA-GAN). Such a design enables DA-GAN to decompose the task of translating samples from two sets into translating instances in a highly-structured latent space. Specifically, we jointly learn a deep attention encoder, and the instance-level correspondences could be consequently discovered through attending on the learned instances. Therefore, the constraints could be exploited on both set-level and instance-level. Comparisons against several state-of-the- arts demonstrate the superiority of our approach, and the broad application capability, e.g, pose morphing, data augmentation, etc., pushes the margin of domain translation problem."}

Specifically, RoIRotate is introduced to share convolutional features between detection and recognition. Benefiting from convolution sharing strategy, our FOTS has little computation overhead compared to baseline text detection network, and the joint training method makes our method perform better than these two-stage methods. Experiments on ICDAR 2015, ICDAR 2017 MLT, and ICDAR 2013 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly, which further allows us to develop the first real-time oriented text spotting system which surpasses all previous state-of-the-art results by more than 5% on ICDAR 2015 text spotting task while keeping 22.6 fps."}

It is hence an ambitious goal to develop artificial intelligence agents that can participate fluently in a conversation. While we are still far from achieving this goal, recent progress in visual question answering, image captioning, and visual question generation shows that dialog systems may be realizable in the not too distant future. To this end, a novel dataset was introduced recently and encouraging results were demonstrated, particularly for question answering. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple symmetric discriminative baseline, that can be applied to both predicting an answer as well as predicting a question. We show that this method performs on par with the state of the art, even memory net based methods. In addition, for the first time on the visual dialog dataset, we assess the performance of a system asking questions, and demonstrate how visual dialog can be generated from discriminative question generation and question answering."}

This is typically considered a negative “contrast-loss” phenomenon that hinders clustering and other machine learning techniques. We reinterpret “contrast-loss” as a blessing. Re-deriving “contrast-loss” using the law of large numbers, we show it results in a distribution’s instances concentrating on a thin “hyper-shell”. The hollow center means apparently chaotically overlapping distributions are actually intrinsically separable. We use this to develop distribution-clustering, an elegant algorithm for grouping of data points by their (unknown) underlying distribution. Distribution-clustering, creates notably clean clusters from raw unlabeled data, estimates the number of clusters for itself and is inherently robust to “outliers” which form their own clusters. This enables trawling for patterns in unorganized data and may be the key to enabling machine intelligence."}

Our work analyzes the role of motifs: regularly appearing substructures in scene graphs. We present new quantitative insights on such repeated structures in the Visual Genome dataset. Our analysis shows that object labels are highly predictive of relation labels but not vice-versa. We also find that there are recurring patterns even in larger subgraphs: more than 50% of graphs contain motifs involving at least two relations. Our analysis motivates a new baseline: given object detections, predict the most frequent relation between object pairs with the given labels, as seen in the training set. This baseline improves on the previous state-of-the-art by an average of 3.6% relative improvement across evaluation settings. We then introduce Stacked Motif Networks, a new architecture designed to capture higher order motifs in scene graphs that further improves over our strong baseline by an average 7.1% relative gain.

In this paper, we propose a unified framework to tackle these two problems simultaneously. The uniqueness of our design is a sensor fusion scheme which integrates camera videos, motion sensors (GPS/IMU), and a 3D semantic map in order to achieve robustness and efficiency of the system.Specifically, we first have an initial coarse camera pose obtained from consumer-grade GPS/IMU, based on which a label map can be rendered from the 3D semantic map. Then, the rendered label map and the RGB image are jointly fed into a pose CNN, yielding a corrected camera pose. In addition, to incorporate temporal information, a multi-layer recurrent neural network (RNN) is further deployed improve the pose accuracy. Finally, based on the pose from RNN, we render a new label map, which is fed together with the RGB image into a segment CNN which produces per-pixel semantic label. In order to validate our approach, we build a dataset with registered 3D point clouds and video camera images. Both the point clouds and the images are semantically-labeled. Each video frame has ground truth pose from highly accurate motion sensors. We show that practically, pose estimation solely relying on images like PoseNet~cite{Kendall_2015_ICCV} may fail due to street view confusion, and it is important to fuse multiple sensors. Finally, various ablation studies are performed, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. In particular, we show that scene parsing and pose estimation are mutually beneficial to achieve a more robust and accurate system."}

Most of existing methods require expensive pairs of input-retouched images or produce results in a non-interpretable way. In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based method for color enhancement to explicitly model the step-wise nature of human retouching process. We cast a color enhancement process as a Markov Decision Process where actions are defined as global color adjustment operations. Then we train our agent to learn the optimal global enhancement sequence of the actions. In addition, we present a `distort-and-recover' training scheme which only requires high-quality reference images for training instead of input and retouched image pairs. Given high-quality reference images, we distort the images' color distribution and form distorted-reference image pairs for training. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method produces decent enhancement results and our DRL approach is more suitable for the `distort-and-recover' training scheme than previous supervised approaches.

However, such models are deprived of the rich dynamic structure and motions that also define human activity. We propose an approach that hallucinates the unobserved future motion implied by a single snapshot to help static-image action recognition. The key idea is to learn a prior over short-term dynamics from thousands of unlabeled videos, infer the anticipated optical flow on novel static images, and then train discriminative models that exploit both streams of information. Our main contributions are twofold.  First, we devise an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network and a novel optical flow encoding that can translate a static image into an accurate flow map.  Second, we show the power of hallucinated flow for recognition, successfully transferring the learned motion into a standard two-stream network for activity recognition.  On seven datasets, we demonstrate the power of the approach.  It not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for dense optical flow prediction, but also consistently enhances recognition of actions and dynamic scenes."}

When we consider grounding in instructional videos, this problem becomes profoundly more complex: the latent temporal structure of instructional videos breaks independence assumptions and necessitates contextual understanding for resolving ambiguous visual-linguistic cues. Furthermore, dense annotations and video data scale mean supervised approaches are prohibitively costly. In this work, we propose to tackle this new task with a weakly-supervised framework for reference-aware visual grounding in instructional videos, where only the temporal alignment between the transcription and the video segment are available for supervision. We introduce the visually grounded action graph, a structured representation capturing the latent dependency between grounding and references in video. For optimization, we propose a new reference-aware multiple instance learning (RA-MIL) objective for weak supervision of grounding in videos. We evaluate our approach over unconstrained videos from YouCookII and RoboWatch, augmented with new reference-grounding test set annotations. We demonstrate that our jointly optimized, reference-aware approach simultaneously improves visual grounding, reference-resolution, and generalization to unseen instructional video categories."}

We propose a novel spatio-temporal Markov Random Field (MRF) model defined over pixels to handle this problem. Unlike conventional MRF models, the spatial dependencies among pixels in our model are encoded by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, for a given object, the probability of a labeling to a set of spatially neighboring pixels can be predicted by a CNN trained for this specific object. As a result, higher-order, richer dependencies among pixels in the set can be implicitly modeled by the CNN. With temporal dependencies established by optical flow, the resulting MRF model combines both spatial and temporal cues for tackling video object segmentation. However, performing inference in the MRF model is very difficult due to the very high-order dependencies. To this end, we propose a novel CNN-embedded algorithm to perform approximate inference in the MRF. This algorithm proceeds by alternating between a temporal fusion step and a feed-forward CNN step. When initialized with an appearance-based one-shot segmentation CNN, our model outperforms the winning entries of the DAVIS 2017 Challenge, without resorting to model ensembling or any dedicated detectors."}

While fully supervised systems have gained much attention lately, full annotation of each action within the video is costly and impractical for large amounts of video data. Thus, weakly supervised action detection and temporal segmentation methods are of great importance. While most works in this area assume an ordered sequence of occurring actions to be given, our approach only uses a set of actions. Such action sets provide much less supervision since neither action ordering nor the number of action occurrences are known. In exchange, they can be easily obtained, for instance, from meta-tags, while ordered sequences still require human annotation. We introduce a system that automatically learns to temporally segment and label actions in a video, where the only supervision that is used are action sets. An evaluation on three datasets shows that our method still achieves good results although the amount of supervision is significantly smaller than for other related methods."}

The AVA dataset densely annotates 80 atomic visual actions in 437 15-minute video clips, where actions are localized in space and time, resulting in 1.59M action labels with multiple labels per person occurring frequently. The key characteristics of our dataset are: (1) the definition of atomic visual actions,  rather than composite actions; (2) precise spatio-temporal annotations with possibly multiple annotations for each person; (3) exhaustive annotation of these atomic actions over 15-minute video clips; (4) people temporally linked across consecutive segments; and (5) using movies to gather a varied set of action representations. This departs from existing datasets for spatio-temporal action recognition, which typically provide sparse annotations for composite actions in short video clips.  AVA, with its realistic scene and action complexity, exposes the intrinsic difficulty of action recognition. To benchmark this, we present a novel approach for action localization that builds upon the current state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrates better performance on JHMDB and UCF101-24 categories. While setting a new state of the art on existing datasets, the overall results on AVA are low at 15.8% mAP, underscoring the need for developing new approaches for video understanding."}

At the same time, MX-LSTM predicts the future head poses, increasing the standard capabilities of the long-term trajectory forecasting approaches. With standard head pose estimators and an attentional-based social pooling, Mixing-LSTM scores the new trajectory forecasting state-of-the-art in all the considered datasets (Zara01, Zara02, UCY, and TownCentre) with a dramatic margin when the pedestrians slow down, a case where most of the forecasting approaches struggle to provide an accurate solution."}

Given context in the form of an image and an associated caption summarising the contents of the image, FlipDial learns both to answer questions and put forward questions, capable of generating entire sequences of dialogue (question-answer pairs) which are diverse and relevant to the image. To do this, FlipDial relies on a simple but surprisingly powerful idea: it uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to encode entire dialogues directly, implicitly capturing dialogue context, and conditional VAEs to learn the generative model. FlipDial outperforms the state-of-the-art model in the sequential answering task (1VD) on the VisDial dataset by 5 points in Mean Rank using the generated answers.

An object detector, trained with low IoU threshold, e.g. 0.5, usually produces noisy detections. However, detection performance tends to degrade with increasing the IoU thresholds. Two main factors are responsible for this: 1) overfitting during training, due to exponentially vanishing positive samples, and 2) inference-time mismatch between the IoUs for which the detector is optimal and those of the input hypotheses. A multi-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, is proposed to address these problems. It consists of a sequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, to be sequentially more selective against close false positives. The detectors are trained stage by stage, leveraging the observation that the output of a detector is a good distribution for training the next higher quality detector. The resampling of progressively improved hypotheses guarantees that all detectors have a positive set of examples of equivalent size, reducing the overfitting problem. The same cascade procedure is applied at inference, enabling a closer match between the hypotheses and the detector quality of each stage. A simple implementation of the Cascade R-CNN is shown to surpass all single-model object detectors on the challenging COCO dataset. Experiments also show that the Cascade R-CNN is widely applicable across detector architectures, achieving consistent gains independently of the baseline detector strength. The code is available at https://github.com/zhaoweicai/cascade-rcnn."}

How- ever, mini-batch size, a key factor for the training of deep neural networks, has not been well studied for object detec- tion. In this paper, we propose a Large Mini-Batch Object Detector (MegDet) to enable the training with a large mini- batch size up to 256, so that we can effectively utilize at most 128 GPUs to significantly shorten the training time. Technically, we suggest a warmup learning rate policy and Cross-GPU Batch Normalization, which together allow us to successfully train a large mini-batch detector in much less time (e.g., from 33 hours to 4 hours), and achieve even better accuracy. The MegDet is the backbone of our sub- mission (mmAP 52.5%) to COCO 2017 Challenge, where we won the 1st place of Detection task."}

SfSNet is designed to reflect a physical lambertian rendering model. SfSNet learns from a mixture of labeled synthetic and unlabeled real world images. This allows the network to capture low frequency variations from synthetic and high frequency details from real images through the photometric reconstruction loss. SfSNet consists of a new decomposition architecture with residual blocks that learns a complete separation of albedo and normal. This is used along with the original image to predict lighting. SfSNet produces significantly better quantitative and qualitative results than state-of-the-art methods for inverse rendering and independent normal and illumination estimation."}

Given a set of photographs with the desired characteristics, the proposed method learns a photo enhancer which transforms an input image into an enhanced image with those characteristics. The method is based on the framework of two-way generative adversarial networks (GANs) with several improvements. First, we augment the U-Net with global features and show that it is more effective. The global U-Net acts as the generator in our GAN model. Second, we improve Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) with an adaptive weighting scheme. With this scheme, training converges faster and better, and is less sensitive to parameters than WGAN-GP. Finally, we propose to use individual batch normalization layers for generators in two-way GANs. It helps generators better adapt to their own input distributions. All together, they significantly improve the stability of GAN training for our application. Both quantitative and visual results show that the proposed method is effective for enhancing images."}

In addition to Lambertian surface properties, our approach fully automatically computes the specular albedo, material shininess, and a foreground segmentation. We tackle this challenging and ill-posed inverse rendering problem using recent advances in image-to-image translation techniques based on deep convolutional encoder–decoder architectures. The underlying core representations of our approach are specular shading, diffuse shading and mirror images, which allow to learn the effective and accurate separation of diffuse and specular albedo. In addition, we propose a novel highly efficient perceptual rendering loss that mimics real world image formation and obtains intermediate results even during run time. The estimation of material parameters at real-time frame rates enables exciting mixed reality applications, such as seamless illumination-consistent integration of virtual objects into realworld scenes, and virtual material cloning.We demonstrate our approach in a live setup, compare it to the state of the art, and demonstrate its effectiveness through quantitative and qualitative evaluation."}

The classical techniques require measuring projections, called sinograms, from a full 180 degree view of the object. However, obtaining a full-view is not always feasible, such as when scanning irregular objects that limit flexibility of scanner rotation. The resulting limited angle sinograms are known to produce highly artifact-laden reconstructions with existing techniques. In this paper, we propose to address this problem using CTNet -- a system of 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks, that operates directly on a limited angle sinogram to predict the reconstruction. We use the x-ray transform on this prediction to obtain a ``completed'' sinogram, as if it came from a full 180 degree view. We feed this to standard analytical and iterative reconstruction techniques to obtain the final reconstruction. We show with extensive experimentation on a challenging real world dataset that this combined strategy outperforms many competitive baselines. We also propose a measure of confidence for the reconstruction that enables a practitioner to gauge the reliability of a prediction made by  CTNet. We show that this measure is a strong indicator of quality as measured by the PSNR, while not requiring ground truth at test time. Finally, using a segmentation experiment, we show that our reconstruction also preserves the 3D structure of objects better than existing solutions."}

Most existing approaches explore the motion cue using optical flows. However, optical flow usually contains motion on both the interested human bodies and the undesired background. This \"noisy\" motion representation makes it very challenging for pose estimation and action recognition in real scenarios. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel deep motion representation, called PoseFlow, which reveals human motion in videos while suppressing background and motion blur, and being robust to occlusion. For learning PoseFlow with mild computational cost, we propose a functionally structured spatial-temporal deep network, PoseFlow Net (PFN), to jointly solve the skeleton localization and matching problems of PoseFlow. Comprehensive experiments show that PFN outperforms the state-of-the-art deep flow estimation models in generating PoseFlow. Moreover, PoseFlow demonstrates its potential on  improving two challenging tasks in human video analysis: pose estimation and action recognition."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2018", "Area": "CV", "Where": "CVPR", "Abbreviation": "FFNet", "Title": "Video Fast-Forwarding via Reinforcement Learning", "Abstract": "For many intelligent applications with limited computation, communication, storage and energy resources, there is an imperative need of vision methods that could select an informative subset of the input video for efficient processing at or near real time. In the literature, there are two relevant groups of approaches: generating a \"trailer\" for a video or fast-forwarding while watching/processing the video. The first group is supported by video summarization techniques, which require processing of the entire video to select an important subset for showing to users. In the second group, current fast-forwarding methods depend on either manual control or automatic adaptation of playback speed, which often do not present an accurate representation and may still require processing of every frame. In this paper, we introduce FastForwardNet (FFNet), a reinforcement learning agent that gets inspiration from video summarization and does fast-forwarding differently. It is an online framework that automatically fast-forwards a video and presents a representative subset of frames to users on the fly. It does not require processing the entire video but just the portion that is selected by the fast-forward agent, which makes the process very computationally efficient. The online nature of our proposed method also enables the users to begin fast-forwarding at any point of the video. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can provide better representation of the input video (about 6%-20% improvement on coverage of important frames) with much less processing requirement (more than 80% reduction in the number of frames processed)."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2018", "Area": "CV", "Where": "CVPR", "Abbreviation": "Attend and Interact", "Title": "Higher-Order Object Interactions for Video Understanding", "Abstract": "Human actions often involve complex interactions across several inter-related objects in the scene. However, existing approaches to fine-grained video understanding or visual relationship detection often rely on single object representation or pairwise object relationships. Furthermore, learning interactions across multiple objects in hundreds of frames for video is computationally infeasible and performance may suffer since a large combinatorial space has to be modeled. In this paper, we propose to efficiently learn higher-order interactions between arbitrary subgroups of objects for fine-grained video understanding. We demonstrate that modeling object interactions significantly improves accuracy for both action recognition and video captioning, while saving more than 3-times the computation over traditional pairwise relationships. The proposed method is validated on two large-scale datasets: Kinetics and ActivityNet Captions. Our SINet and SINet-Caption achieve state-of-the-art performances on both datasets even though the videos are sampled at a maximum of 1 FPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work modeling object interactions on open domain large-scale video datasets, and we additionally model higher-order object interactions which improves the performance with low computational costs."}

The new architecture utilizes two new operations, pointwise group convolution and channel shuffle, to greatly reduce computation cost while maintaining accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet classification and MS COCO object detection demonstrate the superior performance of ShuffleNet over other structures, e.g. lower top-1 error (absolute 7.8%) than recent MobileNet~cite{howard2017mobilenets} on ImageNet classification task, under the computation budget of 40 MFLOPs. On an ARM-based mobile device, ShuffleNet achieves $sim$13$\times$ actual speedup over AlexNet while maintaining comparable accuracy."}

Based upon previous work on part localization, in this paper, we address the problem of inferring rich semantics imparted by an object part in still images. Specifically, we propose to tokenize the semantic space as a discrete set of part states. Our modeling of part state is spatially localized, therefore, we formulate the part state inference problem as a pixel-wise annotation problem. An iterative part-state inference neural network that is efficient in time and accurate in performance is specifically designed for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively predict the semantic states of parts and simultaneously improve part segmentation, thus benefiting a number of visual understanding applications. The other contribution of this paper is our part state dataset which contains rich part-level semantic annotations."}

In this work we propose an object detection algorithm that not only considers object visual appearance, but also makes use of two kinds of context including scene contextual information and object relationships within a single image. Therefore, object detection is regarded as both a cognition problem and a reasoning problem when leveraging these structured information. Specifically, this paper formulates object detection as a problem of graph structure inference, where given an image the objects are treated as nodes in a graph and relationships between the objects are modeled as edges in such graph. To this end, we present a so-called Structure Inference Network (SIN), a detector that incorporates into a typical detection framework (e.g. Faster R-CNN) with a graphical model which aims to infer object state. Comprehensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets indicate that scene context and object relationships truly improve the performance of object detection with more desirable and reasonable outputs."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2018", "Area": "CV", "Where": "CVPR", "Abbreviation": "PoTion", "Title": "Pose MoTion Representation for Action Recognition", "Abstract": "Most state-of-the-art methods for action recognition rely on a two-stream architecture that processes appearance and motion independently. In this paper, we claim that considering them jointly offers rich information for action recognition. We introduce a novel representation that gracefully encodes the movement of some semantic keypoints. We use the human joints as these keypoints and term our Pose moTion representation PoTion. Specifically, we first run a state-of-the-art human pose estimator and extract heatmaps for the human joints in each frame. We obtain our PoTion representation by temporally aggregating these probability maps. This is achieved by colorizing each of them depending on the relative time of the frames in the video clip and summing them. This fixed-size representation for an entire video clip is suitable to classify actions using a shallow convolutional neural network. Our experimental evaluation shows that PoTion outperforms other state-of-the-art pose representations. Furthermore, it is complementary to standard appearance and motion streams. When combining PoTion with the recent two-stream I3D approach [5], we obtain state-of-the-art performance on the JHMDB, HMDB and UCF101 datasets."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2018", "Area": "CV", "Where": "CVPR", "Abbreviation": "Pulling Actions out of Context", "Title": "Explicit Separation for Effective Combination", "Abstract": "The ability to recognize human actions in video has many potential applications. Human action recognition, however, is tremendously challenging for computers due to the complexity of video data and the subtlety of human actions. Most current recognition systems flounder on the inability to separate human actions from co-occurring factors that usually dominate subtle human actions.   In this paper, we propose a novel approach for training a human action recognizer, one that can: (1) explicitly factorize human actions from the co-occurring factors; (2) deliberately build a model for human actions and a separate model for all correlated contextual elements; and (3) effectively combine the models for human action recognition. Our approach exploits the benefits of conjugate samples of human actions, which are video clips that are contextually similar to human action samples, but do not contain the action. Experiments on ActionThread, PASCAL VOC, UCF101, and Hollywood2 datasets demonstrate the ability to separate action from context of the proposed approach."}

However, few studies have offered a solution of how to identify an arbitrary patch of a person image. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate matching method to address this problem. The proposed method leverages Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to generate correspondingly-size spatial feature maps such that pixel-level features are consistent. To match a pair of person images of different sizes, a novel method called Deep Spatial feature Reconstruction (DSR) is further developed to avoid explicit alignment. Specifically, we exploit the reconstructing error from dictionary learning to calculate the similarity between different spatial feature maps. In that way, we expect that the proposed FCN can decrease the similarity of coupled images from different persons and vice versa. Experimental results on two partial person datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with several state-of-the-art partial person re-id approaches."}

Given one input image of a neutral face, can we generate multiple smile videos with distinctive characteristics? To tackle this one-to-many video generation problem, we propose a novel deep learning architecture named Conditional Multi-Mode Network (CMM-Net). To better encode the dynamics of facial expressions, CMM-Net explicitly exploits facial landmarks for generating smile sequences. Specifically, a variational auto-encoder is used to learn a facial landmark embedding. This single embedding is then exploited by a conditional recurrent network which generates a landmark embedding sequence conditioned on a specific expression (e.g., spontaneous smile). Next, the generated landmark embeddings are fed into a multi-mode recurrent landmark generator, producing a set of landmark sequences still associated to the given smile class but clearly distinct from each other. Finally, these landmark sequences are translated into face videos. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CMM-Net in generating realistic videos of multiple smile expressions."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2018", "Area": "CV", "Where": "CVPR", "Abbreviation": "UV-GAN", "Title": "Adversarial Facial UV Map Completion for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition", "Abstract": "Recently proposed robust 3D face alignment methods establish either dense or sparse correspondence between a 3D face model and a 2D facial image. The use of these methods presents new challenges as well as opportunities for facial texture analysis. In particular, by sampling the image using the fitted model, a facial UV can be created. Unfortunately, due to self-occlusion, such a UV map is always incomplete. In this paper, we propose a framework for training Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to complete the facial UV map extracted from in-the-wild images. To this end, we first gather complete UV maps by fitting a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) to various multiview image and video datasets, as well as leveraging on a new 3D dataset with over 3,000 identities. Second, we devise a meticulously designed architecture that combines local and global adversarial DCNNs to learn an identity-preserving facial UV completion model. We demonstrate that by attaching the completed UV to the fitted mesh and generating instances of arbitrary poses, we can increase pose variations for training deep face recognition/verification models, and minimise pose discrepancy during testing, which lead to better performance. Experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild UV datasets prove the effectiveness of our adversarial UV completion model. We achieve state-of-the-art verification accuracy, 94.05%, under the CFP frontal-profile protocol only by combining pose augmentation during training and pose discrepancy reduction during testing. We will release the first in-the-wild UV dataset (we refer as WildUV) that comprises of complete facial UV maps from 1,892 identities for research purposes."}
