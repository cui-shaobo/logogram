Increasingly, DL models are applied in healthcare settings with seemingly high levels of performance on-par with medical experts. Yet, very few are deployed into real-life scenarios with variable success rate. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of trust in those models by medical professionals driven by the black-box nature of the deployed models. Numerous explainable techniques have been developed to alleviate this issue by providing a view on how the model reached a given decision. Recent studies have shown that those explanations can expose the models' reliance on areas of the feature space that has no justifiable medical interpretation, widening the gap with the medical experts. In this paper we evaluate the deviation of saliency maps produced by DL classification models from radiologist's eye-gaze while they study the MIMIC-CXR-EGD images, and we propose a novel model architecture that utilises model explanations during training only (i.e. not during inference) to improve the overall plausibility of the model explanations. We substantially improve the similarity between the model's explanations and radiologists' eye-gaze data, reducing Kullback-Leibler Divergence by 90% and increasing Normalised Scanpath Saliency by 216%. We argue that this significant improvement is an important step towards building more robust and interpretable DL solutions in healthcare."}

Recent W-VLP methods, which pair visual features with object tags, help achieve performances comparable with some VLP models trained with aligned pairs in various V-L downstream tasks. This, however, is not the case in cross- modal retrieval (XMR). We argue that the learning of such a W-VLP model is curbed and biased by the object tags of limited semantics. We address the lack of paired V-L data for model supervision with a novel Visual Vocabulary based Feature Hallucinator (WFH), which is trained via weak supervision as a W-VLP model, not requiring images paired with captions. WFH generates visual hallucinations from texts, which are then paired with the originally unpaired texts, allowing more diverse interactions across modalities. Empirically, WFH consistently boosts the prior W-VLP works, e.g. U-VisualBERT (U-VB), over a variety of V-L tasks, i.e. XMR, Visual Question Answering, etc. Notably, benchmarked with recall@ 1,5,10 , it consistently improves U-VB on image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval on two popular datasets Flickr30K and MSCOCO. Meanwhile, it gains by at least 14.5% in cross-dataset generalization tests on these XMR tasks. Moreover, in other V-L downstream tasks considered, our WFH models are on par with models trained with paired V-L data, revealing the utility of unpaired data. These results demonstrate greater generalization of the proposed W-VLP model with WFH."}

In this work, we describe the Conditional Attribute Subsampling Toolkit (CAST) for selecting data subsets for fine-grained scientific evaluations. Our toolkit efficiently filters data given an arbitrary number of conditions for metadata attributes. The purpose of the toolkit is to allow researchers to easily to evaluate models on targeted test distributions. The functionality of CAST is demonstrated on the WebFace42M face Recognition dataset. We calculate over 50 attributes for this dataset including race, image quality, facial features, and accessories. Using our toolkit, we create over a hundred test sets conditioned on one or multiple attributes. Results are presented for subsets of various demographics and image quality ranges. Using eleven different subsets, we build a face recognition 1:1 verification benchmark called C11 that exclusively contains pairs that are near the decision threshold. Evaluation on C11 with state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the suitability of the proposed benchmark. The toolkit is publicly available at https://github.com/WesRobbins/CAST."}

One of the most popular SSL approaches is pseudo-labeling (PL). PL approaches assign labels to unlabeled data before re-training the model with a combination of labeled and pseudo-labeled data. However, PL methods are severely degraded by noise and are prone to over-fitting to noisy labels, due to the inclusion of erroneous high confidence pseudo-labels generated from poorly calibrated models, thus, rendering threshold-based selection ineffective. Moreover, the combinatorial complexity of the hypothesis space and the error accumulation due to multiple incorrect autoregressive steps posit pseudo-labeling challenging for sequential self-training. To this end, we propose a pseudo-label generation and an uncertainty-based data selection framework for semi-supervised text recognition. We first use Beam-Search inference to yield highly probable hypotheses to assign pseudo-labels to the unlabelled examples. Then we adopt an ensemble of models, sampled by applying dropout, to obtain a robust estimate of the uncertainty associated with the prediction, considering both the character-level and word-level predictive distribution to select good quality pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on several benchmark handwriting and scene-text datasets show that our method outperforms the baseline approaches and the previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised text-recognition methods."}

Even though existing approaches can successfully transfer style information, arbitrary style transfer still faces many challenges, such as the content leak issue. To be specific, the embedding of artistic style can lead to content changes. In this paper, we solve the content leak problem from the perspective of image restoration. In particular, an iterative architecture is proposed to achieve the restorable arbitrary style transfer (RAST), which can realize the transmission of both content and style information through the multi-restorations. We control the content-style balance in stylized images by the accuracy of image restoration. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed RAST architecture, we design two novel loss functions: multi-restoration loss and style difference loss. In addition, we propose a new quantitative evaluation method to measure content preservation performance and style embedding performance. Comprehensive experiments comparing with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our proposed architecture can produce stylized images with superior performance on content preservation and style embedding."}

Recent works show promising results on single datasets. Nevertheless, the generalization ability of these methods under different attribute distributions, viewpoints, varying illumination, and low resolutions remains rarely understood due to strong biases and varying attributes in current datasets. To close this gap and support a systematic investigation, we present UPAR, the Unified Person Attribute Recognition Dataset. It is based on four well-known person attribute recognition datasets: PA100K, PETA, RAPv2, and Market1501. We unify those datasets by providing 3,3M additional annotations to harmonize 40 important binary attributes over 12 attribute categories across the datasets. We thus enable research on generalizable pedestrian attribute recognition as well as attribute-based person retrieval for the first time. Due to the vast variance of the image distribution, pedestrian pose, scale, and occlusion, existing approaches are greatly challenged both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we develop a strong baseline for PAR and attribute-based person retrieval based on a thorough analysis of regularization methods. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain and specialization settings on PA100k, PETA, RAPv2, Market1501-Attributes, and UPAR. We believe UPAR and our strong baseline will contribute to the artificial intelligence community and promote research on large-scale, generalizable attribute recognition systems."}

In recent years, several adaptive momentum based SGD optimizers have been introduced, such as Adam, diffGrad, Radam and AdaBelief. However, the existing SGD optimizers do not exploit the gradient norm of past iterations and lead to poor convergence and performance. In this paper, we propose a novel AdaNorm based SGD optimizers by correcting the norm of gradient in each iteration based on the adaptive training history of gradient norm. By doing so, the proposed optimizers are able to maintain high and representive gradient throughout the training and solves the low and atypical gradient problems. The proposed concept is generic and can be used with any existing SGD optimizer. We show the efficacy of the proposed AdaNorm with four state-of-the-art optimizers, including Adam, diffGrad, Radam and AdaBelief. We depict the performance improvement due to the proposed optimizers using three CNN models, including VGG16, ResNet18 and ResNet50, on three benchmark object recognition datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet."}

Domain-specific challenges associated with visual scenes in movies include transitions, person coverage, and a wide array of real-life and fictional scenarios. Existing visual scene datasets in movies have limited taxonomies and don't consider the visual scene transition within movie clips. In this work, we address the problem of visual scene recognition in movies by first automatically curating a new and extensive movie-centric taxonomy of 179 scene labels derived from movie scripts and auxiliary web-based video datasets. Instead of manual annotations which can be expensive, we use CLIP to weakly label 1.12 million shots from 32K movie clips based on our proposed taxonomy. We provide baseline visual models trained on the weakly labeled dataset called MovieCLIP and evaluate them on an independent dataset verified by human raters. We show that leveraging features from models pretrained on MovieCLIP benefits downstream tasks such as multi-label scene and genre classification of web videos and movie trailers."}

Specifically, TI2Net recognizes fake videos by capturing the dissimilarities of human faces among video frames of the same identity. Therefore, TI2Net is a reference-agnostic detector and can be used on unseen datasets. For a video clip of a given identity, identity information in all frames will first be encoded to identity vectors. TI2Net learns the temporal identity embedding from the temporal difference of the identity vectors. The temporal embedding, representing the identity inconsistency in the video clip, is finally used to determine the authenticity of the video clip. During training, TI2Net incorporates triplet loss to learn more discriminative temporal embeddings. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed TI2Net. Experimental results indicate that TI2Net generalizes well to unseen manipulations and datasets with unseen identities. Besides, TI2Net also shows robust performance against compression and additive noise."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2023", "Area": "CV", "Where": "WACV", "Abbreviation": "ScoreNet", "Title": "Learning Non-Uniform Attention and Augmentation for Transformer-Based Histopathological Image Classification", "Abstract": "Progress in digital pathology is hindered by high-resolution images and the prohibitive cost of exhaustive localized annotations. The commonly used paradigm to categorize pathology images is patch-based processing, which often incorporates multiple instance learning MIL to aggregate local patch-level representations yielding image-level prediction. Nonetheless, diagnostically relevant regions may only take a small fraction of the whole tissue, and current MIL-based approaches often process images uniformly, discarding the inter-patches interactions. To alleviate these issues, we propose ScoreNet, a new efficient transformer that exploits a differentiable recommendation stage to extract discriminative image regions and dedicate computational resources accordingly. The proposed transformer leverages the local and global attention of a few dynamically recommended high-resolution regions at an efficient computational cost. We further introduce a novel mixing data-augmentation, namely ScoreMix, by leveraging the image's semantic distribution to guide the data mixing and produce coherent sample-label pairs. ScoreMix is embarrassingly simple and mitigates the pitfalls of previous augmentations, which assume a uniform semantic distribution and risk mislabeling the samples. Thorough experiments and ablation studies on three breast cancer histology datasets of Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) have validated the superiority of our approach over prior arts, including transformer-based models on tumour regions-of-interest TRoIs classification. ScoreNet equipped with proposed ScoreMix augmentation demonstrates better generalization capabilities and achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with only 50% of the data compared to other mixing augmentation variants. Finally, ScoreNet yields high efficacy and outperforms SOTA efficient transformers, namely TransPath and SwinTransformer, with throughput around 3x and 4x higher than the aforementioned architectures, respectively."}

Keypoint detection differs from other visual tasks where contrastive learning has been applied because the input is a set of images in which multiple keypoints are annotated. This requires the contrastive learning to be extended such that the keypoints are represented and detected independently, which enables the contrastive loss to make the keypoint features different from each other and from the background. Our approach has two benefits: It enables us to exploit the power of contrastive learning for keypoint detection, and by detecting each keypoint independently the detection becomes more robust to occlusion compared to holistic methods, such as stacked hourglass networks, which attempt to detect all keypoints jointly. Our CoKe framework introduces several technical innovations. In particular, we introduce: (i) A clutter bank to represent non-keypoint features; (ii) a keypoint bank that stores prototypical representations of keypoints to approximate the contrastive loss between keypoints; and (iii) a cumulative moving average update to learn the keypoint prototypes while training the feature extractor. Our experiments on a range of diverse datasets (PASCAL3D+, MPII, ObjectNet3D) show that our approach works as well, or better than, alternative methods for keypoint detection, even for human keypoints, for which the literature is vast. Moreover, we observe that CoKe is exceptionally robust to partial occlusion and previously unseen object poses."}

As a result, published works usually target a particular benchmark, and are not easily comparable to each another. We believe that the development of generalized methods that can tackle multiple tasks requires greater cohesion among these research sub-communities. In this paper, we aim to facilitate this by proposing BURST, a dataset which contains thousands of diverse videos with high-quality object masks, and an associated benchmark with six tasks involving object tracking and segmentation in video. All tasks are evaluated using the same data and comparable metrics, which enables researchers to consider them in unison, and hence, more effectively pool knowledge from different methods across different tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate several baselines for all tasks and show that approaches for one task can be applied to another with a quantifiable and explainable performance difference.

However, there present many challenges for the existing ultra-FGVC methods, firstly there are always not enough samples in the existing ultra-FGVC datasets based on which the models can easily get overfitting. Secondly, in practice, we are likely to find new species that we have not seen before and need to add them to existing models, which is known as incremental learning. The existing methods solve these problems by Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL), but the main challenge of the FSCIL models on ultra-FGVC tasks lies in their inferior discrimination detection ability since they usually use low-capacity networks to extract features, which leads to insufficient discriminative details extraction from ultra-fine-grained images. In this paper, a self-supervised feature enhancement for the few-shot incremental learning network (SSFE-Net) is proposed to solve this problem. Specifically, a self-supervised learning (SSL) and knowledge distillation (KD) framework is developed to enhance the feature extraction of the low-capacity backbone network for ultra-FGVC few-shot class incremental learning tasks. Besides, we for the first time create a series of benchmarks for FSCIL tasks on two public ultra-FGVC datasets and three normal fine-grained datasets, which will facilitate the development of the Ultra-FGVC community. Extensive experimental results on public ultra-FGVC datasets and other state-of-the-art benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

To our knowledge, MEVID represents the most-varied video person ReID dataset, spanning an extensive indoor and outdoor environment across nine unique dates in a 73-day window, various camera viewpoints, and entity clothing changes. Specifically, we label the identities of 158 unique people wearing 598 outfits taken from 8,092 tracklets, average length of about 590 frames, seen in 33 camera views from the very-large-scale MEVA person activities dataset. While other datasets have more unique identities, MEVID emphasizes a richer set of information about each individual, such as: 4 outfits/identity vs. 2 outfits/identity in CCVID, 33 viewpoints across 17 locations vs. 6 in 5 simulated locations for MTA, and 10 million frames vs. 3 million for LS-VID. Being based on the MEVA video dataset, we also inherit data that is intentionally demographically balanced to the continental United States. To accelerate the annotation process, we developed a semi-automatic annotation framework and GUI that combines state-of-the-art real-time models for object detection, pose estimation, person ReID, and multi-object tracking. We evaluate several state-of-the-art methods on MEVID challenge problems and comprehensively quantify their robustness in terms of changes of outfit, scale, and background location. Our quantitative analysis on the realistic, unique aspects of MEVID shows that there are significant remaining challenges in video person ReID and indicates important directions for future research."}

Such models are trained on large-scale datasets that contain millions of real human face images collected from the internet. Web-crawled face images are severely biased (in terms of race, lighting, make-up, etc) and often contain label noise. More importantly, the face images are collected without explicit consent, raising ethical concerns. To avoid such problems, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset for face recognition, obtained by rendering digital faces using a computer graphics pipeline. We first demonstrate that aggressive data augmentation can significantly reduce the synthetic-to-real domain gap. Having full control over the rendering pipeline, we also study how each attribute (e.g., variation in facial pose, accessories and textures) affects the accuracy. Compared to SynFace, a recent method trained on GAN-generated synthetic faces, we reduce the error rate on LFW by 52.5% (accuracy from 91.93% to 96.17%). By fine-tuning the network on a smaller number of real face images that could reasonably be obtained with consent, we achieve accuracy that is comparable to the methods trained on millions of real face images."}

However, the massive computation brought from the full attention mechanism became a heavy burden for memory consumption. Sequentially, the limitation of memory consumption hinders the deployment of the Transformer model on the embedded system where the computing resources are limited. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel memory economy attention mechanism named Couplformer, which decouples the attention map into two sub-matrices and generates the alignment scores from spatial information. Our method enables the Transformer model to improve time and memory efficiency while maintaining expressive power. A series of different scale image classification tasks are applied to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. The result of experiments shows that on the ImageNet-1K classification task, the Couplformer can significantly decrease 42% memory consumption compared with the regular Transformer. Meanwhile, it accesses sufficient accuracy requirements, which outperforms 0.56% on Top-1 accuracy and occupies the same memory footprint. Besides, the Couplformer achieves state-of-art performance in MS COCO 2017 object detection and instance segmentation tasks. As a result, the Couplformer can serve as an efficient backbone in visual tasks and provide a novel perspective on deploying attention mechanisms for researchers."}

Parsing such visually-rich documents is a core task for workflow automation, but it remains challenging since most documents do not encode explicit layout information, e.g., how characters and words are grouped into boxes and ordered into larger semantic entities. Current state-of-the-art layout extraction methods are challenged on such documents as they rely on word sequences to have correct reading order and do not exploit their hierarchical structure. We propose LayerDoc, an approach that uses visual features, textual semantics, and spatial coordinates along with constraint inference to extract the hierarchical layout structure of documents in a bottom-up layer-wise fashion. LayerDoc recursively groups smaller regions into larger semantic elements in 2D to infer complex nested hierarchies. Experiments show that our approach outperforms competitive baselines by 10-15% on three diverse datasets of forms and mobile app screen layouts for the tasks of spatial region classification, higher-order group identification, layout hierarchy extraction, reading order detection, and word grouping."}

Such approaches need labeled data to guide the self distillation process. Inspired by self-supervised (SS) learning, we propose a self-supervised self distillation (SSSD) approach in this work. Based on an unlabeled image dataset, a model is constructed to learn visual representations in a self-supervised manner. This pre-trained model is then adopted to extract visual representations of the target dataset and generates pseudo labels via clustering. The pseudo labels guide the SD process, and thus enable SD to proceed in an unsupervised way (no data labels are required at all). We verify this idea based on evaluations on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this unsupervised SD approach. Performance outperforming similar frameworks is also shown."}

Most current endeavors focus on completely cutting the researcher out of the picture by generating highly generalized models. However, these models invariably fail when faced with novel data, distributed differently than the ones used for training. Rather than approaching the problem with methods that presume the availability of large amounts of target data and computing power for retraining, in this work we address the even greater challenge of designing an approach that requires minimal amounts of new annotated data as well as training time. We do so by designing specialized contrastive losses that leverage the few annotated samples very efficiently. A large set of results show that 3 to 5 annotations lead to models with accuracy that: 1) significantly mitigate the covariate shift effects; 2) matches or surpasses other adaptation methods; 3) even approaches methods that have been fully retrained on the target distribution. The adaptation training is only a few minutes, paving a path towards a balance between model performance, computing requirements and expert-level annotation needs."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose the Panoptic Refinement Network (PRN), which takes masks from base panoptic segmentation models and refines them jointly to produce coherent results. PRN extends the offset map-based architecture of Panoptic-Deeplab with several novel ideas including a foreground mask and instance bounding box offsets, as well as coordinate convolutions for improved spatial prediction.

Triplet loss, popular for metric learning, has made a great success in many computer vision tasks. In this paper, we redesign the patch-based triplet loss in MDE to alleviate the ubiquitous edge-fattening issue. We show two drawbacks of the raw triplet loss in MDE and demonstrate our problem-driven redesigns. First, we present a min. operator based strategy applied to all negative samples, to prevent well-performing negatives sheltering the error of edge-fattening negatives. Second, we split the anchor-positive distance and anchor-negative distance from within the original triplet, which directly optimizes the positives without any mutual effect with the negatives. Extensive experiments show the combination of these two small redesigns can achieve unprecedented results: Our powerful and versatile triplet loss not only makes our model outperform all previous SoTA by a large margin, but also provides substantial performance boosts to a large number of existing models, while introducing no extra inference computation at all."}

Our key idea is to formulate MVS as an end-to-end learnable network, which we refer to as nLMVS-Net, that seamlessly integrates radiometric cues to leverage surface normals as view-independent surface features for learned cost volume construction and filtering. It first estimates surface normals as pixel-wise probability densities for each view with a novel shape-from-shading network. These per-pixel surface normal densities and the input multi-view images are then input to a novel cost volume filtering network that learns to recover per-pixel depth and surface normal. The reflectance is also explicitly estimated by alternating with geometry reconstruction. Extensive quantitative evaluations on newly established synthetic and real-world datasets show that nLMVS-Net can robustly and accurately recover the shape and reflectance of complex objects in natural settings."}

While event cameras can measure subtle brightness changes in high frame rates, the measurements in low lighting or extreme motion suffer from significant domain discrepancy with complex noise. As a result, the performance of event-based vision tasks does not transfer to challenging environments, where the event cameras are expected to thrive over normal cameras. We find that the multi-view consistency of NeRF provides a powerful self-supervision signal for eliminating spurious measurements and extracting the consistent underlying structure despite highly noisy input. Instead of posed images of the original NeRF, the input to Ev-NeRF is the event measurements accompanied by the movements of the sensors. Using the loss function that reflects the measurement model of the sensor, Ev-NeRF creates an integrated neural volume that summarizes the unstructured and sparse data points captured for about 2-4 seconds. The generated neural volume can also produce intensity images from novel views with reasonable depth estimates, which can serve as a high-quality input to various vision-based tasks. Our results show that Ev-NeRF achieves competitive performance for intensity image reconstruction under extreme noise conditions and high-dynamic-range imaging."}

We argue that depending on the application, users of image retrieval systems have different and changing similarity notions that should be incorporated as easily as possible. Therefore, we present Language-Guided Zero-Shot Deep Metric Learning (LanZ-DML) as a new DML setting in which users control the aspects that should be important for image representations without training data by only using natural language. To this end, we propose InDiReCT (Image representations using Dimensionality Reduction on CLIP embedded Texts), a model for LanZ-DML on images that exclusively uses a few text prompts for training. InDiReCT utilizes CLIP as a fixed feature extractor for images and texts and transfers the variation in text prompt embeddings to the image embedding space. Extensive experiments on five datasets and overall thirteen similarity notions show that, despite not seeing any images during training, InDiReCT performs better than strong baselines and approaches the performance of fully-supervised models. An analysis reveals that InDiReCT learns to focus on regions of the image that correlate with the desired similarity notion, which makes it a fast to train and easy to use method to create custom embedding spaces only using natural language."}

However, real-world computing systems do not always provide stable resource guarantees. Computational resources need to be conserved when load from other processes is high, or available memory is low. In this work, we present a training procedure to produce DNNs that can be compressed in real-time to arbitrary compression levels entirely on-device. This enables the deployment of a single model that can efficiently adapt to its host device's available resources. We formulate this problem as learning an adaptively compressible network subspace, where one end is optimized for accuracy, and the other for efficiency. Our subspace model requires no recalibration nor retraining when changing compression levels. Moreover, our generic training framework is amenable to multiple forms of compression, and we present results for unstructured sparsity, structured sparsity, and quantization on a variety of architectures. We present models that require a single extra copy of network parameters, as well as models that require no extra parameters. Both models allow for operation at any compression level within a wide range (for example, 0% to 90% for structured sparsity with ResNet18 on ImageNet). At each compression level, our models achieve an accuracy comparable to a baseline model optimized for that particular compression level. To our knowledge, our method is the first to enable adaptive on-device network compression with little to no computational overhead."}

In object detection, the bias exists in the form of various imbalances such as class, background-foreground, and object size. In this paper, we denote size of an object as the number of pixels it covers in an image and size imbalance as the over-representation of certain sizes of objects in a dataset. We aim to address the problem of size imbalance in drone-based aerial image datasets. Existing methods for solving size imbalance are based on architectural changes that utilize multiple scales of images or feature maps for detecting objects of different sizes. We, on the other hand, propose a novel ARchitectUre-agnostic BAlanced Loss (ARUBA) that can be applied as a plugin on top of any object detection model. It follows a neighborhood-driven approach inspired by the ordinality of object size. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments on aerial datasets such as HRSC2016, DOTAv1.0, DOTAv1.5 and VisDrone and obtain consistent improvement in performance."}

A number of developed approaches are evolving with the goal of outperforming supervised alternatives, which have been relatively successful. Similar to some other disciplines in deep representation learning, one main issue in SSL is robustness of the approaches under different settings. In this paper, for the first time, we recognize the fundamental limits of SSL coming from the use of a single-supervisory signal. To address this limitation, we leverage the power of uncertainty representation to devise a robust and general standard hierarchical learning/training protocol for any SSL baseline, regard- less of their assumptions and approaches. Essentially, using the information bottleneck principle, we decompose feature learning into a two-stage training procedure, each with a distinct supervision signal. This double supervision approach is captured in two key steps: 1) invariance enforcement to data augmentation, and 2) fuzzy pseudo labeling (both hard and soft annotation). This simple, yet, effective protocol which enables cross-class/cluster feature learning, is instantiated via an initial training of an ensemble of models through invariance enforcement to data augmentation as first training phase, and then assigning fuzzy labels to the original samples for the second training phase. We consider multiple alternative scenarios with double supervision and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on recent baselines, covering four different SSL paradigms, including geometrical, contrastive, non-contrastive, and hard/soft whitening (redundancy reduction) baselines. We performed extensive experiments under multiple settings to show that the proposed training protocol consistently improves the performance of the former baselines, independent of their respective underlying principles."}

Models such as neural radiance fields (NeRF), which uses relatively small neural networks, can represent high-quality scenes and achieve state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. Training these types of networks, however, is still computationally expensive and the model struggles with real life 360 degree scenes. In this work, we propose the depth distribution neural radiance field (DDNeRF), a new method that significantly increases sampling efficiency along rays during training, while achieving superior results for a given sampling budget. DDNeRF achieves this performance by learning a more accurate representation of the density distribution along rays. More specifically, the proposed framework trains a coarse model to predict the internal distribution of the transparency of an input volume along each ray. This estimated distribution then guides the sampling procedure of the fine model. Our method allows using fewer samples during training while achieving better output quality with the same computational resources."}

The benchmark consists of 581 high-quality videos, which have 436K frames densely annotated with rotated bounding boxes for the targets spanning 74 object classes. The dataset is geared for development, evaluation and analysis of visual tracking algorithms that are robust to occlusions. It is comprised of videos with high occlusion levels, where the median percentage of occluded frames per-video is 68%. It also provides critical attributes on occlusions, which include defining a taxonomy for occluders, providing occlusion masks for every bounding box, per-frame partial/full occlusion labels and more. HOOT has been compiled to encourage development of new methods targeting occlusion handling in visual tracking, by providing training and test splits with high occlusion levels. This makes HOOT the first densely-annotated, large dataset designed for single-object tracking under severe occlusion. We evaluate 15 state-of-the-art trackers on this new dataset to act as a baseline for future work focusing on occlusions."}

We derive an efficient way to encode an input 3D point cloud to the latent space of the SP-GAN. Our point cloud encoder can resolve the point ordering issue during inversion, and thus can determine the correspondences between points in the generated 3D point cloud and those in the canonical sphere used by the generator.

The traditional wisdom in this space is to employ sign() for binarizing featuremaps. We argue and illustrate that sign() is a uniqueness bottleneck, limiting information propagation throughout the network. To alleviate this, we propose to dispense sign(), replacing it with a learnable activation binarizer (LAB), allowing the network to learn a fine-grained binarization kernel per layer - as opposed to global thresholding. LAB is a novel universal module that can seamlessly be integrated into existing architectures. To confirm this, we plug it into four seminal BNNs and show a considerable performance boost at the cost of tolerable increase in delay and complexity. Finally, we build an end-to-end BNN (coined as LAB-BNN) around LAB, and demonstrate that it achieves competitive performance on par with the state-of-the-art on ImageNet. Codebase in the supplementary will be made publicly available upon acceptance."}

We argue that this is because the rotated image is always treated as either positive or negative. The semantics of an image can be rotation-invariant or rotation-variant, so whether the rotated image is treated as positive or negative should be determined based on the content of the image. Therefore, we propose a novel augmentation strategy, adaptive Positive or Negative Data Augmentation (PNDA), in which an original and its rotated image are a positive pair if they are semantically close and a negative pair if they are semantically different. To achieve PNDA, we first determine whether rotation is positive or negative on an image-by-image basis in an unsupervised way. Then, we apply PNDA to contrastive learning frameworks. Our experiments showed that PNDA improves the performance of contrastive learning."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2023", "Area": "CV", "Where": "WACV", "Abbreviation": "Far3Det", "Title": "Towards Far-Field 3D Detection", "Abstract": "We focus on the task of far-field 3D detection (Far3Det) of objects beyond a certain distance from an observer, e.g., >50m. Far3Det is particularly important for autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating at highway speeds, which require detections of far-field obstacles to ensure sufficient braking distances. However, contemporary AV benchmarks such as nuScenes underemphasize this problem because they evaluate performance only up to a certain distance (50m). One reason is that obtaining far-field 3D annotations is difficult, particularly for lidar sensors that produce very few point returns for far-away objects. Indeed, we find that almost 50% of far-field objects (beyond 50m) contain zero lidar points. Secondly, current metrics for 3D detection employ a \"one-size-fits-all\" philosophy, using the same tolerance thresholds for near and far objects, inconsistent with tolerances for both human vision and stereo disparities. Both factors lead to an incomplete analysis of the Far3Det task. For example, while conventional wisdom tells us that high-resolution RGB sensors should be vital for the 3D detection of far-away objects, lidar-based methods still rank higher compared to RGB counterparts on the current benchmark leaderboards. As a first step towards a Far3Det benchmark, we develop a method to find well-annotated scenes from the nuScenes dataset and derive a well-annotated far-field validation set. We also propose a Far3Det evaluation protocol and explore various 3D detection methods for Far3Det. Our result convincingly justifies the long held conventional wisdom that high-resolution RGB improves 3D detection in the far-field. We further propose a simple yet effective method that fuses detections from RGB and lidar detectors based on non-maximum suppression, which remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art 3D detectors in the far-field."}

However, finding resources to learn or improve one's lipreading skills can be challenging. This is further exacerbated in the COVID19 pandemic due to restrictions on direct interactions with peers and speech therapists. Today, online MOOCs platforms like Coursera and Udemy have become the most effective form of training for many types of skill development. However, online lipreading resources are scarce as creating such resources is an extensive process needing months of manual effort to record hired actors. Because of the manual pipeline, such platforms are also limited in vocabulary, supported languages, accents, and speakers and have a high usage cost. In this work, we investigate the possibility of replacing real human talking videos with synthetically generated videos. Synthetic data can easily incorporate larger vocabularies, variations in accent, and even local languages and many speakers. We propose an end-to-end automated pipeline to develop such a platform using state-of-the-art talking head video generator networks, text-to-speech models, and computer vision techniques. We then perform an extensive human evaluation using carefully thought out lipreading exercises to validate the quality of our designed platform against the existing lipreading platforms. Our studies concretely point toward the potential of our approach in developing a large-scale lipreading MOOC platform that can impact millions of people with hearing loss."}

In this domain, low-rank approximation is a promising method, but existing solutions considered a restricted number of design choices and failed to efficiently explore the design space, which lead to severe accuracy degradation and limited compression ratio achieved. To address the above limitations, this work proposes the SVD-NAS framework that couples the domains of low-rank approximation and neural architecture search. SVD-NAS generalises and expands the design choices of previous works by introducing the Low-Rank architecture space, LR-space, which is a more fine-grained design space of low-rank approximation. Afterwards, this work proposes a gradient-descent-based search for efficiently traversing the LR-space. This finer and more thorough exploration of the possible design choices results in improved accuracy as well as reduction in parameters, FLOPS, and latency of a CNN model. Results demonstrate that the SVD-NAS achieves 2.06-12.85pp higher accuracy on ImageNet than state-of-the-art methods under the data-limited problem settings.

Many recently proposed approaches try to counter this by aligning the model to the new distribution prior to inference. With no labels available this requires unsupervised objectives to adapt the model on the observed test data. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Self-Training (TeST): a technique that takes as input a model trained on some source data and a novel data distribution at test time, and learns invariant and robust representations using a student-teacher framework. We find that models adapted using TeST significantly improve over baseline test-time adaptation algorithms. TeST achieves competitive performance to modern domain adaptation algorithms [4,43], while having access to 5-10x less data at time of adaption. We thoroughly evaluate a variety of baselines on two tasks: object detection and image segmentation and find that models adapted with TeST. We find that TeST sets the new state-of-the art for test-time domain adaptation algorithms."}

Preparation and training of deploy-able deep learning architectures require the models to be suited to different traffic scenarios and adapt to different situations. Currently, existing datasets, while large-scale, lack such diversities and are geographically biased towards mainly developed cities. An unstructured and complex driving layout found in several developing countries such as India poses a challenge to these models due to the sheer degree of variations in the object types, densities, and locations. To facilitate better research toward accommodating such scenarios, we build a new dataset,  IDD-3D , which consists of multi-modal data from multiple cameras and LiDAR sensors with 12k annotated driving LiDAR frames across various traffic scenarios. We discuss the need for this dataset through statistical comparisons with existing datasets and highlight benchmarks on standard 3D object detection and tracking tasks in complex layouts."}

The widely adopted activation function ReLU despite being simple and effective has few disadvantages including the Dying ReLU problem. In order to tackle such problems, we propose a novel activation function called Serf which is self-regularized and nonmonotonic in nature. Like Mish, Serf also belongs to the Swish family of functions. Based on several experiments on computer vision (image classification and object detection) and natural language processing (machine translation, sentiment classification and multimodal entailment) tasks with different state-of-the-art architectures, it is observed that Serf vastly outperforms ReLU (baseline) and other activation functions including both Swish and Mish, with a markedly bigger margin on deeper architectures. Ablation studies further demonstrate that Serf based architectures perform better than those of Swish and Mish in varying scenarios, validating the effectiveness and compatibility of Serf with varying depth, complexity, optimizers, learning rates, batch sizes, initializers and dropout rates. Finally, we investigate the mathematical relation between Swish and Serf, thereby showing the impact of preconditioner function ingrained in the first derivative of Serf which provides a regularization effect making gradients smoother and optimization faster."}

Precise localization of the AVEs is very challenging since it demands effective multi-modal feature correspondence to ground the short and long range temporal interactions. Existing approaches struggle in capturing the different scales of multi-modal interaction due to ineffective multi-modal training strategies. To overcome this limitation, we introduce AVE-CLIP, a novel framework that integrates the AudioCLIP pre-trained on large-scale audio-visual data with a multi-window temporal transformer to effectively operate on different temporal scales of video frames. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We introduce a multi-stage training framework to incorporate AudioCLIP pre-trained with audio-image pairs into the AVE localization task on video frames through contrastive fine-tuning, effective mean video feature extraction, and multi-scale training phases. (2) We propose a multi-domain attention mechanism that operates on both temporal and feature domains over varying timescales to fuse the local and global feature variations. (3) We introduce a temporal refining scheme with event-guided attention followed by a simple-yet-effective post processing step to handle significant variations of the background over diverse events.

In reality, these scenarios are not all represented in the model's training data, leading to poor performance. To tackle this, current training strategies attempt to either exploit additional unlabeled data with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), or to reduce overfitting using the limited available labeled data with domain generalization (DG). However, it is not clear from current literature which of these methods allows for better generalization to unseen data from the wild. Therefore, in this work, we present an evaluation framework in which the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art UDA and DG methods can be compared fairly. From this evaluation, we find that UDA methods, which leverage unlabeled data, outperform DG methods in terms of generalization, and can deliver similar performance on unseen data as fully-supervised training methods that require all data to be labeled. We show that semantic segmentation performance can be increased up to 30% for a priori unknown data without using any extra labeled data."}

PLS", "Title": "Robustness To Label Noise With Two Stage Detection", "Abstract": "Designing robust algorithms capable of training accurate neural networks on uncurated datasets from the web has been the subject of much research as it reduces the need for time consuming human labor. The focus of many previous research contributions has been on the detection of different types of label noise; however, this paper proposes to improve the correction accuracy of noisy samples once they have been detected. In many state-of-the-art contributions, a two phase approach is adopted where the noisy samples are detected before guessing a corrected pseudo-label in a semi-supervised fashion. The guessed pseudo-labels are then used in the supervised objective without ensuring that the label guess is likely to be correct. This can lead to confirmation bias, which reduces the noise robustness. Here we propose the pseudo-loss, a simple metric that we find to be strongly correlated with pseudo-label correctness on noisy samples. Using the pseudo-loss, we dynamically down weight under-confident pseudo-labels throughout training to avoid confirmation bias and improve the network accuracy. We additionally propose to use a confidence guided contrastive objective that learns robust representation on an interpolated objective between class bound (supervised) for confidently corrected samples and unsupervised representation for under-confident label corrections.

Existing public datasets for both face and license plate detection are either not focused on autonomous driving or only in parking lots.

The dataset is aggregated from visual data that is available in public domain, to cover scenarios from six European cities, including daytime and nighttime, annotated with both faces and license plates.

The tiny, fuzzy camouflaged objects result in visually indistinguishable properties. However, current single-view COD detectors are sensitive to background distractors. Therefore, blurred boundaries and variable shapes of the camouflaged objects are challenging to be fully captured with a single-view detector. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a behavior-inspired framework, called Multi-view Feature Fusion Network (MFFN), which mimics the human behaviors of finding indistinct objects in images, i.e., observing from multiple angles, distances, perspectives. Specifically, the key idea behind it is to generate multiple ways of observation (multi-view) by data augmentation and apply them as inputs. MFFN captures critical boundary and semantic information by comparing and fusing extracted multi-view features. In addition, our MFFN exploits the dependence and interaction between views and channels. Specifically, our methods leverage the complementary information between different views through a two-stage attention module called Co-attention of Multi-view (CAMV). And we design a local-overall module called Channel Fusion Unit (CFU) to explore the channel-wise contextual clues of diverse feature maps in an iterative manner. The experiment results show that our method performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art methods via training with the same data.

This paper focuses on texture images and considers how few normal samples are needed for accurate AD.

We then propose a zero-shot method, which detects anomalies without using a normal sample. The method is free from the issue of unaligned orientation between input and normal images. It assumes the input texture to be homogeneous, detecting image regions that break the homogeneity as anomalies. We present a quantitative criterion to judge whether this assumption holds for an input texture. Experimental results show the broad applicability of the proposed zero-shot method and its good performance comparable to or even higher than the state-of-the-art methods using hundreds of normal samples.

When humans ask questions about an image, their goal is often to acquire some new knowledge.

To introduce a knowledge acquisition perspective into VQG, we constructed a novel knowledge-aware VQG dataset called K-VQG. This is the first large, humanly annotated dataset in which questions regarding images are tied to structured knowledge. We also developed a new VQG model that can encode and use knowledge as the target for a question. The experiment results show that our model outperforms existing models on the K-VQG dataset.

Constructing a dataset with per-frame object region and consistent relationship annotations requires extremely high labor costs. Existing datasets sparsely annotate frames sampled from videos, resulting in the lack of dense spatio-temporal correlation in videos. Additionally, existing datasets contain inconsistent relationship annotations, leading to the problem of learning ambiguous temporal associations. Moreover, existing datasets mainly discuss relationships that can be inferred from a single frame, ignoring the significance of temporal associations. To resolve those issues, we created a simulated dataset with per-frame consistent annotations and introduced a range of relationships requiring both spatial and temporal context. Most existing methods explore spatial correlations within single images and do not explicitly consider the dynamic changes across frames. Therefore, we proposed a tracking-based approach that explicitly grasps spatio-temporal human-object interactions while simultaneously localizing humans and objects. Our proposed approach achieved state-of-the-art performance on scene graph generation and outperformed existing methods in scene graph localization by large margins on the proposed dataset. Moreover, the experiments show the efficacy of pre-training on the proposed dataset while adapting to a previous benchmark consisting of real daily videos, indicating the potential of the proposed dataset in real-world scenarios."}

Toward this goal, this paper proposes a new research direction of joint risk localization in driving scenes and its risk explanation as a natural language description. Due to the lack of standard benchmarks, we collected a large-scale dataset, DRAMA (Driving Risk Assessment Mechanism with A captioning module), which consists of 17,785 interactive driving scenarios collected in Tokyo, Japan. Our DRAMA dataset accommodates video- and object-level questions on driving risks with associated important objects to achieve the goal of visual captioning as a free-form language description utilizing closed and open-ended responses for multi-level questions, which can be used to evaluate a range of visual captioning capabilities in driving scenarios. We make this data available to the community for further research. Using DRAMA, we explore multiple facets of joint risk localization and captioning in interactive driving scenarios.

However, for an ever-growing range of applications, interpreting a model's prediction remains non-trivial. Understanding decisions made by black-box algorithms is critical, and assessing their fairness and susceptibility to bias is a key step towards healthcare deployment. In this paper, we propose DBCE (Deformation Based Counterfactual Explainability). We optimise a diffeomorphic transformation that deforms a given input image to change the prediction of the model. This provides anatomically meaningful saliency maps indicating tissue atrophy and expansion, which can be easily interpreted by clinicians. In our test case, DBCE replicates the transition of a patient from healthy control (HC) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We benchmark DBCE against three commonly used saliency methods. We show that it provides more meaningful saliency maps when applied to one subject and disease-consistent atrophy patterns when used over a larger cohort. In addition, our method fulfils a recent sanity check and is repeatable for different model initialisations in contrast to classical sensitivity-based methods."}

Event-based cameras have grown in popularity because of their biological inspiration and low power consumption. Despite this, applying local features directly to the event stream is difficult due to its peculiar data structure. We propose a new time-surface-like event stream representation method called Tencode. The event stream data processed by Tencode can obtain the pixel-level positioning of interest points while also simultaneously extracting descriptors through a neural network. Instead of using costly and unreliable manual annotation, our network leverages the prior knowledge of local feature extraction on color images and conducts self-supervised learning via homographic and spatio-temporal adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first research on event-based local features learning using a deep neural network. We provide comprehensive experiments of feature point detection and matching, and three public datasets are used for evaluation (i.e. DSEC, N-Caltech101, and HVGA ATIS Corner Dataset). The experimental findings demonstrate that our method outperforms SOTA in terms of feature point detection and description."}

Many papers train one model for each scene respectively and few of them explore incorporating multi-modal data into this problem. In this paper, we focus on a rarely discussed but important setting: can we train one model that can represent multiple scenes, with 360deg insufficient views and RGB-D images? We refer insufficient views to few extremely sparse and almost non-overlapping views. To deal with it, X-NeRF, a fully explicit approach which learns a general scene completion process instead of a coordinate-based mapping, is proposed. Given a few insufficient RGB-D input views, X-NeRF first transforms them to a sparse point cloud tensor and then applies a 3D sparse generative Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to complete it to an explicit radiance field whose volumetric rendering can be conducted fast without running networks during inference. To avoid overfitting, besides common rendering loss, we apply perceptual loss as well as view augmentation through random rotation on point clouds. The proposed methodology significantly out-performs previous implicit methods in our setting, indicating the great potential of proposed problem and approach.

However, DNNs are notoriously fragile to the class imbalance in image classification. We further point out that such imbalance fragility can be amplified when it comes to more sophisticated tasks such as pathology localization, as imbalances in such problems can have highly complex and often implicit forms of presence. For example, different pathology can have different sizes or colors (w.r.t.the background), different underlying demographic distributions, and in general different difficulty levels to recognize, even in a meticulously curated balanced distribution of training data. In this paper, we propose to use pruning to automatically and adaptively identify hard-to-learn (HTL) training samples, and improve pathology localization by attending them explicitly, during training in supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly-supervised settings. Our main inspiration is drawn from the recent finding that deep classification models have difficult-to-memorize samples and those may be effectively exposed through network pruning - and we extend such observation beyond classification for the first time. We also present interesting demographic analysis which illustrates HTLs ability to capture complex demographic imbalances. Our extensive experiments on the Skin Lesion Localization task in multiple training settings by paying additional attention to HTLs show significant improvement of localization performance by  2-3%."}

Here, the challenges related to underlying detection and re-identification tasks need to be addressed along with a joint optimization of these two tasks. In this paper, we propose a three-stage cascaded Scale-Augmented Transformer (SAT) person search framework. In the three-stage design of our SAT framework, the first stage performs person detection whereas the last two stages performs both detection and re-identification. Considering the contradictory nature of detection and identification, in the last two stages, we introduce separate norm feature embeddings for the two tasks to reconcile the relationship between them in a joint person search model. Our SAT framework benefits from the attributes of convolutional neural networks and transformers by introducing a convolutional encoder and a scale modulator within each stage. Here, the convolutional encoder increases the generalization ability of the model whereas the scale modulator performs context aggregation at different granularity levels to aid in handling pose/scale variations within a region of interest. To further improve the performance during occlusion, we apply shifting augmentation operations at each granularity level within the scale modulator. Experimental results on challenging CUHK-SYSU [35] and PRW [47] datasets demonstrate the favorable performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Our approach addresses several challenges of existing methods. Firstly, it is end-to-end differentiable despite the generally discrete nature of graph construction. Secondly, it allows inductive inference at no extra cost. Thirdly, it presents a simple method to construct graphs from arbitrary datasets that captures both example level and class level information. Finally, it addresses the proxy collapse problem by combining contrastive and cross-entropy losses rather than separate clustering algorithms. Our results increase classification performance over baseline experiments and outperform other methods. We also conduct an empirical investigation showing that Transformer style attention scales better than GAT attention with dataset size."}

Complementary images in the reference set can improve the generated headshot quality across many different views and poses. However, it is challenging to make the best use of multiple exemplars: the quality and alignment of each exemplar cannot be guaranteed. Using low-quality and mismatched images as references will impair the output results. To overcome these issues, we propose the efficient Headshot Image Super-Resolution with Multiple Exemplars network (HIME) method. Compared with previous methods, our network can effectively handle the misalignment between the input and the reference without requiring facial priors and learn the aggregated reference set representation in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, to reconstruct more detailed facial features, we propose a correlation loss that provides a rich representation of the local texture in a controllable spatial range. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only has significantly fewer computation cost than recent exemplar-guided methods but also achieves better qualitative and quantitative performance."}

A multi-task framework is favorable for sharing information across tasks under restricted computational resources. However, tasks not only share information but may also compete for resources and conflict with each other, making the optimization of shared parameters difficult and leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a simple but effective training scheme called GradSplit that alleviates this issue by utilizing asymmetric inter-task relations. Specifically, at each convolution module, it splits features into T groups for T tasks and trains each group only using the gradient back-propagated from the task losses with which it does not have conflicts. During training, we apply GradSplit to a series of convolution modules. As a result, each module is trained to generate a set of task-specific features using the shared features from the previous module. This enables a network to use complementary information across tasks while circumventing gradient conflicts. Experimental results show that GradSplit achieves a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than existing methods. It minimizes accuracy drop caused by task conflicts while significantly saving compute resources in terms of both FLOPs and memory at inference. We further show that GradSplit achieves higher cross-dataset accuracy compared to single-task and other multi-task networks."}

However, most existing studies focus on single point cloud frames without harnessing the temporal information in point cloud sequences. In this paper, we design TransPillars, a novel transformer-based feature aggregation technique that exploits temporal features of consecutive point cloud frames for multi-frame 3D object detection. TransPillars aggregates spatial-temporal point cloud features from two perspectives. First, it fuses voxel-level features directly from multi-frame feature maps instead of pooled instance features to preserve instance details with contextual information that are essential to accurate object localization. Second, it introduces a hierarchical coarse-to-fine strategy to fuse multi-scale features progressively to effectively capture the motion of moving objects and guide the aggregation of fine features. Besides, a variant of deformable transformer is introduced to improve the effectiveness of cross-frame feature matching. Extensive experiments show that our proposed TransPillars achieves state-of-art performance as compared to existing multi-frame detection approaches."}

These variations are subtle, imperceptible to human eyes, and easily affected by noise. Existing deep learning-based rPPG estimators are incompetent due to three reasons. Firstly, they suppress the noise by utilizing information from the whole face even though different facial regions contain different noise characteristics. Secondly, local noise characteristics inherently affect the convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Lastly, the CNN sequential architectures fail to preserve long temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose RADIANT, that is, rPPG estimation using Signal Embeddings and Transformer. Our Transformer utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism that facilitates the feature subspace learning to extract the multiple correlations among the color variations corresponding to the periodic pulse. Also, its global information processing ability helps to suppress local noise characteristics. Apart from Transformer, we propose novel signal embedding to enhance the rPPG feature representation and suppress noise. We have also improved the generalization of our architecture by adding a new training set. To this end, the effectiveness of synthetic temporal signals and data augmentations were explored.

Specifically, our method first encodes image features from arbitrary cameras with a shared backbone. These image features are then enhanced by a deformable transformer-based encoder. Moreover, we introduce a BEV transformer decoder module to parse BEV semantic segmentation results. An efficient multi-camera deformable attention unit is designed to carry out the BEV-to-image view transformation. Finally, the queries are reshaped according the layout of grids in the BEV, and upsampled to produce the semantic segmentation result in a supervised manner. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on the public nuScenes dataset and a self-collected dataset.

However, endowing mobile agents with such a spatial sensing ability is still a challenge, due to two difficulties: (1) the previous convolutional models are limited by the local receptive field, thus, struggling to capture holistic long-range dependencies during observation; (2) the excessive computational budgets required for success, often lead to a separation of the mapping pipeline into stages, resulting the entire mapping process inefficient. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end one-stage Transformer-based framework for Mapping, termed Trans4Map. Our egocentric-to-allocentric mapping process includes three steps: (1) the efficient transformer extracts the contextual features from a batch of egocentric images; (2) the proposed Bidirectional Allocentric Memory (BAM) module projects egocentric features into the allocentric memory; (3) the map decoder parses the accumulated memory and predicts the top-down semantic segmentation map.

To this end, we propose our Reconstruction by Encoding Facial Priors (ReEnFP) pipeline to exploit the potential of unconstrained facial images for further improvement. Our key is to encode generative priors learned by a style-based texture generator on unconstrained data for fast and detail-preserving face reconstruction. With our texture generator pre-trained using a differentiable renderer, faces could be encoded to its latent space as opposed to the time-consuming optimization-based inversion. Our generative prior encoding is further enhanced with a pyramid fusion block for adaptive integration of input spatial information.

UDA adapts models trained on normal conditions to the target adverse-condition domains. Meanwhile, multiple datasets with driving scenes provide corresponding images of the same scenes across multiple conditions, which can serve as a form of weak supervision for domain adaptation. We propose Refign, a generic extension to self-training-based UDA methods which leverages these cross-domain correspondences. Refign consists of two steps: (1) aligning the normal-condition image to the corresponding adverse-condition image using an uncertainty-aware dense matching network, and (2) refining the adverse prediction with the normal prediction using an adaptive label correction mechanism. We design custom modules to streamline both steps and set the new state of the art for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on several adverse-condition benchmarks, including ACDC and Dark Zurich. The approach introduces no extra training parameters, minimal computational overhead--during training only--and can be used as a drop-in extension to improve any given self-training-based UDA method.

The reference images are usually retrieved via similarity search using global descriptor, and the local descriptors are used to re-rank the initial retrieved candidates. The local descriptors re-ranking can significantly improve the accuracy of global retrieval but comes at a high computational cost. To achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose an Efficient Transformer for Re-ranking (ETR), utilizing both global and local descriptors to re-rank the top candidates in a single shot. In contrast to traditional re-ranking methods, we leverage self-attention to capture relationships between local descriptors in a single image and cross-attention to explore the similarity of the image pairs. We show that the proposed model can be regarded as a general re-ranking algorithm for significantly boosting the performance of other global-only retrieval methods.

However, there are times when unexpected and severe weather occurs in outdoor environments, making the detection tasks less effective and unexpected. In this case, additional sensors like lidar and radar are adopted to help the camera work in bad weather. However, existing multimodal detection methods do not consider the characteristics of different vehicle sensors to complement each other. Therefore, a novel end-to-end multimodal multistage object detection network called MT-DETR is proposed. Unlike the unimodal object detection networks, MT-DETR adds fusion modules and enhancement modules and adopts a hierarchical fusion mechanism. The Residual Fusion Module (RFM) and Confidence Fusion Module (CFM) are designed to fuse camera, lidar, radar, and time features. The Residual Enhancement Module (REM) reinforces each unimodal branch while a multistage loss is introduced to strengthen each branch's effectiveness. The synthesis algorithm for generating camera-lidar data pairs in foggy conditions further boosts the performance in unseen adverse weather. Extensive experiments on various weather conditions of the STF dataset demonstrate that MT-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

This simple approach, PatchDropout, reduces FLOPs and memory by at least 50% in standard natural image datasets such as ImageNet, and those savings only increase with image size. On CSAW, a high-resolution medical dataset, we observe a 5x savings in computation and memory using PatchDropout, along with a boost in performance. For practitioners with a fixed computational or memory budget, PatchDropout makes it possible to choose image resolution, hyperparameters, or model size to get the most performance out of their model."}

In this paper, we customize a novel dual-stream Transformer (DSTrans) for HSI restoration, which mainly consists of the dual-stream attention and the dual-stream feed-forward network. Specifically, we develop the dual-stream attention consisting of Multi-Dconv-head spectral attention (MDSA) and Multi-head Spatial self-attention (MSSA). MDSA and MSSA respectively calculate self-attention along the spectral and spatial dimensions in local windows to capture long-range spectrum dependencies and model global spatial interactions.

To address this, coarse-to-fine or recurrent processing of the cost volume is usually adopted, where correspondence sampling in a local neighborhood with a small radius suffices. In this paper, we propose an alternative by constructing cost volumes with different dilation factors to capture small and large displacements simultaneously. A U-Net with sikp connections is employed to convert the dilated cost volumes into interpolation weights between all possible captured displacements to get the optical flow. Our proposed model DCVNet only needs to process the cost volume once in a simple feedforward manner and does not rely on the sequential processing strategy. DCVNet obtains comparable accuracy to existing approaches and achieves real-time inference (30 fps on a mid-end 1080ti GPU)."}

Yet, these two axes are heterogeneous and challenging to fully explore. Existing works craft point operator under a single axis and reuse the crafted operator in all parts of 3D models. This overlooks the opportunity to better combine point interactions and dimensions by exploiting varying geometry/density of 3D point clouds. In this work, we establish PIDS, a novel paradigm to jointly explore point interactions and point dimensions to serve semantic segmentation on point cloud data. We establish a large search space to jointly consider versatile point interactions and point dimensions. This supports point operators with various geometry/density considerations. The enlarged search space with heterogeneous search components calls for a better ranking of candidate models. To achieve this, we improve the search space exploration by leveraging predictor-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS), and enhance the quality of prediction by assigning unique encoding to heterogeneous search components based on their priors. We thoroughly evaluate the networks crafted by PIDS on two semantic segmentation benchmarks, showing  1% mIOU improvement on SemanticKITTI and S3DIS over state-of-the-art 3D models."}

This dataset is created using cross-calibrated mmWave radar sensors and a monocular RGB camera for cross-modality training of radar-based human pose estimation. There are two advantages of using mmWave radar to perform human pose estimation. First, it is robust to dark and low-light conditions. Second, it is not visually perceivable by humans and therefore, can be widely applied to applications with privacy concerns, e.g., surveillance systems in patient rooms. In addition to the benchmark, we propose a cross-modality training framework that leverages the ground-truth 2D keypoints representing human body joints for training, which are systematically generated from the pre-trained 2D pose estimation network based on a monocular camera input image, avoiding laborious manual label annotation efforts. The framework consists of a new radar pre-processing method that better extracts the velocity information from radar data, Cross- and Self-Attention Module (CSAM), to fuse multi-scale radar features, and Pose Refinement Graph Convolutional Networks (PRGCN), to refine the predicted keypoint confidence heatmaps. Our intensive experiments on the HuPR benchmark show that the proposed scheme achieves better human pose estimation performance with only radar data, as compared to traditional pre-processing solutions and previous radio-frequency-based methods. Our proposed scheme further outperforms state-of-the-art pointcloud-based methods."}

The primary challenge is how to precisely place the pixels from the reference image into the hole region. Therefore, understanding the 3D geometry that relates pixels between two views is a crucial step towards building a better model. Given the complexity of handling various types of reference images, we focus on the scenario where the images are captured by freely moving the same camera around. Compared to the previous work, we propose a principled approach that does not make heuristic assumptions about the planarity of the scene. We leverage a monocular depth estimate and predict relative pose between cameras, then align the reference image to the target by a differentiable 3D reprojection and a joint optimization of relative pose and depth map scale and offset. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both RealEstate10K and MannequinChallenge dataset with large baselines, complex geometry and extreme camera motions. We experimentally verify our approach is also better at handling large holes."}

For each pixel in the reference image, our method leverages a deep architecture to search for the corresponding point in the source image directly along the corresponding epipolar line. We denote our method DELS-MVS: Deep Epipolar Line Search Multi-View Stereo. Previous works in deep MVS select a range of interest within the depth space, discretize it, and sample the epipolar line according to the resulting depth values: this can result in an uneven scanning of the epipolar line, hence of the image space. Instead, our method works directly on the epipolar line: this guarantees an even scanning of the image space and avoids both the need to select a depth range of interest, which is often not known a priori and can vary dramatically from scene to scene, and the need for a suitable discretization of the depth space. In fact, our search is iterative, which avoids the building of a cost volume, costly both to store and to process. Finally, our method performs a robust geometry-aware fusion of the estimated depth maps, leveraging a confidence predicted alongside each depth. We test DELS-MVS on the ETH3D, Tanks and Temples and DTU benchmarks and achieve competitive results with respect to state-of-the-art approaches."}

While the uplifting methods themselves are rather efficient, the true computational complexity depends on the per-frame 2D pose estimation. In this paper, we present a Transformer-based pose uplifting scheme that can operate on temporally sparse 2D pose sequences but still produce temporally dense 3D pose estimates. We show how masked token modeling can be utilized for temporal upsampling within Transformer blocks. This allows to decouple the sampling rate of input 2D poses and the target frame rate of the video and drastically decreases the total computational complexity. Additionally, we explore the option of pre-training on large motion capture archives, which has been largely neglected so far. We evaluate our method on two popular benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. With an MPJPE of 45.0 mm and 46.9 mm, respectively, our proposed method can compete with the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by a factor of 12.

Existing learning-based methods majorly work for specific garment type (e.g. t-shirt, skirt, etc) or garment topology, and needs retraining for a new type of garment. Similarly, some methods focus on a particular fabric, body shape, and pose. To circumvent these limitations, our method fundamentally learns the physical dynamics of the garment vertices conditioned on underlying body shape, motion, and fabric properties to generalize across garment types, topology, and fabric along with different body shape and pose. In particular, we represent the garment as a graph, where the nodes represent the physical state of the garment vertices, and the edges represent the relation between the two nodes. The nodes and edges of the garment graph encode various properties of garments and the human body to compute the dynamics of the vertices through a learned message-passing. Learning of such dynamics of the garment vertices conditioned on underlying body motion and fabric properties enables our method to be trained simultaneously for multiple types of garments (e.g., tops, skirts, etc) with arbitrary mesh resolutions, varying topologies, and fabric properties. Our experimental results show that GarSim with less amount of training data not only outperforms the SOTA methods on challenging CLOTH3D dataset both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also works reliably well on the unseen poses obtained from YouTube videos, and give satisfactory results on unseen cloth types which were not present during the training."}

In contrast to motion transfer, the objective here is not to imitate the source's motions by the target, but rather to replace the walking source with the target, while transferring the target's typical gait. Our approach can be trained only once with multiple sources and is able to transfer the gait of the target from unseen sources, eliminating the need for retraining for each new source independently. Furthermore, we propose a novel metrics for gait transfer based on gait recognition models that enable to quantify the quality of the transferred gait, and show that existing techniques yield a discrepancy that can be easily detected.\\nWe introduce Cycle Transformers GAN (CTrGAN), that consist of a decoder and encoder, both Transformers, where the attention is on the temporal domain between complete images rather than the spatial domain between patches.

Currently, this is formulated as an automatic disease segmentation task addressed via deep learning frameworks. These deep leaning frameworks trained with leaf image data in a supervised paradigm have few limitations, mainly: (1) training datasets are heavily imbalanced towards healthy leaf images, (2) disease region annotation is labour-intensive and (3) due to the heterogeneity of disease symptoms, these frameworks lacks generalisability. In this paper, we reformulate disease segmentation as an anomaly localisation task. Specifically, we introduce a novel unsupervised framework (AnoLeaf) based on an edge-guided inpainting that optimises the learning of contextual attention on only healthy leaf images. The network utilisation on diseased leaf images results in reconstruction of its healthy counterparts, generating an inpainting error. The contextual attention maps reinforce the inpainting error to effectively localise the disease. Thus, AnoLeaf alleviates the acquisition and annotation of rare disease images. Additional experiments on MVTec anomaly detection dataset further demonstrate its generalisability."}

State-of-the-art guided approaches require additional processing for spatial and temporal alignment of multi-modal inputs, and sophisticated architectures for data fusion, making them non-trivial for customized sensor setup. To address these limitations, we propose an unguided approach based on UNet that is invariant to sparsity of inputs. Boundary consistency in reconstruction is explicitly enforced through auxiliary learning on a synthetic dataset with dense depth and depth contour images as targets, followed by fine-tuning on a real-world dataset. With our network architecture and simple implementation approach, we achieve competitive results among unguided approaches on KITTI benchmark and show that the reconstructed image has sharp boundaries and is robust even towards extremely sparse LiDAR measurements."}

Many works were dedicated to this topic, but randomized smoothing has been recently proven to be an effective approach for the certified defense of deep neural networks and getting robust classifiers. Some prior results were obtained utilizing the techniques of adding extra parameters to extend the limits of the certification regions. In this way, sample-wise optimization was proposed to maximize the certification radius per input. The idea was further extended with the generalized anisotropic counterparts of l1 and l2 certificates which allow achieving larger certified region volume avoiding worst-case certification near potentially larger safe regions. However, anisotropic certification is limited by the aligned axis lacking the freedom to extend in any direction. To mitigate this constraint, in this work, we (i) revisit the anisotropic certification, provide an analysis of its non-axis aligned counterpart and propose its rotation-free extension, (ii) conduct experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset to report the improved performance."}

In addition to achieving reliable accuracy, a critical subtask for these models is to detect Out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Given the nature of the deployment environment, one may expect such OOD inputs to also be fine-grained w.r.t. the known classes (e.g., a novel bird species), which are thus extremely difficult to identify. Unfortunately, OOD detection in fine-grained scenarios remains largely underexplored. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by first carefully constructing four large-scale fine-grained test environments, in which existing methods are shown to have difficulties. Particularly, we find that even explicitly incorporating a diverse set of auxiliary outlier data during training does not provide sufficient coverage over the broad region where fine-grained OOD samples locate. We then propose Mixture Outlier Exposure (MixOE), which mixes ID data and training outliers to expand the coverage of different OOD granularities, and trains the model such that the prediction confidence linearly decays as the input transitions from ID to OOD. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of MixOE for building up OOD detector in fine-grained environments. The code is available at https://github.com/zjysteven/MixOE."}

Along with tackling these challenges, an efficient VPR technique must also be practical in real-world scenarios where latency matters. To address this, we introduce MixVPR, a new holistic feature aggregation technique that takes feature maps from pre-trained backbones as a set of global features. Then, it incorporates a global relationship between elements in each feature map in a cascade of feature mixing, eliminating the need for local or pyramidal aggregation as done in NetVLAD or TransVPR. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through extensive experiments on multiple large-scale benchmarks. Our method outperforms all existing techniques by a large margin while having less than half the number of parameters compared to CosPlace and NetVLAD.

First, we present an efficient \"select\" module that automatically filters out the outlier source samples to avoid negative transfer while aligning distributions across both domains. Second, the \"label\" module iteratively trains the classifier using both the labeled source domain data and the generated pseudo-labels for the target domain to enhance the discriminability of the latent space.

Our network comprises two stages; namely the features extraction stage and the reconstruction stage. In the features extraction stage, a Keypoint RCNN is used to extract 2D poses, features maps, heatmaps, and bounding boxes from a monocular RGB image. Thereafter, this 2D information is modeled as two graphs and passed to the two branches of the reconstruction stage. The shape reconstruction branch estimates meshes of two hands and an object using our novel coarse-to-fine GraFormer shape network. The 3D poses of the hands and objects are reconstructed by the other branch using a GraFormer network.

To address this issue, we propose a method, Meta-learning-based Open-set Recognition via Generative Adversarial Network (MORGAN), that can learn a finer separation between the closed and the open spaces. MORGAN seeks to generate class-conditioned adversarial samples for both the closed and open spaces in the few-shot regime using two GANs by judiciously tuning noise variance while ensuring discriminability using a novel Anti-Overlap Latent (AOL) regularizer. Adversarial samples from low noise variance amplify known class data density, and we use samples from high noise variance to augment known-unknowns. A first-order episodic strategy is adapted to ensure stability in the GAN training.

However, while the self-attention models fail to incorporate the global context due to the limited size of the receptive fields, cross-attention learning may generate ambiguous features as the feature extractors for all the modalities are jointly trained. This results in the generation of redundant multi-modal features, thus limiting the fusion performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel fusion architecture called Global Attention based Fusion Network (GAF-Net), equipped with novel self and cross-attention learning techniques. We introduce the within-modality feature refinement module through global spectral-spatial attention learning using the query-key-value processing where both the global spatial and channel contexts are used to generate two channel attention masks. Since it is non-trivial to generate the cross-attention from within the fusion network, we propose to leverage two auxiliary tasks of modality-specific classification to produce highly discriminative cross-attention masks. Finally, to ensure non-redundancy, we propose to penalize the high correlation between attended modality-specific features.

Previous work is mainly built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn domain-invariant representations. With the recent exponential increase in applying Vision Transformer (ViT) to vision tasks, the capability of ViT in adapting cross-domain knowledge, however, remains unexplored in the literature. To fill this gap, this paper first comprehensively investigates the performance of ViT on a variety of domain adaptation tasks. Surprisingly, ViT demonstrates superior generalization ability, while the performance can be further improved by incorporating adversarial adaptation. Notwithstanding, directly using CNNs-based adaptation strategies fails to take the advantage of ViT's intrinsic merits (e.g., attention mechanism and sequential image representation) which play an important role in knowledge transfer. To remedy this, we propose an unified framework, namely Transferable Vision Transformer (TVT), to fully exploit the transferability of ViT for domain adaptation. Specifically, we delicately devise a novel and effective unit, which we term Transferability Adaption Module (TAM). By injecting learned transferabilities into attention blocks, TAM compels ViT focus on both transferable and discriminative features. Besides, we leverage discriminative clustering to enhance feature diversity and separation which are undermined during adversarial domain alignment. To verify its versatility, we perform extensive studies of TVT on four benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that TVT attains significant improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art UDA methods."}

We propose a modular and flexible system to efficiently find high-quality match cut candidates starting from millions of shot pairs. We annotate and release a dataset of approximately 20,000 labeled pairs that we use to evaluate our system, using both classification and metric learning approaches that leverage a variety of image, video, audio, and audio-visual feature extractors.

Essential to our framework is the realization that the accuracy, rather than the density, of pixel flows is what is required for high-quality video enhancement. Most of prior works take the opposite approach: they estimate dense (per-pixel)--but generally less robust--flows, mostly using computationally costly algorithms. Instead, we propose a lightweight flow estimation algorithm; it fuses the sparse point cloud data and (even sparser and less reliable) IMU data available in modern autonomous agents to estimate the flow information. Building on top of the flow estimation, we demonstrate a general framework that integrates the flows in a plug-and-play fashion with different task-specific layers. Algorithms built in our framework achieve 1.78x -- 187.41x speedup while providing a 0.42dB - 6.70 dB quality improvement over competing methods."}

Due to zero point-to-point correspondences between the sampled CAD model and the scanned real-world object, an information-rich representation of point clouds is needed. We propose SGPCR, a novel method for representing 3D point clouds by Spherical Gaussians for efficient, stable, and rotation-equivariant representation. We also propose a rotation-invariant convolution to improve the representation quality through a trainable optimization process. In addition, we demonstrate the strengths of SGPCR-based point cloud representation using the fundamental challenge of shape retrieval and point cloud registration on point clouds with zero point-to-point correspondences. Under these conditions, our approach improves registration quality by reducing chamfer distance by up to 90% and rotation root mean square error by up to 86% compared to the state of the art. Furthermore, the proposed SGCPR is used for one-shot shape retrieval and registration and improves retrieval precision by up to 58% over comparable methods."}

However, the core challenge of this task still is the enormous shape variation within each category. With regard to the challenge, we propose a novel framework SD-Pose, which utilizes the instance-category structural discrepancy and the potential geometric-semantic association to enhance the exploration of the intra-class shape information. Specifically, an information exchange augmentation (IEA) module is introduced to supplement the instance-category structural information by their structural discrepancy, thus facilitating the enhanced geometric information to contain both the character of instance shape and the commonality of category structure. For complementing the deficiencies of structural information adaptively, a semantic dynamic fusion (SDF) module is further designed to fuse semantic and geometric features. Finally, the proposed SD-Pose framework equipped with the IEA and SDF modules hierarchically supplements instance-category structural information in a stacked manner and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMERA25 and REAL275 datasets."}

These layers require additional parameters and are hyperparameter sensitive. They significantly increase training time, memory cost, and potential latency which can be costly for resource-limited or real-time applications. In this paper, we present a fast learnable once-for-all adversarial training (FLOAT) algorithm, which instead of the existing FiLM-based conditioning, presents a unique weight conditioned learning that requires no additional layer, thereby incurring no significant increase in parameter count, training time, or network latency compared to standard adversarial training. In particular, we add configurable scaled noise to the weight tensors that enables a trade-off between clean and adversarial performance. Extensive experiments show that FLOAT can yield SOTA performance improving both clean and perturbed image classification by up to  6% and  10%, respectively. Moreover, real hardware measurement shows that FLOAT can reduce the training time by up to 1.43x with fewer model parameters of up to 1.47x on iso-hyperparameter settings compared to the FiLM-based alternatives. Additionally, to further improve memory efficiency we introduce FLOAT sparse (FLOATS), a form of non-iterative model pruning, and provide detailed empirical analysis in yielding a three-way accuracy-robustness-complexity trade-off for these new class of pruned conditionally trained models."}

Previous methods like pSp have shown promising results by leveraging StyleGAN as a generator in various I2I tasks but they seem to miss finer or under-represented details in facial images like earrings and caps, and break down on complex datasets due to their solely global approach. To address these shortcomings, we propose a technique termed Spatial Layout Injection (SLI-pSp) that encodes spatial layout information in the input image in the StyleGAN generator along with style. We do so without modifying the style vector injection in the generator through pSp's map2style network, but rather by combining SLI with noise layers in the StyleGAN generator at multiple spatial scales. Such an approach helps preserve global aspects of image generation as well as enhance spatial layout details in the output. We experiment on several challenging datasets and across several I2I tasks that highlight the effectiveness of our approach over previous methods with respect to finer details in the generated image and overall visual quality."}

This is different from anomaly detection that aims to divide anomalies from normal data. Unlike object-centered image clustering, anomaly clustering is particularly challenging as anomalous patterns are subtle and local. We present a simple yet effective clustering framework using a patch-based pretrained deep embeddings and off-the-shelf clustering methods. We define a distance function between images, each of which is represented as a bag of embeddings, by the Euclidean distance between weighted averaged embeddings. The weight defines the importance of instances (i.e., patch embeddings) in the bag, which may highlight defective regions. We compute weights in an unsupervised way or in a semi-supervised way when labeled normal data is available. Extensive experimental studies show the effectiveness of the proposed clustering framework along with a novel distance function upon exist-ing multiple instance or deep clustering frameworks. Over-all, our framework achieves 0.451 and 0.674 normalized mutual information scores on MVTec object and texture categories and further improve with a few labeled normal data (0.577, 0.669), far exceeding the baselines (0.244, 0.273) or state-of-the-art deep clustering methods (0.176, 0.277)."}

In the many-to-many setting, an additional guidance example from the target domain is used to determine the domain-specific factors of variation of the generated image. In the absence of attribute annotations, methods have to infer which factors of variation are specific to each domain from data during training. In this paper, we show that many state-of-the-art architectures implicitly treat textures and colors as always being domain-specific, and thus fail when they are not. We propose a new method called RIFT that does not rely on such inductive architectural biases and instead infers which attributes are domain-specific vs shared directly from data. As a result, RIFT achieves consistently high cross-domain manipulation accuracy across multiple datasets spanning a wide variety of domain-specific and shared factors of variation."}

Knowledge distillation (KD), on the other hand, is widely used for model compression and transfer learning, which involves using a larger network's implicit knowledge to guide the learning of a smaller network. At first glance, these two techniques seem very different, however, we found that \"smoothness\" is the connecting link between the two and is also a crucial attribute in understanding KD's interplay with mixup. Although many mixup variants and distillation methods have been proposed, much remains to be understood regarding the role of a mixup in knowledge distillation. In this paper, we present a detailed empirical study on various important dimensions of compatibility between mixup and knowledge distillation. We also scrutinize the behavior of the networks trained with a mixup in the light of knowledge distillation through extensive analysis, visualizations, and comprehensive experiments on image classification. Finally, based on our findings, we suggest improved strategies to guide the student network to enhance its effectiveness.

In this paper, we revisit these training-free metrics and find that: (1) the number of parameters (#Param), which is the most straightforward training-free metric, is overlooked in previous works but is surprisingly effective, (2) recent training-free metrics largely rely on the #Param information to rank networks. Our experiments show that the performance of recent training-free metrics drops dramatically when the #Param information is not available. Motivated by these observations, we argue that metrics less correlated with the #Param are desired to provide additional information for NAS. We propose a light-weight training-based metric which has a weak correlation with the #Param while achieving better performance than training-free metrics at a lower search cost. Specifically, on DARTS search space, our method completes searching directly on ImageNet in only 2.6 GPU hours and achieves a top-1/top-5 error rate of 24.1%/7.1%, which is competitive among state-of-the-art NAS methods."}

Current methods only take two consecutive images as input, which is challenging to capture temporal coherence and reason about occluded regions. In this paper, we propose a novel optical flow estimation framework, namely MFCFlow, which attempts to compensate for the information of occlusions by mining and transferring motion features between multiple frames. Specifically, we construct a Motion-guided Feature Compensation cell (MFC cell) to enhance the ambiguous motion features according to the correlation of previous features obtained by attention-based structure. Furthermore, a TopK attention strategy is developed and embedded into the MFC cell to improve the subsequent matching quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MFCFlow achieves significant improvements in occluded regions and attains state-of-the-art performances on both Sintel and KITTI benchmarks among other multi-frame optical flow methods."}

However, in applications with constrained resources, an agent may not be able to observe the complete frame, yet must still locate useful glimpses to predict an incomplete action based on local information only. In this paper, we develop Glimpse Transformers (GliTr), which observe only narrow glimpses at all times, thus predicting an ongoing action and the following most informative glimpse location based on the partial spatiotemporal information collected so far. In the absence of a ground truth for the optimal glimpse locations for action recognition, we train GliTr using a novel spatiotemporal consistency objective: We require GliTr to attend to the glimpses with features similar to the corresponding complete frames (i.e. spatial consistency) and the resultant class logits at time t equivalent to the ones predicted using whole frames up to t (i.e. temporal consistency). Inclusion of our proposed consistency objective yields  10% higher accuracy on the Something-Something-v2 (SSv2) dataset than the baseline cross-entropy objective. Overall, despite observing only  33% of the total area per frame, GliTr achieves 53.02% and 93.91% accuracy on the SSv2 and Jester datasets, respectively."}

Despite its popularity and universality, such a straightforward paradigm is sensitive to slight numerical deviations, especially in localization. By exploiting the property that point clouds are naturally captured on the surface of objects along with accurate location and intensity information, we introduce a new perspective that views bounding box regression as an implicit function. This leads to our proposed framework, termed Implicit Detection or ImpDet, which leverages implicit field learning for 3D object detection. Our ImpDet assigns specific values to points in different local 3D spaces, thereby high-quality boundaries can be generated by classifying points inside or outside the boundary. To solve the problem of sparsity on the object surface, we further present a simple yet efficient virtual sampling strategy to not only fill the empty region, but also learn rich semantic features to help refine the boundaries. Extensive experimental results on KITTI and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of unifying implicit fields into object detection."}

While in the few-shot setup we observe that transformer-based object detectors perform better than convolution-based two-stage models for a similar amount of parameters, they are not as effective when used with recent approaches in the semi-supervised setting. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised method tailored for the current state-of-the-art object detector Deformable DETR in the few-annotation learning setup using a student-teacher architecture, which avoids relying on a sensitive post-processing of the pseudo-labels generated by the teacher model. We evaluate our method on the semi-supervised object detection benchmarks COCO and Pascal VOC, and it outperforms previous methods, especially when annotations are scarce. We believe that our contributions open new possibilities to adapt similar object detection methods in this setup as well."}

To overcome this issue, single-temporal supervision which treats change labels as the difference of two semantic masks has been proposed. This novel method trains a change detector using two spatially unrelated images with corresponding semantic labels. However, training with unpaired dataset shows not enough performance compared with other methods based on bi-temporal supervision. We suspect this phenomenon caused by ignorance of meaningful information in the actual bi-temporal pairs.In this paper, we emphasize that the change originates from the source image and show that manipulating the source image as an after-image is crucial to the performance of change detection.

However, ECG is infeasible for continuous cardiac monitoring due to its requirement for user participation. By contrast, photoplethysmography (PPG) provides easy-to-collect data, but its limited accuracy constrains its clinical usage. To combine the advantages of both signals, recent studies incorporate various deep learning techniques for the reconstruction of PPG signals to ECG; however, the lack of contextual information as well as the limited abilities to denoise biomedical signals ultimately constrain model performance. In this research, we propose Performer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that reconstructs ECG from PPG and combines the PPG and reconstructed ECG as multiple modalities for CVD detection. This method is the first time that Transformer sequence-to-sequence translation has been performed on biomedical waveform reconstruction, combining the advantages of both PPG and ECG. We also create Shifted Patch-based Attention (SPA), an effective method to encode/decode the biomedical waveforms. Through fetching the various sequence lengths and capturing cross-patch connections, SPA maximizes the signal processing for both local features and global contextual representations. The proposed architecture generates a state-of-the-art performance of 0.29 RMSE for the reconstruction of PPG to ECG on the BIDMC database, surpassing prior studies. We also evaluated this model on the MIMIC-III dataset, achieving a 95.9% accuracy in CVD detection, and on the PPG-BP dataset, achieving 75.9% accuracy in related CVD diabetes detection, indicating its generalizability. As a proof of concept, an earring wearable named PEARL (prototype), was designed to scale up the point-of-care (POC) healthcare system."}

In particular, StyleGAN2 has enabled various image generation and manipulation tasks due to its rich and disentangled latent spaces. However, the discovery of such directions is typically made either in a supervised manner, which requires annotated data for each desired manipulation, or in an unsupervised manner, which requires a manual effort to identify the directions. As a result, existing work typically finds only a handful of directions in which controllable edits can be made. In this study, we design a novel submodular framework that finds the most representative and diverse subset of directions in the latent space of StyleGAN2. Our approach takes advantage of the latent space of channel-wise style parameters, so-called stylespace, in which we cluster channels that perform similar manipulations into groups. Our framework promotes diversity by using the notion of clusters and can be efficiently solved with a greedy optimization scheme. We evaluate our framework with qualitative and quantitative experiments and show that our method finds more diverse and disentangled directions."}

Inspired by the compositional representation of objects in humans, we train a neural network architecture that explicitly represents objects as a dictionary of shared components and their spatial composition. In particular, during meta-learning, we train a knowledge base that consists of a dictionary of component representations and a dictionary of component activation maps that encode common spatial activation patterns of components. The elements of both dictionaries are shared among the training classes. During meta-testing, the representation of unseen classes is learned using the component representations and the component activation maps from the knowledge base. Finally, an attention mechanism is used to strengthen those components that are most important for each category. We demonstrate the value of our compositional learning framework for a few-shot classification using miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and FC100, where we achieve comparable performance."}

SRMs that predict residuals remedy this up to a degree, but fall short of providing an accurate and flexible solution. In this paper, we rethink residual predictions and propose Learnable Residual Attention (LRA) and Learnable Dense Reconstruction Attention (LDRA) modules, which operate over the input and the output of SRMs. These modules guide an SRM to concentrate on shadow region reconstruction, and limit reconstruction of non-shadow regions. The modules improve shadow removal (up to 20%) and detection accuracy across various backbones, and even improve the accuracy of other removal methods (up to 10%). In addition, the modules have minimal overhead (+<1MB memory) and are implemented in a few lines of code. Furthermore, to combat the challenge of training SRMs with small datasets, we present a synthetic dataset generation pipeline. Using our pipeline, we create a dataset called PITSA, which has 10 times more unique shadow-free images than the largest benchmark dataset. Pre-training models on the PITSA significantly improves shadow removal (+2 MAE on shadow regions) and detection accuracy of multiple methods. Our results show that LRA&LDRA, when plugged into a lightweight architecture pre-trained on the PITSA, outperform state-of-the-art shadow removal (+0.7 all-region MAE) and detection (+0.1 BER) methods on the benchmark ISTD and SRD datasets, despite running faster (+5%) and consuming less memory (x150)."}

This paper introduces an efficient TransVLAD module, which aggregates attention-based feature maps into a discriminative and compact global descriptor. Unlike existing methods that generate feature maps using only convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we propose a sparse transformer to encode global dependencies and compute attention-based feature maps, which effectively reduces visual ambiguities that occurs in large-scale geo-localization problems. A positional embedding mechanism is used to learn the corresponding geometric configurations between query and gallery images. A grouped VLAD layer is also introduced to reduce the number of parameters, and thus construct an efficient module. Finally, rather than only learning from the global descriptors on entire images, we propose a self-supervised learning method to further encode more information from multi-scale patches between the query and positive gallery images. Extensive experiments on three challenging large-scale datasets indicate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models, and has lower computational complexity."}

In this paper, we introduce a side information learning algorithm for generalized open set recognition based on the hyperbolic space to alleviate the distortion and accurately identify the unknown samples. Specifically, we propose a hyperbolic side information learning framework to identify the unseen samples and an ancestor search algorithm to search the most similar ancestor from the taxonomy of selected known classes.

Estimating the global motion between successive frames, in a manner not influenced by moving objects, is central to many video stabilization techniques, but poses significant challenges. A large body of work uses 2D affine transformations or homography for the global motion. However, in this work, we introduce a more general representation scheme, which adapts any existing optical flow network to ignore the moving objects and obtain a spatially smooth approximation of the global motion between video frames. We achieve this by a knowledge distillation approach, where we first introduce a low pass filter module into the optical flow network to constrain the predicted optical flow to be spatially smooth. This becomes our student network, named as GLOBALFLOWNET. Then, using the original optical flow network as the teacher network, we train the student network using a robust loss function. Given a trained GLOBALFLOWNET, we stabilize videos using a two stage process. In the first stage, we correct the instability in affine parameters using a quadratic programming approach constrained by a user-specified cropping limit to control loss of field of view. In the second stage, we stabilize the video further by smoothing global motion parameters, expressed using small number of discrete cosine transform coefficients. In extensive experiments on a variety of different videos, our technique outperforms state of the art techniques in terms of subjective quality and different quantitative measures of video stability. Additionally, we present a new measure for evaluation of video stabilization based on the flow generated by GLOBALFLOWNET and argue that it is based on a more general motion model in contrast to the affine motion model on which most existing measures are based.

We mix the local region of the target sample that corresponds to the most confident pseudo detections with a source image, and apply an additional consistency loss term to gradually adapt towards the target data distribution. In order to robustly define a confidence score for a region, we exploit the confidence score per pseudo detection that accounts for both the detector-dependent confidence and the bounding box uncertainty. Moreover, we propose a novel pseudo labelling scheme that progressively filters the pseudo target detections using the confidence metric that varies from a loose to strict manner along the training.

One of the main limitations of NeRFs is their slow rendering speed, both at training and inference time. Recent research addressing this issue focuses on optimisation of an explicit voxel grid (EVG) that represents the scene, which can be paired with neural networks to learn radiance fields. This approach significantly enhances the speed both at train and inference time, but at the cost of large memory occupation. In this work we propose Re:NeRF, an approach specifically designed for targeting EVG-NeRFs compressibility, which aims to reduce memory storage of NeRF models while maintaining comparable performance. We benchmark our approach with three different EVG-NeRF architectures on three popular benchmarks, showing Re:NeRF's broad usability and effectiveness."}

A common strategy for solving this problem is to apply simulation-to-reality (sim2real) approaches with the help of simulated scenes. While the majority of current robotics vision sim2real work focuses on image data, we present an industrial application case that uses sim2real transfer learning for point cloud data. We provide insights on how to generate and process synthetic point cloud data in order to achieve better performance when the learned model is transferred to real-world data. The issue of imbalanced learning is investigated using multiple strategies. A novel patch-based attention network is proposed additionally to tackle this problem."}

However, in reality, tourists visit various places worldwide and document their trips primarily through photos. These images contain a wealth of raw information that can be used to capture users' preferences and recommend personalized content. Visual content was already used in past works, but no large-scale publicly-available dataset that gives access to users' personal images exists for recommender systems. As such a resource would open-up possibilities for new image-based recommendation algorithms, we introduce Vis2Rec, a new dataset based on visit data extracted from users' Flickr photographic streams, which includes over 7 million photos, 36k recognizable points of interest, and 14k user profiles. Google Landmarks v2 is used as an auxiliary dataset to identify points of interest in users' photos, using a state-of-the-art image-matching deep architecture. Image-based user profiles are then constituted by aggregating the points of interest detected for each user. In addition, ground truth visits were determined for the test subset in order to enable accurate evaluation. Finally, we benchmark Vis2Rec using various existing recommender systems, and discuss the possibilities opened up by the availability of user images, as well as the societal issues that come with them. Following good practice in dataset sharing, Vis2Rec is created using only freely distributable content, and additional anonymization is performed to ensure the privacy of users. The raw dataset and the preprocessed user profiles will be publicly available at https://github.com/MSoumm/Vis2Rec."}

However, in contrast to conventional shape representations such as polygon meshes, the implicit representations cannot be easily edited and existing works that attempt to address this problem are extremely limited. In this work, we propose the first method for efficient interactive editing of signed distance functions expressed through neural networks, allowing free-form editing. Inspired by 3D sculpting software for meshes, we use a brush-based framework that is intuitive and can in the future be used by sculptors and digital artists. In order to localize the desired surface deformations, we regulate the network by using a copy of it to sample the previously expressed surface. We introduce a novel framework for simulating sculpting-style surface edits, in conjunction with interactive surface sampling and efficient adaptation of network weights. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate our method in various different 3D objects and under many different edits. The reported results clearly show that our method yields high accuracy, in terms of achieving the desired edits, while in the same time preserving the geometry outside the interaction areas."}

We claim that the performance of inpainting algorithms can be better judged by the generated structures and textures. Structures refer to the generated object boundary or novel geometric structures within the hole, while texture refers to high-frequency details, especially man-made repeating patterns filled inside the structural regions. We believe that better structures are usually obtained from a coarse-to-fine GAN-based generator network while repeating patterns nowadays can be better modeled using state-of-the-art high-frequency fast fourier convolutional layers. In this paper, we propose a novel inpainting network combining the advantages of the two designs. Therefore, our model achieves a remarkable visual quality to match state-of-the-art performance in both structure generation and repeating texture synthesis using a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, and our conclusions further highlight the two critical factors of image inpainting quality, structures, and textures, as the future design directions of inpainting networks."}

In open set problems, test samples may be drawn from either known or unknown classes. Existing open set action recognition methods are typically based on extending closed set methods by adding post hoc analysis of classification scores or feature distances and do not capture the relations among all the video clip elements. Our approach uses the reconstruction error to determine the novelty of the video since unknown classes are harder to put back together and thus have a higher reconstruction error than videos from known classes. We refer to our solution to the open set action recognition problem as \"Humpty Dumpty\", due to its reconstruction abilities. Humpty Dumpty is a novel graph-based autoencoder that accounts for contextual and semantic relations among the clip pieces for improved reconstruction. A larger reconstruction error leads to an increased likelihood that the action can not be reconstructed, i.e., can not put Humpty Dumpty back together again, indicating that the action has never been seen before and is novel/unknown. Extensive experiments are performed on two publicly available action recognition datasets including HMDB-51 and UCF-101, showing the state-of-the-art performance for open set action recognition."}

For both, the convolutional as well as the recent attention-based models, encoder-decoder-based architectures have been found to be useful due to the simultaneous requirement of global context and pixel-level resolution. Typically, a skip connection module is used to fuse the encoder and decoder features, which comprises of feature map concatenation followed by a convolution operation. Inspired by the demonstrated benefits of attention in a multitude of computer vision problems, we propose an attention-based fusion of encoder and decoder features. We pose MDE as a pixel query refinement problem, where coarsest-level encoder features are used to initialize pixel-level queries, which are then refined to higher resolutions by the proposed Skip Attention Module (SAM). We formulate the prediction problem as ordinal regression over the bin centers that discretize the continuous depth range and introduce a Bin Center Predictor (BCP) module that predicts bins at the coarsest level using pixel queries. Apart from the benefit of image adaptive depth binning, the proposed design helps learn improved depth embedding in initial pixel queries via direct supervision from the ground truth. Extensive experiments on the two canonical datasets, NYUV2 and KITTI, show that our architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art by 5.3% and 3.9%, respectively, along with an improved generalization performance by 9.4% on the SUNRGBD dataset."}

Despite of the progress, due to the limited fields of view of regular images, reconstructing large indoor environments still requires collecting many images with sufficient visual overlap, which is quite labor-intensive. 360deg images cover a much larger field of view than regular images and would facilitate the capture process. In this paper, we present 360MVSNet, the first deep learning network for multi-view stereo with 360deg images. Our method combines uncertainty estimation with a spherical sweeping module for 360deg images captured from multiple viewpoints in order to construct multi-scale cost volumes. By regressing volumes in a coarse-to-fine manner, high-resolution depth maps can be obtained. Furthermore, we have constructed EQMVS, a large-scale synthetic dataset that consists of over 50K pairs of RGB and depth maps in equirectangular projection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reconstruct large synthetic and real-world indoor scenes with significantly better completeness than previous traditional and learning-based methods while saving both time and effort in the data acquisition process."}

As new policies around digital identities are formed, we introduce three face access models in a hypothetical social network, where the user has the power to only appear in photos they approve. Our approach eclipses current tagging systems and replaces unapproved faces with quantitatively dissimilar deepfakes. In addition, we propose new metrics specific for this task, where the deepfake is generated at random with a guaranteed dissimilarity. We explain access models based on strictness of the data flow, and discuss impact of each model on privacy, usability, and performance. We evaluate our system on Facial Descriptor Dataset as the real dataset, and two synthetic datasets with random and equal class distributions. Running seven SOTA face recognizers on our results, MFMC reduces the average accuracy by 61%.

Weighted loss is one of the most popular ways of mitigating this issue, and a recent work has suggested that class-difficulty might be a better clue than conventionally used class-frequency to decide the distribution of weights. A heuristic formulation was used in the previous work for quantifying the difficulty, but we empirically find that the optimal formulation varies depending on the characteristics of datasets. Therefore, we propose Difficulty-Net, which learns to predict the difficulty of classes using the model's performance in a meta-learning framework. To make it learn reasonable difficulty of a class within the context of other classes, we newly introduce two key concepts, namely the relative difficulty and the driver loss. The former helps Difficulty-Net take other classes into account when calculating difficulty of a class, while the latter is indispensable for guiding the learning to a meaningful direction. Extensive experiments on popular long-tailed datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-tailed datasets.

Our method, FLAVR, is designed to reason about non-linear motion trajectories and complex occlusions implicitly from unlabeled videos and greatly simplifies the process of training, testing and deploying frame interpolation models. Furthermore, FLAVR delivers up to 6x speed up compared to the current state-of-the-art methods for multi-frame interpolation while consistently demonstrating superior qualitative and quantitative results compared with prior methods on popular benchmarks including Vimeo-90K, Adobe-240FPS, and GoPro.

The LiDAR local and global features are encoded using sparse convolution and multi-scale deformable attention respectively. In the decoder head, firstly, in the novel Li3DeTr cross-attention block, we link the LiDAR global features to 3D predictions leveraging the sparse set of object queries learnt from the data. Secondly, the object query interactions are formulated using multi-head self-attention. Finally, the decoder layer is repeated Ldec number of times to refine the object queries. Inspired by DETR, we employ set-to-set loss to train the Li3DeTr network. Without bells and whistles, the Li3DeTr network achieves 61.3% mAP and 67.6% NDS surpassing the state-of-the-art methods with non-maximum suppression (NMS) on the nuScenes dataset and it also achieves competitive performance on the KITTI dataset.

Further, the task assumes that the source data is not available for adaptation, due to privacy concerns or otherwise. We postulate that such systems need to jointly optimize the dual task of (i) selecting fixed number of samples from the target domain for annotation and (ii) transfer of knowledge from the pre-trained network to the target domain. To do this, SALAD consists of a novel Guided Attention Transfer Network (GATN) and an active learning function, HAL. The GATN enables feature distillation from pre-trained network to the target network, complemented with the target samples mined by HAL using transfer-ability and uncertainty criteria. SALAD has three key benefits: (i) it is task-agnostic, and can be applied across various visual tasks such as classification, segmentation and detection; (ii) it can handle shifts in output label space from the pre-trained source network to the target domain; (iii) it does not require access to source data for adaptation. We conduct extensive experiments across 3 visual tasks, viz. digits classification (MNIST, SVHN, VISDA), synthetic (GTA5) to real (CityScapes) image segmentation, and document layout detection (PubLayNet to DSSE). We show that our source-free approach, SALAD, results in an improvement of 0.5%-31.3% (across datasets and tasks) over prior adaptation methods that assume access to large amounts of annotated source data for adaptation."}

A limitation of GBML is its inability to adapt to real-world applications where input tasks are sampled from multiple distributions. An existing effort learns N initializations for tasks sampled from N distributions; roughly increasing training time by a factor of N. Instead, we use a single model initialization to learn distribution-specific parameters for every input task. This reduces negative knowledge transfer across distributions and overall computational cost. Specifically, we explore two ways of efficiently learning on multi-distribution tasks: 1) Binary Mask Perceptron (BMP), which learns distribution-specific layers, 2) Multi-modal Supermask (MMSUP), which learns distribution-specific parameters. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework (GEMS) on few-shot vision classification tasks. The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy and reduction in training time over existing state of the art algorithms on quasi-benchmark tasks."}

Therefore, adapting knowledge from a labelled daytime domain to an unlabelled nighttime domain has been widely researched. In addition to labelled daytime datasets, existing nighttime datasets usually provide nighttime images with corresponding daytime reference images captured at nearby locations for reference. The key challenge is to minimize the performance gap between the two domains. In this paper, we propose LoopDA for domain adaptive nighttime semantic segmentation. It consists of self-loops that result in reconstructing the input data using predicted semantic maps, by rendering them into the encoded features. In a warm-up training stage, the self-loops comprise of an inner-loop and an outer-loop, which are responsible for intra-domain refinement and inter-domain alignment, respectively. To reduce the impact of day-night pose shifts, in the later self-training stage, we propose a co-teaching pipeline that involves an offline pseudo-supervision signal and an online reference-guided signal 'DNA' (Day-Night Agreement), bringing substantial benefits to enhance nighttime segmentation. Our model outperforms prior methods on Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets for semantic segmentation. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/fy-vision/LoopDA."}

The multiple cameras with different focal lengths in mobile devices aid recent works in RefVSR, which aim to super-resolve a low-resolution ultra-wide video by utilizing wide-angle videos. Previous works in RefVSR used all reference frames of a Ref video at each time step for the super-resolution of low-resolution videos. However, computation on higher-resolution images increases the runtime and memory consumption, hence hinders the practical application of RefVSR. To solve this problem, we propose an Efficient Reference-based Video Super-Resolution (ERVSR) that exploits a single reference frame to super-resolve whole low-resolution video frames. We introduce an attention-based feature align module and an aggregation upsampling module that attends LR features using the correlation between the reference and LR frames. The proposed ERVSR achieves 12xfaster speed, 1/4 memory consumption than previous state-of-the-art RefVSR networks, and competitive performance on the RealMCVSR dataset while using a single reference image."}

However, such advancements often come at the cost of an increase of model memory and computational requirements. This represents a significant limitation for the deployability of research output in realistic settings, where the cost, the energy consumption, and the complexity of the framework play a crucial role. To solve this issue, the designer should search for models that maximise the performance while limiting its footprint. Typical approaches to reach this goal rely either on manual procedures, which cannot guarantee the optimality of the final design, or upon Neural Architecture Search algorithms to automatise the process, at the expenses of extremely high computational time. This paper provides a solution for the fast identification of a neural network that maximises the model accuracy while preserving size and computational constraints typical of tiny devices. Our approach, named FreeREA, is a custom cell-based evolution NAS algorithm that exploits an optimised combination of training-free metrics to rank architectures during the search, thus without need of model training. Our experiments, carried out on the common benchmarks NAS-Bench-101 and NATS-Bench, demonstrate that i) FreeREA is a fast, efficient and effective search method for models automatic design; ii) it outperforms State of the Art training-based and training-free techniques in all the datasets and benchmarks considered, and iii) it can easily generalise to constrained scenarios, representing a competitive solution for fast Neural Architecture Search in generic constrained applications.

Such falsifications range from cheapfakes (e.g., lookalikes or audio dubbing) to deepfakes (e.g., sophisticated AI media synthesis methods), which are becoming perceptually indistinguishable from real videos. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-modal semantic forensic approach to discover clues that go beyond detecting discrepancies in visual quality, thereby handling both simpler cheapfakes and visually persuasive deepfakes. In this work, our goal is to verify that the purported person seen in the video is indeed themselves by detecting anomalous facial movements corresponding to the spoken words. We leverage the idea of attribution to learn person-specific biometric patterns that distinguish a given speaker from others. We use interpretable Action Units (AUs) to capture a persons' face and head movement as opposed to deep CNN features, and we are the first to use word-conditioned facial motion analysis. We further demonstrate our method's effectiveness on a range of fakes not seen in training including those without video manipulation, that were not addressed in prior work."}

Moreover, our metric emphasizes facial primary regions considering that even minor changes to the eyes, nose, and mouth significantly affect human cognition. Our face-oriented metric consistently surpasses existing general or facial image quality assessment metrics by impressive margins.

One early breakthrough was CycleGAN that emphasizes one-to-one mappings between two unpaired image domains via generative-adversarial networks (GAN) coupled with the cycle-consistency constraint, while more recent works promote one-to-many mapping to boost diversity of the translated images. Motivated by scientific simulation and one-to-one needs, this work revisits the classic CycleGAN framework and boosts its performance to outperform more contemporary models without relaxing the cycle-consistency constraint. To achieve this, we equip the generator with a Vision Transformer (ViT) and employ necessary training and regularization techniques. Compared to previous best-performing models, our model performs better and retains a strong correlation between the original and translated image. An accompanying ablation study shows that both the gradient penalty and self-supervised pre-training are crucial to the improvement.

Most existing approaches rely on cameras only to perform segmentation in BEV space, which is fundamentally constrained by the absence of reliable depth information. Latest works leverage both camera and LiDAR modalities, but sub-optimally fuse their features using simple, concatenation-based mechanisms. In this paper, we address these problems by enhancing the alignment of the unimodal features in order to aid feature fusion, as well as enhancing the alignment between the cameras' perspective view (PV) and BEV representations. We propose X-Align, a novel end-to-end cross-modal and cross-view learning framework for BEV segmentation consisting of the following components: (i) a novel Cross-Modal Feature Alignment (X-FA) loss, (ii) an attention-based Cross-Modal Feature Fusion (X-FF) module to align multi-modal BEV features implicitly, and (iii) an auxiliary PV segmentation branch with Cross-View Segmentation Alignment (X-SA) losses to improve the PV-to-BEV transformation. We evaluate our proposed method across two commonly used benchmark datasets, i.e., nuScenes and KITTI-360.

Alternatively, one can use the non-contact HR estimation technique, remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), wherein HR is estimated from the facial videos of a person. Unfortunately, the existing rPPG methods perform poorly in the presence of facial deformations. Recently, there has been a proliferation of deep learning networks for rPPG. However, these networks require large-scale labelled data for better generalization. To alleviate these shortcomings, we propose a method ALPINE, that is, A noveL rPPG technique for Improving the remote heart rate estimatioN using contrastive lEarning. ALPINE utilizes the contrastive learning framework during training to address the issue of limited labelled data and introduces diversity in the data samples for better network generalization. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid loss comprising contrastive loss, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss and data fidelity loss. Our novel contrastive loss maximizes the similarity between the rPPG information from different facial regions, thereby minimizing the effect of local noise. The SNR loss improves the quality of temporal signals, and the data fidelity loss ensures that the correct rPPG signal is extracted. Our extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method, ALPINE outperforms the previous well-known rPPG methods."}

Thanks to the availability of smartphones with cameras and easy-to-use editing software, images can be remixed (i.e., redacted, edited, and recombined with other content) on-the-fly and with a worldwide audience that can repeat the process. From digital art to memes, the evolution of images through time is now an important topic of study for digital humanists, social scientists, and media forensics specialists. However, because typical data sets in computer vision are composed of static content, the development of automated algorithms to analyze remixed content has been limited. In this paper, we introduce the idea of Motif Mining -- the process of finding and summarizing remixed image content in large collections of unlabeled and unsorted data. In this paper, this idea is formalized and a reference implementation is introduced. Experiments are conducted on three meme-style data sets, including a newly collected set associated with the information war in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. The proposed motif mining approach is able to identify related remixed content that, when compared to similar approaches, more closely aligns with the preferences and expectations of human observers."}

In this paper, we first discuss why vision transformers are better suited than CNNs for such an agent. Next, we propose a simple transformer based active visual sampling model, called \"SimGlim\", which utilises transformer's inherent self-attention architecture to sequentially predict the best next location based on the current observable environment. We show the efficacy of our proposed method on the task of image reconstruction in the partial observable setting and compare our model against existing state-of-the-art active visual reconstruction methods. Finally, we provide ablations for the parameters of our design choice to understand their importance in the overall architecture."}

We present a framework, OutfitTransformer, that uses the proposed task-specific tokens and leverages the self-attention mechanism to learn effective outfit-level representations encoding the compatibility relations between all items in the entire outfit for addressing both compatibility prediction and complementary item retrieval. For compatibility prediction, we design an outfit token to capture a global outfit representation and train the framework using a classification loss. For complementary item retrieval, we design a target item token that additionally takes the target item specification (in the form of a category or text description) into consideration. We train our framework using a proposed set-wise outfit ranking loss to generate a target item embedding given an outfit, and a target item specification as inputs. The generated target item embedding is then used to retrieve compatible items that match the rest of the outfit. Additionally, we adopt a pre-training approach and a curriculum learning strategy to improve retrieval performance. Experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on compatibility prediction, fill-in-the-blank, and complementary item retrieval tasks."}

Recently, large gains were made on this task for the domain of natural images using self-supervised contrastive feature learning as a first step followed by kNN or traditional one-class classifiers for feature scoring. Learned representations that are non-uniformly distributed on the unit hypersphere have been shown to be beneficial for this task. We go a step further and investigate how the ph  geometrical compactness  of the ID feature distribution makes isolating and detecting outliers easier, especially in the realistic situation when ID training data is polluted with OOD data. We propose novel architectural modifications to the self-supervised feature learning step, that enable such compact distributions for ID data to be learned. We show that the proposed modifications can be effectively applied to most existing self-supervised objectives, with large gains in performance. Furthermore, this improved OOD performance is obtained without resorting to tricks such as using strongly augmented ID images (e.g. by 90 degree rotations) as proxies for the unseen OOD data, as these impose overly prescriptive assumptions about ID data and its invariances. We perform extensive studies on benchmark datasets for one-class OOD detection and show state-of-the-art performance in the presence of pollution in the ID data, and comparable performance otherwise. We also propose and extensively evaluate a novel feature scoring technique based on the angular Mahalanobis distance, and propose a simple and novel technique for feature ensembling during evaluation that enables a big boost in performance at nearly zero run-time cost compared to the standard use of model ensembling or test time augmentations.

Using the information, the LF de-occlusion (LF-DeOcc) task aims to reconstruct the occlusion-free center view image. Existing LF-DeOcc studies mainly focus on the sparsely sampled (sparse) LF images where most of the occluded regions are visible in other views due to the large disparity. In this paper, we expand LF-DeOcc in more challenging datasets, densely sampled (dense) LF images, which are taken by a micro-lens-based portable LF camera. Due to the small disparity ranges of dense LF images, most of the background regions are invisible in any view. To apply LF-DeOcc in both LF datasets, we propose a framework, ISTY, which is defined and divided into three roles: (1) extract LF features, (2) define the occlusion, and (3) inpaint occluded regions. By dividing the framework into three specialized components according to the roles, the development and analysis can be easier. Furthermore, an explainable intermediate representation, an occlusion mask, can be obtained in the proposed framework. The occlusion mask is useful for comprehensive analysis of the model and other applications by manipulating the mask. In experiments, qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art LF-DeOcc methods in both sparse and dense LF datasets."}

We propose MONOMER to solve this as a one-shot snippet detection task. MONOMER fuses context from visual, textual, and spatial modalities of snippets and documents to find query snippet in target documents. We conduct extensive ablations and experiments showing MONOMER outperforms several baselines from one-shot object detection (BHRL), template matching, and document understanding (LayoutLMv3).

The proposed method learns to adapt for each few-shot classification task a feature space with simultaneous inter-class orthogonality and intra-class low-rankness. Specifically, a deep feature extractor is trained by explicitly imposing orthogonal low-rank subspace structures among features corresponding to different classes within a given task. To adapt to novel tasks with unseen categories, we further meta-learn a light-weight transformation to enhance the inter-class margins. As an additional benefit, this light-weight transformation lets us exploit the query data for label propagation from labeled to unlabeled data without any auxiliary network components. The explicitly geometry-regularized feature subspaces allow the classifiers on novel tasks to be inferred in a closed form, with an adaptive subspace truncation that selectively discards non-discriminative dimensions. We perform experiments on standard few-shot image classification tasks, and observe performance superior to state-of-the-art meta-learning methods."}

Automated segmentation of wound regions from patient images can aid clinicians in measuring and managing chronic wounds and monitoring the wound healing trajectory. While there exists a plethora of work on general medical image segmentation, there is hardly any work on wound image analysis and segmentation. Existing methods are limited to segmenting a smaller subset of ulcers, such as foot ulcers, with no special processing for wound images. In this paper, we build segmentation models for eight different types of wound images. Wound image analysis is a challenging problem due to the lack of availability of extensive data (labeled or unlabeled) and annotation challenges due to the shortage of well-trained wound care clinicians. To handle these challenges, we contribute WoundSeg, a large and diverse dataset of segmented wound images. Generic wound image segmentation is complex due to the heterogeneous appearance of wound area across images of similar wound types. We propose a novel image segmentation framework, WSNet, which leverages (a) wound-domain adaptive pretraining on a large unlabeled wound image collection and (b) a global-local architecture that utilizes full image and its patches to learn fine-grained details of heterogeneous wounds. On WoundSeg, we achieve a decent Dice score of 0.847. On existing AZH Woundcare and Medetec datasets, we establish a new state-of-the-art. Further, we show the impact of using segmentation for improving the accuracy of downstream tasks like wound area and volume prediction."}

The calibration module iteratively minimizes the segment reprojection error induced by the estimated camera parameters. Second, we propose a novel approach for 3D sports field registration from broadcast soccer images.

However, the performance of 3D object detectors can suffer in scenarios where extreme occlusion of objects is present, or the number of object classes is large. In this paper, we study the problem of inferring 3D counts from densely packed scenes with heterogeneous objects. This problem has applications to important tasks such as inventory management or automatic crop yield estimation. We propose a novel regression-based method, CountNet3D, that uses mature 2D object detectors for finegrained classification and localization, and a PointNet backbone for geometric embedding. The network processes fused data from images and point clouds for end-to-end learning of counts. We perform experiments on a novel synthetic dataset for inventory management in retail, which we construct and make publicly available to the community. Our results show that regression-based 3D counting methods systematically outperform detection-based methods, and reveal that directly learning from raw point clouds greatly assists count estimation under extreme occlusion. Finally, we study the effectiveness of CountNet3D on a large dataset of real-world scenes where extreme occlusion is present and achieve an error rate of 11.01%."}

This oftentimes leads to substandard object detection and localization at inference time. To tackle this issue, we propose D2DF2WOD, a Dual-Domain Fully-to-Weakly Supervised Object Detection framework that leverages synthetic data, annotated with precise object localization, to supplement a natural image target domain, where only image-level labels are available. In its warm-up domain adaptation stage, the model learns a fully-supervised object detector (FSOD) to improve the precision of the object proposals in the target domain, and at the same time learns target-domain-specific and detection-aware proposal features. In its main WSOD stage, a WSOD model is specifically tuned to the target domain. The feature extractor and the object proposal generator of the WSOD model are built upon the fine-tuned FSOD model. We test D2DF2WOD on five dual-domain image benchmarks. The results show that our method results in consistently improved object detection and localization compared with state-of-the-art methods."}

Compared to reference approaches that apply a gradient-based adjustment of the parameters, our model aims to switch the classification module parameters depending on the task's embedding. In practice, we utilize a hypernetwork, which takes the aggregated information from support data and returns the classifier's parameters handcrafted for the considered problem. Moreover, we introduce the kernel-based representation of the support examples delivered to hypernetwork to create the parameters of the classification module. Consequently, we rely on relations between embeddings of the support examples instead of direct feature values provided by the backbone models. Thanks to this approach, our model can adapt to highly different tasks."}

In cluttered and crowded environments, monocular multi-object tracking (MOT) systems often fail due to occlusions. Multiple highly overlapped cameras are capable of recovering partial 3D information. When used properly, 3D data can significantly alleviate the occlusion issue. However, training a multi-camera tracker demands a large-scale multi-camera tracking dataset with diverse camera settings and backgrounds. These requirements make the collection of multi-camera tracking dataset challenging and expensive. The cost of creating such a dataset has limited the availability and scale of datasets in this domain. Instead, we appeal to an auto-annotation system to reduce the cost. The system uses overlapped and calibrated depth and RGB cameras to build a 3D tracker and automatically generates the 3D tracking results. We then manually check and correct the 3D tracking results to ensure the label quality, which is much cheaper than solely manual annotation. Next, the 3D tracking results are projected to each calibrated RGB camera view to create 2D tracking results. In this way, we collect and annotate a large-scale densely labeled multi-camera tracking dataset from five different environments. We have conducted extensive experiments using two real-time multi-camera trackers and a person re-identification (ReID) model under different settings. This dataset provides a reliable benchmark for multi-camera, multi-object tracking systems in cluttered and crowded environments. We expect this benchmark to encourage more research attempts in this domain. Also, our results demonstrate that adapting the trackers and ReID models on this dataset significantly improves their performance. Our dataset will be publicly released upon the acceptance of this work."}

Recent advances in deep learning have resulted in addressing this problem by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) similar to other vision tasks. But these existing works are limited to low-resolution images. Furthermore, the existing methods rely on heavy network architectures which cannot be deployed on resource-constrained platforms like smartphones. In this paper, we propose SHARDS, a shadow removal method for high-resolution images. The proposed method solves shadow removal for high-resolution images in two stages using two lightweight networks: a Low-resolution Shadow Removal Network (LSRNet) followed by a Detail Refinement Network (DRNet). LSRNet operates at low-resolution and computes a low-resolution, shadow-free output. It achieves state-of-the-art results on standard datasets with 65x lesser network parameters than existing methods. This is followed by DRNet, which is tasked to refine the low-resolution output to a high-resolution output using the high-resolution input shadow image as guidance. We construct high-resolution shadow removal datasets and through our experiments, prove the effectiveness of our proposed method on them. It is then demonstrated that this method can be deployed on modern day smartphones and is the first of its kind solution that can efficiently (2.4secs) perform shadow removal for high-resolution images (12MP) in these devices. Like many existing approaches, our shadow removal network relies on a shadow region mask as input to the network. To complement the lightweight shadow removal network, we also propose a lightweight shadow detector in this paper."}

Text-to-image matching is the most common form of cross-modal retrieval where given a large database of images and a textual query, the task is to retrieve the most relevant set of images. Existing methods utilize dual encoders with an attention mechanism and a ranking loss for learning embeddings that can be used for retrieval based on cosine similarity. Despite the fact that existing methods attempt to perform semantic alignment across visual regions and textual words using tailored attention mechanisms, there is no explicit supervision from the training objective to enforce such alignment. To address this, we propose NAPReg, a novel regularization formulation that projects high-level semantic entities i.e Nouns into the embedding space as shared learnable proxies. We show that using such a formulation allows the attention mechanism to learn better word-region alignment while also utilizing region information from other samples to build a more generalized latent representation for semantic concepts. Experiments on three benchmark datasets i.e. MS-COCO, Flickr30k and Flickr8k demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in cross-modal metric learning for text-image and image-text retrieval tasks."}

They take the place of the actors in dangerous stunt scenes or scenes where the same actor plays multiple characters. The double's face is later replaced with the actor's face and expressions manually using expensive CGI technology, costing millions of dollars and taking months to complete. An automated, inexpensive, and fast way can be to use face-swapping techniques that aim to swap an identity from a source face video (or an image) to a target face video. However, such methods cannot preserve the source expressions of the actor important for the scene's context. To tackle this challenge, we introduce video-to-video (V2V) face-swapping, a novel task of face-swapping that can preserve (1) the identity and expressions of the source (actor) face video and (2) the background and pose of the target (double) video. We propose FaceOff, a V2V face-swapping system that operates by learning a robust blending operation to merge two face videos following the constraints above. It reduces the videos to a quantized latent space and then blends them in the reduced space. FaceOff is trained in a self-supervised manner and robustly tackles the non-trivial challenges of V2V face-swapping.

It is essential for point-interactive colorization methods to appropriately propagate user-provided colors (i.e., user hints) in the entire image to obtain a reasonably colorized image with minimal user effort. However, existing approaches often produce partially colorized results due to the inefficient design of stacking convolutional layers to propagate hints to distant relevant regions. To address this problem, we present iColoriT, a novel point-interactive colorization Vision Transformer capable of propagating user hints to relevant regions, leveraging the global receptive field of Transformers. The self-attention mechanism of Transformers enables iColoriT to selectively colorize relevant regions with only a few local hints. Our approach colorizes images in real-time by utilizing pixel shuffling, an efficient upsampling technique that replaces the decoder architecture. Also, in order to mitigate the artifacts caused by pixel shuffling with large upsampling ratios, we present the local stabilizing layer. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach highly outperforms existing methods for point-interactive colorization, producing accurately colorized images with a user's minimal effort.

This warm-start weight initialization provides a general solution applicable to several CISS methods. Furthermore, it accelerates learning of new classes while mitigating forgetting.

In this paper, we propose a novel attack that negatively affects the decision latency of an end-to-end object detection pipeline. We craft a universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) that targets a widely used technique integrated in many object detector pipelines - non-maximum suppression (NMS). Our experiments demonstrate the proposed UAP's ability to increase the processing time of individual frames by adding \"phantom\" objects that overload the NMS algorithm while preserving the detection of the original objects which allows the attack to go undetected for a longer period of time."}

The detector clearly exhibits this bias when employed on a target dataset, particularly towards object sizes. However, object sizes vary heavily between domains due to, for instance, different labeling policies or geographical locations. State-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation approaches outsource methods to overcome the object size bias. Mainstream size adaptation approaches exploit target domain statistics, contradicting the original unsupervised assumption. Our novel unsupervised anchor calibration method addresses this limitation. Given a model trained on the source data, we estimate the optimal target anchors in a completely unsupervised manner. The main idea stems from an intuitive observation: by varying the anchor sizes for the target domain, we inevitably introduce noise or even remove valuable object cues. The latent object representation, perturbed by the anchor size, is closest to the learned source features only under the optimal target anchors. We leverage this observation for anchor size optimization. Our experimental results show that, without any retraining, we achieve competitive results even compared to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised size adaptation approaches. In addition, our anchor calibration can be combined with such existing methods, making them completely unsupervised."}

Figures usually include text and discrete objects, e.g., boxes in a diagram, with lines and arrows that connect them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OCR-VQGAN by conducting several experiments on the task of figure reconstruction. Additionally, we explore the qualitative and quantitative impact of weighting different perceptual metrics in the overall loss function.

However, the developed deep reconstruction models are generally limited in generalization when applied to unseen testing samples in target domain. Furthermore, privacy concerns may impede the availability of source-domain training data to retrain or adapt the model to the target-domain testing data, which are quite common in real-world medical applications. To address these issues, we introduce a source-free black-box test-time adaptation method for sparse-view CT reconstruction with unknown noise levels based on prior-informed implicit neural representation learning (PINER). By leveraging implicit neural representation learning to generate the image representations at various noise levels, the proposed method is able to construct the adapted input representations at test time based on the inference of black-box model and output analysis. We performed experiments of source-free test-time adaptation for sparse-view CT reconstruction with unknown noise levels on multiple anatomical sites with different black-box deep reconstruction models, where our method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms."}

Existing works use this technique to provably secure a pretrained non-robust model by training a custom denoiser network on entire training data. However, access to the training set may be restricted to a handful of data samples due to constraints such as high transmission cost and the proprietary nature of the data. Thus, we formulate a novel problem of \"how to certify the robustness of pretrained models using only a few training samples\". We observe that training the custom denoiser directly using the existing techniques on limited samples yields poor certification. To overcome this, our proposed approach (DE-CROP) generates class-boundary and interpolated samples corresponding to each training sample, ensuring high diversity in the feature space of the pretrained classifier. We train the denoiser by maximizing the similarity between the denoised output of the generated sample and the original training sample in the classifier's logit space. We also perform distribution level matching using domain discriminator and maximum mean discrepancy that yields further benefit. In white box setup, we obtain significant improvements over the baseline on multiple benchmark datasets and also report similar performance under the challenging black box setup."}

Many recent works have mainly focused on under-exposure cases where images are often captured in low-light conditions (e.g. nighttime) and achieved promising results for enhancing the quality of images. However, they are inferior to handling images under over-exposure. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised enhancement framework which is robust against various lighting conditions while does not require any well-exposed images to serve as the ground-truths. Our main concept is to construct pseudo-ground-truth images synthesized from multiple source images that simulate all potential exposure scenarios to train the enhancement network. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts in several public datasets in terms of both quantitative metrics and qualitative results.

With this assumption, the long-standing principle behind flow estimation consists in optimizing a photometric loss that maximizes the similarity between paired pixels in successive frames. However, these frames could be subject to strong brightness changes due to the radiometric properties of scenes as well as their viewing conditions. In this paper, we present BrightFlow, a new method to train any optical flow estimation network in an unsupervised manner. It consists in training two networks that jointly estimate optical flow and brightness changes. These changes are then compensated in the photometric loss so that reconstruction errors due to shadows or reflections will not affect negatively the training. As this compensation mechanism is only used at training stage, our method does not impact the number of parameters or the complexity at inference. Extensive experiments conducted on standard datasets and optical flow architectures show a consistent gain of our method. Source code is available at https://github.com/CEA-LIST/BrightFlow."}

While processing this information might seem effortless for human brains, it is challenging to build a machine that can perform similar tasks since complex interactions cannot be dealt with a single type of integration but require more sophisticated approaches. In this paper, we propose a new simple method to address the multisensory integration in video understanding. Unlike previous works where a single fusion type is used, we design a multi-head model with individual event-specific layers to deal with different audio-visual relationships, enabling different ways of audio-visual fusion. Experimental results show that our event-specific layers can discover unique properties of the audio-visual relationships in the videos, e.g., semantically matched moments, and rhythmic events. Moreover, although our network is trained with single labels, our multi-head design can inherently output additional semantically meaningful multi-labels for a video. As an application, we demonstrate that our proposed method can expose the extent of event-characteristics of popular benchmark datasets."}

However, it is difficult to make unbiased empirical comparisons between competing deep learning models, making it unclear whether, and to what extent, transformer-based models are beneficial. In this paper we systematically compare the impact of adding transformer structures into state-of-the-art segmentation models for overhead imagery. Each model is given a similar budget of free parameters, and their hyperparameters are optimized using Bayesian Optimization with a fixed quantity of data and computation time. We conduct our experiments with a large and diverse dataset comprising two large public benchmarks: Inria and DeepGlobe. We perform additional ablation studies to explore the impact of specific transformer-based modeling choices. Our results suggest that transformers provide consistent, but modest, performance improvements. We only observe this advantage however in hybrid models that combine convolutional and transformer-based structures, while fully transformer-based models achieve relatively poor performance."}

To explore this task, we leverage the power of computer-generated imagery to create, in a semi-automatic fashion, high-quality synthetic images of the same bike before and after a damage occurs. The resulting dataset, Bent & Broken Bicycles (BBBicycles), contains 39,200 images and 2,800 unique bike instances spanning 20 different bike models.

To address this problem, recent studies adopt a weakly supervised learning approach under the sparse annotation. Different from the existing studies, this study aims to reduce the epistemic uncertainty measured by the entropy for a precise semantic segmentation. We propose the graphical information gain based attention network called GaIA, which alleviates the entropy of each point based on the reliable information. The graphical information gain discriminates the reliable point by employing relative entropy between target point and its neighborhoods. We further introduce anchor-based additive angular margin loss, ArcPoint. The ArcPoint optimizes the unlabeled points containing high entropy towards semantically similar classes of the labeled points on hypersphere space. Experimental results on S3DIS and ScanNet-v2 datasets demonstrate our framework outperforms the existing weakly supervised methods."}

However, the performance increase can not match the significantly expanded number of parameters, which is the main bottleneck in real-world applications. Contrastively, mask-based unstructured pruning obtains a lightweight network by removing redundancy in the heavy network. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Sparse Dynamic Convolution (SD-Conv), to naturally integrate these two paths such that it can inherit the advantage of dynamic mechanism and sparsity. We first design a binary mask derived from a learnable threshold to prune static kernels, significantly reducing the parameters and computational cost but achieving higher performance in Imagenet-1K. We further transfer pretrained models into a variety of downstream tasks, showing consistently better results than baselines. We hope our SD-Conv could be an efficient alternative to conventional dynamic convolutions."}

The greatest challenge is the exact estimation of various line shapes in the world, which highly depends on the chosen representation. While anchor-based and grid-based line representations have been proposed, all suffer from the same limitation, the necessity of discretizing the 3D space. To address this limitation, we present an anchor-free parametric lane representation, which defines traffic lines as continuous curves in 3D space. Choosing splines as our representation, we show their superiority over polynomials of different degrees that were proposed in previous 2D lane detection approaches. Our continuous representation allows us to model even complex lane shapes at any position in the 3D space, while implicitly enforcing smoothness constraints. Our model is validated on a synthetic 3D lane dataset including a variety of scenes in terms of complexity of road shape and illumination. We outperform the state-of-the-art in nearly all geometric performance metrics and achieve a great leap in the detection rate. In contrast to discrete representations, our parametric model requires no post-processing achieving highest processing speed. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis over different parametric representations for 3D lane detection.

In this paper, we propose two novel and efficient neural models for camera-based physiological measurement called EfficientPhys that remove the need for face detection, segmentation, normalization, color space transformation or any other preprocessing steps. Using an input of raw video frames, our models achieve strong accuracy on three public datasets. We show that this is the case whether using a transformer or convolutional backbone. We further evaluate the latency of the proposed networks and show that our most lightweight network also achieves a 33% improvement in efficiency."}

Decades-old photos often suffer from severe and commingled degradation such as cracks, defocus, and color-fading, which are difficult to treat individually and harder to repair when they interact. Deep learning presents a plausible avenue, but the lack of large-scale datasets of old photos makes addressing this restoration task very challenging. Here we present a novel reference-based end-to-end learning framework that is able to both repair and colorize old, degraded pictures. Our proposed framework consists of three modules: a restoration sub-network that conducts restoration from degradations, a similarity network that performs color histogram matching and color transfer, and a colorization subnet that learns to predict the chroma elements of images conditioned on chromatic reference signals. The overall system makes uses of color histogram priors from reference images, which greatly reduces the need for large-scale training data. We have also created a first-of-a-kind public dataset of real old photos that are paired with ground truth \"pristine\" photos that have been manually restored by PhotoShop experts. We conducted extensive experiments on this dataset and synthetic datasets, and found that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models using both qualitative comparisons and quantitative measurements.

Most of the existing SDG approaches aim at generating out-of-domain samples by either transforming the source images into different styles or optimizing adversarial noise perturbations. In this paper, we show that generating images with diverse styles can be complementary to creating hard samples when tackling the SDG task. This inspires us to propose our approach of Factorized Frequency Modification (FFM) which can fulfill the requirement of generating diverse and hard samples to tackle the problem of out-of-domain generalization. Specifically, we design a unified framework consisting of a style transformation module, an adversarial perturbation module, and a dynamic frequency selection module. We seamlessly equip the framework with iterative adversarial training which facilitates the task model to learn discriminative features from hard and diverse augmented samples. We perform extensive experiments on four image recognition benchmark datasets of Digits-DG, CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, and PACS, which demonstrates that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches."}

Patch attacks can be highly effective in a variety of tasks and physically realizable via attachment (e.g. a sticker) to the real-world objects. Despite the diversity in attack patterns, adversarial patches tend to be highly textured and different in appearance from natural images. We exploit this property and present PatchZero, a general defense pipeline against white-box adversarial patches without retraining the downstream classifier or detector. Specifically, our defense detects adversaries at the pixel-level and \"zeros out\" the patch region by repainting with mean pixel values. We further design a two-stage adversarial training scheme to defend against the stronger adaptive attacks. PatchZero achieves SOTA defense performance on the image classification (ImageNet, RESISC45), object detection (PASCAL VOC), and video classification (UCF101) tasks with little degradation in benign performance. In addition, PatchZero transfers to different patch shapes and attack types."}

However, very few works study the detection of incrementally appearing deepfakes in the real-world scenarios. To simulate the wild scenes, this paper suggests a continual deepfake detection benchmark (CDDB) over a new collection of deepfakes from both known and unknown generative models. The suggested CDDB designs multiple evaluations on the detection over easy, hard, and long sequence of deepfake tasks, with a set of appropriate measures. In addition, we exploit multiple approaches to adapt multiclass incremental learning methods, commonly used in the continual visual recognition, to the continual deepfake detection problem. We evaluate existing methods, including their adapted ones, on the proposed CDDB. Within the proposed benchmark, we explore some commonly known essentials of standard continual learning. Our study provides new insights on these essentials in the context of continual deepfake detection. The suggested CDDB is clearly more challenging than the existing benchmarks, which thus offers a suitable evaluation avenue to the future research.

However, current methods typically randomly sample video clips for learning, which results in an imperfect supervisory signal. In this work, we propose PreViTS, an SSL framework that utilizes an unsupervised tracking signal for selecting clips containing the same object, which helps better utilize temporal transformations of objects. PreViTS further uses the tracking signal to spatially constrain the frame regions to learn from and trains the model to locate meaningful objects by providing supervision on Grad-CAM attention maps. To evaluate our approach, we train a momentum contrastive (MoCo) encoder on VGG-Sound and Kinetics-400 datasets with PreViTS. Training with PreViTS outperforms representations learnt by contrastive strategy alone on video downstream tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on action classification. PreViTS helps learn feature representations that are more robust to changes in background and context, as seen by experiments on datasets with background changes. Learning from large-scale videos with PreViTS could lead to more accurate and robust visual feature representations."}

We then use our framework to analyze the effects of basic AL settings, such as the query-batch size and the use of subset selection, and different datasets on AL performance.

NeRF-based approaches are effective for novel view synthesis, however such models memorize the radiance for every point in a scene within a neural network. Since these models are scene-specific and lack a 3D scene representation, classical editing such as shape manipulation, or combining scenes is not possible. While there are some recent hybrid approaches that combine NeRF with external scene representations such as sparse voxels, planes, hash tables, etc., they focus mostly on efficiency and don't explore the scene editing and manipulation capabilities of hybrid approaches. With the aim of exploring controllable scene representations for novel view synthesis, our model couples learnt scene-specific 3D feature volumes with a general NeRF rendering network. We can generalize to novel scenes by optimizing only the scene-specific 3D feature volume, while keeping the parameters of the rendering network fixed. Since the feature volumes are independent of the rendering model, we can manipulate and combine scenes by editing their corresponding feature volumes. The edited volume can then be plugged into the rendering model to synthesise high-quality novel views. We demonstrate scene manipulations including: scene mixing; applying rigid and non-rigid transformations; inserting, moving and deleting objects in a scene; while producing photo-realistic novel-view synthesis results."}

Quantizing gradients is challenging because it requires higher granularity and their values span a wider range than the weight and feature maps. We propose an extension of the Channel-wise Block Floating Point format that allows for quick gradient computation, using a minimal amount of quantization time. This is achieved through sharing an exponent across both depth and batch dimensions in order to quantize tensors once and reuse them during backpropagation. We test our method using standard models such as AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet, on the CIFAR10, SVHN and ImageNet datasets.

A balance between stability and plasticity of the incremental process is needed in order to obtain good accuracy for past as well as new classes. Existing exemplar-free class-incremental methods focus either on successive fine tuning of the model, thus favoring plasticity, or on using a feature extractor fixed after the initial incremental state, thus favoring stability. We introduce a method which combines a fixed feature extractor and a pseudo-features generator to improve the stability-plasticity balance. The generator uses a simple yet effective geometric translation of new class features to create representations of past classes, made of pseudo-features. The translation of features only requires the storage of the centroid representations of past classes to produce their pseudo-features. Actual features of new classes and pseudo-features of past classes are fed into a linear classifier which is trained incrementally to discriminate between all classes. The incremental process is much faster with the proposed method compared to mainstream ones which update the entire deep model.

However, the high densities, tight contacts, and weak boundaries of the cells pose substantial technical challenges. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a new instance segmentation model, which we refer to as single-cell Transformer segmenter (SCTS). It utilizes a Swin Transformer as its backbone, combining the global modeling capabilities of a Transformer and the local modeling capabilities of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to ensure model adaptability to different cell sizes, shapes, and textures. It also embeds a three-class (background, cell interior, and cell boundary) semantic segmentation branch to classify pixels and to provide semantic features for downstream tasks. The prediction of boundary semantics improves boundary awareness, and the differentiation between foreground and background semantics improves segmentation integrity in regions with weak signals.

Methods based on 3D Morphable Models (3DMM), and their combination with differentiable renderers, have shown promising results. However, the expressiveness of 3DMMs is limited, and they typically yield over-smoothed and identity-agnostic 3D shapes limited to the face region. Highly accurate full head reconstructions have recently been obtained with neural fields that parameterize the geometry using multilayer perceptrons. The versatility of these representations has also proved effective for disentangling geometry, materials and lighting. However, these methods require several tens of input images. In this paper, we introduce SIRA, a method which, from a single image, reconstructs human head avatars with high fidelity geometry and factorized lights and surface materials. Our key ingredients are two data-driven statistical models based on neural fields that resolve the ambiguities of single-view 3D surface reconstruction and appearance factorization.

The transformer contracting path predicts per-image labels and is optimized by a classification head. The transformer expanding path models the temporal coherency between embryo images to ensure monotonic non-decreasing constraint and is optimized by a segmentation head. Both contracting and expanding paths are synergetically learned by a collaboration head. We have benchmarked our proposed EmbryosFormer on two datasets: a public dataset with mouse embryos with 8-cell stage and an in-house dataset with human embryos with 4-cell stage.

Vector quantization aims at reducing the model size by indexing model weights with full-precision embeddings, i.e., codewords, while the index needs to be restored to 32-bit during computation. Binary and other low-precision quantization methods can reduce the model size up to 32x, however, at the cost of a considerable accuracy drop. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for ternary quantization to produce smaller and more accurate compressed models. By integrating hyperspherical learning, pruning and reinitialization, our proposed Hyperspherical Quantization (HQ) method reduces the cosine distance between the full-precision and ternary weights, thus reducing the bias of the straight-through gradient estimator during ternary quantization. Compared with existing work at similar compression levels ( 30x,  40x), our method significantly improves the test accuracy and reduces the model size."}

However, current solutions are particurly computationally demanding, especially due to the wide usage of spatio-temporal 3D convolutions. We observe that, while different model architectures achieve similar performance on benchmarks, visual variations between predicted saliency maps are still significant. Inspired by this intuition, we propose a lightweight model that employs multiple simple heterogeneous decoders and adopts several practical approaches to improve accuracy while keeping computational costs low, such as hierarchical multi-map knowledge distillation, multi-output saliency prediction, unlabeled auxiliary datasets and channel reduction with teacher assistant supervision. Our approach achieves saliency prediction accuracy on par or better than state-of-the-art methods on DFH1K, UCF-Sports and Hollywood2 benchmarks, while enhancing significantly the efficiency of the model."}

We present a novel efficient action recognition algorithm, which allocates computational resources adaptively to individual frames depending on their relevance and significance. Specifically, our algorithm adopts LSTM-based policy modules and sequentially estimates the usefulness of each frame based on their intermediate representations. If a certain frame is unlikely to be helpful for recognizing actions, our model stops forwarding the features to the rest of the layers and starts to consider the next sampled frame. We further reduce the computational cost of our approach by introducing a simple yet effective early termination strategy during the inference procedure. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on three public benchmarks: ActivityNet-v1.3, Mini-Kinetics, and THUMOS'14. Our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves outstanding trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in action recognition."}

Other state-of-the-art works mainly focus on fully supervised learning approaches that rely heavily on human annotations. However, the scarcity of labeled and unlabeled data is a long-standing challenge in histopathology. Currently, representation learning without labels remains unexplored in the histopathology domain. The proposed method, Magnification Prior Contrastive Similarity (MPCS), enables self-supervised learning of representations without labels on small-scale breast cancer dataset BreakHis by exploiting magnification factor, inductive transfer, and reducing human prior. The proposed method matches fully supervised learning state-of-the-art performance in malignancy classification when only 20% of labels are used in fine-tuning and outperform previous works in fully supervised learning settings for three public breast cancer datasets, including BreakHis. Further, It provides initial support for a hypothesis that reducing human-prior leads to efficient representation learning in self-supervision, which will need further investigation. The implementation of this work is available online on GitHub."}

However, many real-life datasets are only partially labeled. We propose a semi-supervised machine learning training strategy to improve event detection performance on sequential data, such as video recordings, when only sparse labels are available, such as event start times without their corresponding end times. Our method uses noisy guesses of the events' end times to train event detection models. Depending on how conservative these guesses are, mislabeled samples may be introduced into the training set. We further propose a mathematical model for explaining and estimating the evolution of the classification performance for increasingly noisier end time estimates. We show that neural networks can improve their detection performance by leveraging more training data with less conservative approximations despite the higher proportion of incorrect labels. We adapt sequential versions of CIFAR-10 and MNIST, and use the Berkeley MHAD and HMBD51 video datasets to empirically evaluate our method, and find that our risk-tolerant strategy outperforms conservative estimates by 3.5 points of mean average precision for CIFAR, 30 points for MNIST, 3 points for MHAD, and 14 points for HMBD51. Then, we leverage the proposed training strategy to tackle a real-life application: processing continuous video recordings of epilepsy patients, and show that our method outperforms baseline labeling methods by 17 points of average precision, and reaches a classification performance similar to that of fully supervised models."}

The sketch-to-photo translation is a computer vision task that enables a machine to do this imagination, taking a binary sketch image and generating plausible RGB images corresponding to the sketch. Hence, deep neural networks for this task should learn to generate a wide range of frequencies because most parts of the input (binary sketch image) are composed of DC signals. In this paper, we propose a new loss function named Wavelet-domain High-Frequency Loss (WHFL) to overcome the limitations of previous methods that tend to have a bias toward low frequencies. The proposed method emphasizes the loss on the high frequencies by designing a new weight matrix imposing larger weights on the high bands. Unlike existing hand-craft methods that control frequency weights using binary masks, we use the matrix with finely controlled elements according to frequency scales. The WHFL is designed in a multi-scale form, which lets the loss function focus more on the high frequency according to decomposition levels. We use the WHFL as a complementary loss in addition to conventional ones defined in the spatial domain. Experiments show we can improve the qualitative and quantitative results in both spatial and frequency domains. Additionally, we attempt to verify the WHFL's high-frequency generation capability by defining a new evaluation metric named Unsigned Euclidean Distance Field Error (UEDFE)."}

However, this detection is challenging due to the visual similarity of melanocytes to other cells in routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images, leading to the failure of current nuclei detection methods. Stains such as Sox10 can mark melanocytes, but they require an additional step and expense and thus are not regularly used in clinical practice. To address these limitations, we introduce VSGD-Net, a novel detection network that learns melanocyte identification through virtual staining from H&E to Sox10. The method takes only routine H&E images during inference, resulting in a promising approach to support pathologists in the diagnosis of melanoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the detection problem using image synthesis features between two distinct pathology stainings. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art nuclei detection methods."}

Despite the success, their applicability can be further expanded by incorporating with various types of user-specified conditions such as text and images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the conditional generative neural radiance fields (CG-NeRF), which generates multi-view images that reflect multimodal input conditions such as images or text. However, generating 3D-aware images from multimodal conditions bears several challenges. First, each condition type has different amount of information - e.g., the amount of information in text and color images are significantly different. Furthermore, the pose-consistency is often violated when diversifying the generated images from input conditions. Addressing such challenges, we propose 1) a unified architecture that effectively handles multiple types of conditions, and 2) the pose-consistent diversity loss for generating various images while maintaining the view consistency. Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains consistent image quality on various multimodal condition types and achieves superior fidelity and diversity compared to the existing NeRF-based generative models."}

In this paper, we develop a computer vision based infant symmetry assessment system, leveraging 3D human pose estimation for infants. Evaluation and calibration of our system against ground truth assessments is complicated by our findings from a survey of human ratings of angle and symmetry, that such ratings exhibit low inter-rater reliability. To rectify this, we develop a Bayesian estimator of the ground truth derived from a probabilistic graphical model of fallible human raters. We show that the 3D infant pose estimation model can achieve 68% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve performance in predicting the Bayesian aggregate labels, compared to only 61% from a 2D infant pose estimation model and 60% from a 3D adult pose estimation model, highlighting the importance of 3D poses and infant domain knowledge in assessing infant body symmetry. Our survey analysis also suggests that human ratings are susceptible to higher levels of bias and inconsistency, and hence our final 3D pose-based symmetry assessment system is calibrated but not directly supervised by Bayesian aggregate human ratings, yielding higher levels of consistency and lower levels of inter-limb assessment bias."}

One challenge in this area is the biased distribution of predicates in the dataset and the semantic space. Recent works incorporating knowledge graphs with scene graphs prove effective in improving recall for the tail predicate classes. Moreover, many recent SGG approaches with promising results explicitly redistribute the predicates in both the training process and in the prediction step. To incorporate external knowledge, we construct a commonsense knowledge graph by integrating ConceptNet and Wikidata. To explicitly unbias SGG with knowledge in the reasoning process, we propose a novel framework, Explicit Ontological Adjustment (EOA), to adjust the graph model predictions with knowledge priors. We use the edge matrix from the commonsense knowledge graph as a module in the graph neural network model to refine the relationship detection process. This module proves effective in alleviating the long-tail distribution of predicates. When combined, we show that these modules achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Visual Genome dataset in most cases. The source code will be made publicly available."}

Most of the existing work has focused on developing data-driven discriminative models for scene understanding. This paper provides a new approach to scene understanding, from a synthesis model perspective, by leveraging the recent progress on implicit scene representation and neural rendering. Building upon the great success of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), we introduce Scene-Property Synthesis with NeRF (SS-NeRF) that is able to not only render photo-realistic RGB images from novel viewpoints, but also render various accurate scene properties (e.g., appearance, geometry, and semantics). By doing so, we facilitate addressing a variety of scene understanding tasks under a unified framework, including semantic segmentation, surface normal estimation, reshading, keypoint detection, and edge detection. Our SS-NeRF framework can be a powerful tool for bridging generative learning and discriminative learning, and thus be beneficial to the investigation of a wide range of interesting problems, such as studying task relationships within a synthesis paradigm, transferring knowledge to novel tasks, facilitating downstream discriminative tasks as ways of data augmentation, and serving as auto-labeller for data creation.

However, the transferability has not been understood in terms of to which class target model's predictions were misled (i.e., class-aware transferability). In this paper, we differentiate the cases in which a target model predicts the same wrong class as the source model (\"same mistake\") or a different wrong class (\"different mistake\") to analyze and provide an explanation of the mechanism. We find that (1) AEs tend to cause same mistakes, which correlates with \"non-targeted transferability\"; however, (2) different mistakes occur even between similar models, regardless of the perturbation size. Furthermore, we present evidence that the difference between same mistakes and different mistakes can be explained by non-robust features, predictive but human-uninterpretable patterns: different mistakes occur when non-robust features in AEs are used differently by models. Non-robust features can thus provide consistent explanations for the class-aware transferability of AEs."}

Recent methods have proposed to address this problem with test-time training (TTT), where a two-branch model is trained to learn a main classification task and also a self-supervised task used to perform test-time adaptation. However, these techniques require defining a proxy task specific to the target application. To tackle this limitation, we propose TTTFlow: a Y-shaped architecture using an unsupervised head based on Normalizing Flows to learn the normal distribution of latent features and detect domain shifts in test examples. At inference, keeping the unsupervised head fixed, we adapt the model to domain-shifted examples by maximizing the log likelihood of the Normalizing Flow. Our results show that our method can significantly improve the accuracy with respect to previous works."}

However, despite of using sophisticated rigidity assumptions and parametrizations, such networks are typically limited to only two frame pairs which does not allow them to exploit temporal information. In our paper we address this shortcoming by proposing a novel multi-frame approach that considers an additional preceding stereo pair. To this end, we proceed in two steps: Firstly, building upon the recent RAFT-3D approach, we develop an improved two-frame baseline by incorporating an advanced stereo method. Secondly, and even more importantly, exploiting the specific modeling concepts of RAFT-3D, we propose a U-Net architecture that performs a fusion of forward and backward flow estimates and hence allows to integrate temporal information on demand. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark do not only show that the advantages of the improved baseline and the temporal fusion approach complement each other, they also demonstrate that the computed scene flow is highly accurate. More precisely, our approach ranks second overall and first for the even more challenging foreground objects, in total outperforming the original RAFT-3D method by more than 16%.

However, these methods have the disadvantage of over-fitting and focusing on only a few specific forgery footprints. On the other hand, real-life manipulated images are generated via a wide variety of forgery operations and thus, leave behind a wide variety of forgery footprints. Therefore, we need a more general approach for image forgery localization that can work well on a variety of forgery conditions. A key assumption in underlying forged region localization is that there remains a difference of feature distribution between untampered and manipulated regions in each forged image sample, irrespective of the forgery type. In this paper, we aim to leverage this difference of feature distribution to aid in image forgery localization. Specifically, we use contrastive loss to learn mapping into a feature space where the features between untampered and manipulated regions are well-separated for each image. Also, our method has the advantage of localizing manipulated region without requiring any prior knowledge or assumption about the forgery type. We demonstrate that our work outperforms several existing methods on three benchmark image manipulation datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/niloy193/CFLNet."}

While the potentials of Convolutional Neural Networks for detection, classification and segmentation tasks have successfully been demonstrated in other application areas, this relatively new field currently lacks the required quantity and quality of training data for such a highly data-driven approach. Therefore, we propose a novel large-scale image dataset specializing in the fine-grained identification of 74 relevant crop and weed species with a strong emphasis on data variability. We provide annotations of labeled bounding boxes, semantic masks and stem positions for about 112k instances in more than 8k high-resolution images of both real-world agricultural sites and specifically cultivated outdoor plots of rare weed types. Additionally, each sample is enriched with an extensive set of meta-annotations regarding environmental conditions and recording parameters. We furthermore conduct benchmark experiments for multiple learning tasks on different variants of the dataset to demonstrate its versatility and provide examples of useful mapping schemes for tailoring the annotated data to the requirements of specific applications. In the course of the evaluation, we furthermore demonstrate how incorporating multiple species of weeds into the learning process increases the accuracy of crop detection. Overall, the evaluation clearly demonstrates that our dataset represents an essential step towards overcoming the data gap and promoting further research in the area of Precision Agriculture."}

In this work, we present a facial 3D Morphable Model, which exploits both of the above, and can accurately model a subject's identity, pose and expression and render it in arbitrary illumination. This is achieved by utilizing a powerful deep style-based generator to overcome two main weaknesses of neural radiance fields, their rigidity and rendering speed. We introduce a style-based generative network that synthesizes in one pass all and only the required rendering samples of a neural radiance field. We create a vast labelled synthetic dataset of facial renders, and train the network, so that it can accurately model and generalize on facial identity, pose and appearance. Finally, we show that this model can accurately be fit to \"in-the-wild\" facial images of arbitrary pose and illumination, extract the facial characteristics, and be used to re-render the face in controllable conditions."}

Although the existing weak supervision methods work well in manipulating the style codes along one attribute, the accuracy of manipulating multiple attributes is neglected. Multi-attribute representations are prone to entanglement in the StyleGAN latent space, while sequential editing leads to error accumulation. To address these limitations, we design a Dynamic Style Manipulation Network (DyStyle) whose structure and parameters vary by input samples, to perform nonlinear and adaptive manipulation of latent codes for flexible and precise attribute control. In order to efficient and stable optimization of the DyStyle network, we propose a Dynamic Multi-Attribute Contrastive Learning (DmaCL) method: including dynamic multi-attribute contrastor and dynamic multi-attribute contrastive loss, which simultaneously disentangle a variety of attributes from the generative image and latent space of model. As a result, our approach demonstrates fine-grained disentangled edits along multiple numeric and binary attributes.

Instead, we solve this problem by presenting ElliPose, Stereoscopic 3D Human Pose Estimation by Fitting Ellipsoids, where we jointly estimate the 3D human as well as the camera pose. We exploit the fact that bones do not change in length over the course of a sequence and thus their relative trajectories have to lie on the surface of a sphere which we can utilize to iteratively correct the camera and 3D pose estimation. As another use-case we demonstrate that our approach can be used as replacement for ground-truth 3D poses to train monocular 3D pose estimators.

However, different attention maps methods can highlight different regions of the input, with sometimes contradictory explanations for a prediction. This effect is exacerbated when the training set is small. This indicates that either the model learned incorrect representations or that the attention maps methods did not accurately estimate the model's representations. We propose an unsupervised fine-tuning method that optimizes the consistency of attention maps and show that it improves both classification performance and the quality of attention maps. We propose an implementation for two state-of-the-art attention computation methods, Grad-CAM and Guided Backpropagation, which relies on an input masking technique. We also show results on Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients in an ablation study. We evaluate this method on our own dataset of event detection in continuous video recordings of hospital patients aggregated and curated for this work. As a sanity check, we also evaluate the proposed method on PASCAL VOC and SVHN. With the proposed method, with small training sets, we achieve a 6.6 points lift of F1 score over the baselines on our video dataset, a 2.9 point lift of F1 score on PASCAL, and a 1.8 points lift of mean Intersection over Union over Grad-CAM for weakly supervised detection on PASCAL.

MC-SBIG is a challenging task that requires strong prior knowledge due to the significant domain gap between sketches and natural images. Existing learning-based approaches rely on a large-scale paired dataset to learn the mapping between these two image modalities. However, since the public paired sketch-photo data are scarce, it is struggling for learning-based methods to achieve satisfactory results. In this work, we introduce a new approach based on GAN inversion, which can utilize a powerful pretrained generator to facilitate image generation from a given sketch. Our GAN inversion-based method has two advantages: 1. it can freely take advantage of the prior knowledge of a pretrained image generator; 2. it allows the proposed model to focus on learning the mapping from a sketch to a low-dimension latent code, which is a much easier task than directly mapping to a high-dimension natural image. We also present a novel shape loss to improve generation quality further. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that our method can produce sketch-faithful and photo-realistic images and significantly outperform the baseline methods."}

Leveraging the online knowledge distillation framework, we propose the \"FAN-Trans\" method for AU detection. Our model consists of a hybrid network of convolution layers and transformer blocks designed to learn per-AU features and to model AU co-occurrences. The model uses a pre-trained face alignment network as the feature extractor. After further transformation by a small learnable add-on convolutional subnet, the per-AU features are fed into transformer blocks to enhance their representation. As multiple AUs often appear together, we propose a learnable attention drop mechanism in the transformer block to learn the correlation between the features for different AUs. We also design a classifier that predicts AU presence by considering all AUs' features, to explicitly capture label dependencies. Finally, we make the first attempt of adapting online knowledge distillation in the training stage for this task, further improving the model's performance.

Both part segmentation and structure inference have been extensively studied in the recent deep learning literature, while the supervisions used for each task have not been fully exploited to assist the other task. Namely, structure inference has been typically conducted with an autoencoder that does not leverage the point-to-part associations. Also, segmentation has been mostly performed without structural priors that tell the plausibility of the output segments. We present how these two tasks can be best combined while fully utilizing supervision to improve performance. Our framework first decomposes a raw input shape into part segments using an off-the-shelf algorithm, whose outputs are then mapped to nodes in a part hierarchy, establishing point-to-part associations. Following this, ours predicts the structural information, e.g., part bounding boxes and part relationships. Lastly, the segmentation is rectified by examining the confusion of part boundaries using the structure-based part features. Our experimental results based on the StructureNet and PartNet demonstrate that the interplay between the two tasks results in remarkable improvements in both tasks: 27.91% in structure inference and 0.5% in segmentation."}

State-of-art methods rely on multiple independent stages, where initial spatio-temporal proposals are generated using visual and motion cues, and then prominent objects are identified and refined. The localization involves solving an optimization problem over one or more videos, and video tags are typically used for video clustering. This process requires a model per video or per class making for costly inference. Moreover, localized regions are not necessary discriminant because these methods rely on unsupervised motion methods like optical flow, or discarded video tags from optimization. In this paper, we leverage the successful class activation mapping (CAM) methods, designed for WSOL based on still images. A new Temporal CAM (TCAM) method is introduced for training a discriminant deep learning (DL) model to exploit spatio-temporal information in videos, using an CAM-Temporal Max Pooling (CAM-TMP) aggregation mechanism over consecutive CAMs. In particular, activations of regions of interest (ROIs) are collected from CAMs produced by a pretrained CNN classifier, and generate pixel-wise pseudo-labels for training a decoder. In addition, a global unsupervised size constraint, and local constraint such as CRF are used to yield more accurate CAMs. Inference over single independent frames allows parallel processing of a clip of frames, and real-time localization. Extensive experiments on two challenging YouTube-Objects datasets with unconstrained videos indicate that CAM methods (trained on independent frames) can yield decent localization accuracy. Our proposed TCAM method achieves a new state-of-art in WSVOL accuracy, and visual results suggest that it can be adapted for subsequent tasks, such as object detection and tracking."}

And how can we implement this in a practical manner? This paper proposes a training strategy to ConveY Brain Oversight to Raise Generalization (CYBORG). This new approach incorporates human-annotated saliency maps into a loss function that guides the model's learning to focus on image regions that humans deem salient for the task. The Class Activation Mapping (CAM) mechanism is used to probe the model's current saliency in each training batch, juxtapose this model saliency with human saliency, and penalize large differences. Results on the task of synthetic face detection, selected to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach, show that CYBORG leads to significant improvement in accuracy on unseen samples consisting of face images generated from six Generative Adversarial Networks across multiple classification network architectures. We also show that scaling to even seven times the training data, or using non-human-saliency auxiliary information, such as segmentation masks, and standard loss cannot beat the performance of CYBORG-trained models. As a side effect of this work, we observe that the addition of explicit region annotation to the task of synthetic face detection increased human classification accuracy. This work opens a new area of research on how to incorporate human visual saliency into loss functions in practice. All data, code and pre-trained models used in this work are offered with this paper."}

Visual localization algorithms determine the position and orientation from which an image has been captured, using a set of geo-referenced images or a 3D scene representation. Our new localization paradigm, named Implicit Pose Encoding (ImPosing), embeds images and camera poses into a common latent representation with 2 separate neural networks, such that we can compute a similarity score for each image-pose pair. By evaluating candidates through the latent space in a hierarchical manner, the camera position and orientation are not directly regressed but incrementally refined. Very large environments force competitors to store gigabytes of map data, whereas our method is very compact independently of the reference database size. In this paper, we describe how to effectively optimize our learned modules, how to combine them to achieve real-time localization, and demonstrate results on diverse large scale scenarios that significantly outperform prior work in accuracy and computational efficiency."}

We focus on one such representation, scene graphs, and propose a novel scene expansion task where we enrich an input seed graph by adding new nodes (objects) and the corresponding relationships. To this end, we formulate scene graph expansion as a sequential prediction task involving multiple iterations of first predicting a new node and then predicting the set of relationships between the newly predicted node and previously chosen nodes in the graph. We propose and evaluate a sequencing strategy that retains the clustering patterns amongst nodes. In addition, we leverage external knowledge to train our graph generation model, enabling greater generalization of node predictions. Due to the inefficiency of existing maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) based metrics standard for graph generation problems, we design novel metrics that comprehensively evaluate different aspects of node and relation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on Visual Genome and VRD datasets to evaluate the expanded scene graphs using the standard MMD based metrics and our proposed metrics. We observe that the graphs generated by our method, GEMS, better represent the real distribution of the scene graphs compared with baseline methods like GraphRNN."}

In dominant approaches to iris recognition, the size of a ring-shaped iris region is linearly scaled to a canonical rectangle, used further in encoding and matching. However, the biological complexity of the iris sphincter and dilator muscles causes the movements of iris features to be nonlinear in a function of pupil size, and not solely organized along radial paths. Alternatively to the existing theoretical models based on the biomechanics of iris musculature, in this paper we propose a novel deep autoencoder-based model that can effectively learn complex movements of iris texture features directly from the data. The proposed model takes two inputs, (a) an ISO-compliant near-infrared iris image with initial pupil size, and (b) the binary mask defining the target shape of the iris. The model makes all the necessary nonlinear deformations to the iris texture to match the shape of the iris in an image (a) with the shape provided by the target mask (b). The identity-preservation component of the loss function helps the model in finding deformations that preserve identity and not only the visual realism of the generated samples. We also demonstrate two immediate applications of this model: better compensation for iris texture deformations in iris recognition algorithms, compared to linear models, and the creation of a generative algorithm that can aid human forensic examiners, who may need to compare iris images with a large difference in pupil dilation. We offer the source codes and model weights available along with this paper."}

However, existing works follow similar settings where the training and testing datasets share the same musical instrument categories, which to some extent limits the versatility of this task. In this work, we focus on a more general and challenging scenario, namely the separation of unknown musical instruments, where the categories in training and testing phases have no overlap with each other. To tackle this new setting, we propose the \"Separation-with-Consistency\" (SeCo) framework, which can accomplish the separation on unknown categories by exploiting the consistency constraints. Furthermore, to capture richer characteristics of the novel melodies, we devise an online matching strategy, which can bring stable enhancements with no cost of extra parameters. Experiments demonstrate that our SeCo framework exhibits strong adaptation ability on the novel musical categories and outperforms the baseline methods by a notable margin."}

However, the cross-modal attention models of existing methods could be sub-optimal and inaccurate because there is no direct supervision provided during the training process. In this work, we propose two novel training strategies, namely Contrastive Content Re-sourcing (CCR) and Contrastive Content Swapping (CCS) constraints, to address such limitations. These constraints supervise the training of cross-modal attention models in a contrastive learning manner without requiring explicit attention annotations. They are plug-in training strategies and can be generally integrated into existing cross-modal attention models. Additionally, we introduce three metrics, including Attention Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, to quantitatively measure the quality of learned attention models. We evaluate the proposed constraints by incorporating them into four state-of-the-art cross-modal attention-based image-text matching models. Experimental results on both Flickr30k and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate that integrating these constraints generally improves the model performance in terms of both retrieval performance and attention metrics."}

Different from existing models that translate to hand sign language, between speech and text, or text and images, we target immediate and low-level audio to video translation that applies to generic environment sounds as well as human speech. Since such a substitution is artificial, without labels for supervised learning, our core contribution is to build a mapping from audio to video that learns from unpaired examples via high-level constraints. For speech, we additionally disentangle content from style, such as gender and dialect. Qualitative and quantitative results, including a human study, demonstrate that our unpaired translation approach maintains important audio features in the generated video and that videos of faces and numbers are well suited for visualizing high-dimensional audio features that can be parsed by humans to match and distinguish between sounds and words.

Since anomalies by definition cannot be learned, their detection must rely on a very accurate \"normality model\". To this aim, we introduce here a global-to-local Gaussian model for neural network features, learned from a set of normal images. This probabilistic model enables unsupervised anomaly detection. A global Gaussian mixture model of the features is first learned using all available features from normal data. This global Gaussian mixture model is then localized by an adaptation of the K-MLE algorithm, which learns a spatial weight map for each Gaussian. These weights are then used instead of the mixture weights to detect anomalies. This method enables precise modeling of complex data, even with limited data. Applied on WideResnet50-2 features, our approach outperforms the previous state of the art on the MVTec dataset, particularly on the object category. It is robust to perturbations that are frequent in production lines, such as imperfect alignment, and is on par in terms of memory and computation time with the previous state of the art."}

Examples of such solutions comprise quantization, i.e. converting the processing values (weights and inputs) from floating point into integers e.g. int8 or int4. Concurrently, the rise of privacy concerns motivated the study of less invasive acceleration methods, such as data-free quantization of pre-trained models weights and activations. Previous approaches either exploit statistical information to deduce scalar ranges and scaling factors for the activations in a static manner, or dynamically adapt this range on-the-fly for each input of each layers (also referred to as activations): the latter generally being more accurate at the expanse of significantly slower inference. In this work, we argue that static input quantization can reach the accuracy levels of dynamic methods by means of a per-channel input quantization scheme that allows one to more finely preserve cross-channel dynamics. We show through a thorough empirical evaluation on multiple computer vision problems (e.g. ImageNet classification, Pascal VOC object detection as well as CityScapes semantic segmentation) that the proposed method, dubbed SPIQ, achieves accuracies rivalling dynamic approaches with static-level inference speed, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art quantization methods on every benchmark."}

In this paper, we propose TransMOT, which leverages powerful graph transformers to efficiently model the spatial and temporal interactions among the objects. TransMOT is capable of effectively modeling the interactions of a large number of objects by arranging the trajectories of the tracked targets and detection candidates as a set of sparse weighted graphs, and constructing a spatial graph transformer encoder layer, a temporal transformer encoder layer, and a spatial graph transformer decoder layer based on the graphs. Through end-to-end learning, TransMOT can exploit the spatial-temporal clues to directly estimate association from a large number of loosely filtered detection predictions for robust MOT in complex scenes. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, including MOT15, MOT16, MOT17, and MOT20, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets."}

Given the need for lowering the time cost of multiple acquisitions, current deep accelerated MRI reconstruction networks focus on exploiting the redundancy between multiple contrasts. However, existing works are largely supervised with paired data and/or prohibitively expensive fully-sampled MRI sequences. Further, reconstruction networks typically rely on convolutional architectures which are limited in their capacity to model long-range interactions and may lead to suboptimal recovery of fine anatomical detail. To these ends, we present a dual-domain self-supervised transformer (DSFormer) for accelerated MC-MRI reconstruction. DSFormer develops a deep conditional cascade transformer (DCCT) consisting of cascaded Swin transformer reconstruction networks (SwinRN) trained under two deep conditioning strategies to enable MC-MRI information sharing. We further use a dual-domain (image and k-space) self-supervised learning strategy for DCCT to alleviate the costs of acquiring fully sampled training data. DSFormer generates high-fidelity reconstructions which outperform current fully-supervised baselines. Moreover, we find that DSFormer achieves nearly the same performance when trained either with full supervision or with the proposed self-supervision."}

To solve these problems, we propose Spatio-TemporAl cRoss (STAR)-transformer, which can effectively represent two cross-modal features as a recognizable vector. First, from the input video and skeleton sequence, video frames are output as global grid tokens and skeletons are output as joint map tokens, respectively. These tokens are then aggregated into multi-class tokens and input into STAR-transformer. The STAR-transformer encoder consists of a full spatio-temporal attention (FAttn) module and a proposed zigzag spatio-temporal attention (ZAttn) module. Similarly, the continuous decoder consists of a FAttn module and a proposed binary spatio-temporal attention (BAttn) module. STAR-transformer learns an efficient multi-feature representation of the spatio-temporal features by properly arranging pairings of the FAttn, ZAttn, and BAttn modules. Experimental results on the Penn-Action, NTU-RGB+D 60, and 120 datasets show that the proposed method achieves a promising improvement in performance in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods."}

Atmospheric turbulence causes significant degradation to image quality by introducing blur and geometric distortion. In recent years, various deep learning-based single image atmospheric turbulence mitigation methods, including CNN-based and GAN inversion-based, have been proposed in the literature which attempt to remove the distortion in the image. However, some of these methods are difficult to train and often fail to reconstruct facial features and produce unrealistic results, especially in the case of high turbulence. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently gained some traction because of their stable training process and their ability to generate high quality images. In this paper, we propose the first DDPM-based solution for the problem of atmospheric turbulence mitigation. We also propose a fast sampling technique for reducing the inference times for conditional DDPMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world data to show the significance of our model.

There are at least three advantages of incorporating decision trees and graphs: they are easy to interpret since they are based on sequential decisions, they can make decisions faster, and they provide a hierarchy of classes. However, one of the well-known drawbacks of decision trees, as compared to decision graphs, is that decision trees cannot reuse the decision nodes. Nevertheless, decision graphs were not commonly used in deep learning due to the lack of efficient gradient-based training techniques. In this paper, we fill this gap and provide a general paradigm based on Markov processes, which allows for efficient training of the special type of decision graphs, which we call Self-Organizing Neural Graphs (SONG). We provide a theoretical study on SONG, complemented by experiments conducted on Letter, Connect4, MNIST, CIFAR, and TinyImageNet datasets, showing that our method performs on par or better than existing decision models."}

Poses are subsequently estimated using the Perspective-n-Points algorithm at runtime. Unfortunately, multi-model formulations are slow and do not scale well with the number of object instances involved. Recent approaches show that direct 6D object pose estimation is feasible when derived from the aforementioned geometric correspondences. We present an approach that learns an intermediate geometric representation of multiple objects to directly regress 6D poses of all instances in a test image. The inherent end-to-end trainability overcomes the requirement of separately processing individual object instances. By calculating the mutual Intersection-over-Unions, pose hypotheses are clustered into distinct instances, which achieves negligible runtime overhead with respect to the number of object instances. Results on multiple challenging standard datasets show that the pose estimation performance is superior to single-model state-of-the-art approaches despite being more than  35 times faster. We additionally provide an analysis showing real-time applicability (>24 fps) for images where more than 90 object instances are present. Further results show the advantage of supervising geometric correspondence-based object pose estimation with the 6D pose."}

However, learning unknown types of anomalies using an unsupervised approach is more practical than a supervised approach as annotation is an extra burden. In this paper, we use isolation tree-based unsupervised clustering to partition the deep feature space of the video segments. The RGB- stream generates a pseudo anomaly score and the flow stream generates a pseudo dynamicity score of a video segment. These scores are then fused using a majority voting scheme to generate preliminary bags of positive and negative segments. However, these bags may not be accurate as the scores are generated only using the current segment which does not represent the global behavior of a typical anomalous event. We then use a refinement strategy based on a cross-branch feed-forward network designed using a popular I3D network to refine both scores. The bags are then refined through a segment re-mapping strategy. The intuition of adding the dynamicity score of a segment with the anomaly score is to enhance the quality of the evidence. The method has been evaluated on three popular video anomaly datasets, i.e., UCF-Crime, CCTV-Fights, and UBI-Fights. Experimental results reveal that the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art video anomaly detection methods."}

While the global perspective effect shown as size and position variations has been exploited for monocular 3D detection extensively, the local perspectives has long been overlooked. We propose a new regression target named keyedge-ratios as the parameterization of the local shape distortion to account for the local perspective, and derive the object depth and yaw angle from it. Theoretically, this approach does not rely on the absolute size or position of the objects in the image, therefore independent of the camera intrinsic parameters. This approach provides a new perspective for monocular 3D reasoning and can be plugged in flexibly to existing monocular 3D object detection frameworks. We demonstrate effectiveness and superior performance over strong baseline methods in multiple datasets."}

In this paper, we discuss the necessity of considering the difference between the feature space and the distribution when performing multimodal learning. We deal with this problem through deep learning and a generative model approach. We introduce a novel network, GAFNet (Global Attention Fourier Net) which learns through large-scale pre-training over three image-text datasets (COCO, SBU, and CC-3M), for achieving high performance on downstream vision and language tasks. We propose a GAF (Global Attention Fourier) module, which integrates multiple modalities into one latent space. GAF module is independent of the type of modality and it allows combining shared representations at each stage. There are various ways of thinking about the relationships between different modalities, which directly affect the model's design. Global attention is not considered as in conventional multimodal learning. A GAF-based model can work for any modality (language, image, audio, category) and is designed to be used for different tasks. In contrast to previous research, our work considers visual grounding as a pretrainable and transferable quality instead of something that must be trained from scratch. Experimental results demonstrate that our technique is competitive and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of popular downstream vision-language tasks, including image generation and image-text retrieval."}

Our benchmark is curated by an in-game simulator with diverse scenes and various jittering effects. Moreover, we propose a simple yet strong baseline approach, named Motion-Trajectory Smoothing Network (MTSNet), by fully exploiting our Sim2RealVS data. Our MTSNet consists of three main steps: motion estimation, global trajectory smoothing and frame warping. In motion estimation, we design a Motion Correction and Completion (MCC) module to rectify the optical flow with low confidence, such as in textureless regions, thus providing more consistent motion estimation for next steps. Benefiting from our synthetic data, we can explicitly learn a Trajectory Smoothing Transformer (TST) with ground-truth supervision to smooth global trajectories. In training TST, we propose two fully-supervised losses, i.e., a motion magnitude similarity loss and a motion tendency similarity loss. After training, our TST is able to produce smooth motion trajectories for the shaky input videos. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our MTSNet achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real-world data."}

However, data augmentation techniques are limited to the \"seen\" pose combinations and hard to infer poses with rare \"unseen\" joint positions. To address this problem, we present CameraPose, a weakly-supervised framework for 3D human pose estimation from a single image, which can not only be applied on 2D-3D pose pairs but also on 2D alone annotations. By adding a camera parameter branch, any in-the-wild 2D annotations can be fed into our pipeline to boost the training diversity and the 3D poses can be implicitly learned by reprojecting back to 2D. Moreover, CameraPose introduces a refinement network module with confidence-guided loss to further improve the quality of noisy 2D keypoints extracted by 2D pose estimators. Experimental results demonstrate that the CameraPose brings in clear improvements on cross-scenario datasets. Notably, it outperforms the baseline method by 3mm on the most challenging dataset 3DPW.
