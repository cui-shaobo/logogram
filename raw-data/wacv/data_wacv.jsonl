Practically, an LED light source is attached to a commodity RGB-D sensor and is used to capture objects from multiple viewpoints with unknown motion. This non-static camera-to-object setup is described with a nonconvex variational approach such that no calibration on lighting or camera motion is require due to the formulation of an end-to-end joint optimization problem. Solving the proposed variational model results in high resolution depth, reflectance and camera estimates, as we show on challenging synthetic and real-world datasets."}

The benefit of this work lies in its simplicity of implementation, strong theoretical justification to the motion and structure estimation, and its invincible originality.  Despite this, the prevailing view is, that it performs exceedingly inferior to other methods on several benchmark datasets [??]. However, our subtle investigation provides some empirical statistics which made us think against such views. The statistical results we obtained supersedes Dai  \\it et al.  [??] originally reported results on the benchmark datasets by a significant margin under some elementary changes in their core algorithmic idea [??]. Now, these results not only exposes some unrevealed areas for research in NRSfM but also give rise to new mathematical challenges for NRSfM researchers. We argue that by properly utilizing the well-established assumptions about a non-rigidly deforming shape i.e, it deforms smoothly over frames [??] and it spans a low-rank space, the simple prior-free idea can provide results which is comparable to the best available algorithms. In this paper, we explore some of the hidden intricacies missed by Dai  \\it et. al.   work [??] and how some elementary measures and modifications can enhance its performance, as high as approx. 18% on the benchmark dataset. The improved performance is justified and empirically verified by extensive experiments on several datasets. We believe our work has both practical and theoretical importance for the development of better NRSfM algorithms."}

This work presents a novel autoregressive model, PointGrow, which can generate diverse and realistic point cloud samples from scratch or conditioned on semantic contexts. This model operates recurrently, with each point sampled according to a conditional distribution given its previously-generated points, allowing inter-point correlations to be well-exploited and 3D shape generative processes to be better interpreted. Since point cloud object shapes are typically encoded by long-range dependencies, we augment our model with dedicated self-attention modules to capture such relations. Extensive evaluations show that PointGrow achieves satisfying performance on both unconditional and conditional point cloud generation tasks, with respect to realism and diversity. Several important applications, such as unsupervised feature learning and shape arithmetic operations, are also demonstrated."}

Inspired by classical methods, FlowNet3D++ incorporates geometric constraints in the form of point-toplane distance and angular alignment between individual vectors in the flow field, into FlowNet3D. We demonstrate that the addition of these geometric loss terms improves the previous state-of-art FlowNet3D accuracy from 57.85% to 63.43%. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our geometric constraints, we propose a benchmark for flow estimation on the task of dynamic 3D reconstruction, thus providing a more holistic and practical measure of performance than the breakdown of individual metrics previously used to evaluate scene flow. This is made possible through the contribution of a novel pipeline to integrate point-based scene flow predictions into a global dense volume. FlowNet3D++ achieves up to a 15.0% reduction in reconstruction error over FlowNet3D, and up to a 35.2% improvement over KillingFusion alone. We will release our scene flow estimation code later."}

Consequently, occluded surfaces are possible to be reconstructed from LF images.  In this paper, we handle the LF de-occlusion (LF-DeOcc) problem using a deep encoder-decoder network (namely, DeOccNet). In our method, sub-aperture images (SAIs) are first given to the encoder to incorporate both spatial and angular information. The encoded representations are then used by the decoder to render an occlusion-free center-view SAI. To the best of our knowledge, DeOccNet is the first deep learning-based LF-DeOcc method. To handle the insufficiency of training data, we propose an LF synthesis approach to embed selected occlusion masks into existing LF images. Besides, several synthetic and real-world LFs are developed for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that, after training on the generated data, our DeOccNet can effectively remove foreground occlusions and achieves superior performance as compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Subsequently, the fused matching can be used directly for the cost aggregation and disparity estimation. The benefits of the proposed fusion strategy are demonstrated by an evaluation based on synthetic and real-world data. To encourage further comparisons on triple stereo algorithms, the dataset used for evaluation is made publicly available."}

We evaluate EyeGAN against competing eye image synthesis algorithms by measuring a specific gaze consistency index. In addition, we present results from multiple experiments (involving eye region segmentation, pupil localization, and gaze direction estimation) showing that the use of EyeGAN generated images with inherited annotations for network training leads to superior performances compared to other domain transfer algorithms."}

This task is typically left to artists, as it has proven difficult to capture subjects' unique characteristics well using automated methods. Recent development of deep end-to-end methods has achieved promising results in capturing style and higher-level exaggerations. However, a key part of caricatures, face warping, has remained challenging for these systems. In this work, we propose AutoToon, the first supervised deep learning method that yields high-quality warps for the warping component of caricatures. Completely disentangled from style, it can be paired with any stylization method to create diverse caricatures. In contrast to prior art, we leverage an SENet and spatial transformer module and train directly on artist warping fields, applying losses both prior to and after warping. As shown by our user studies, we achieve appealing exaggerations that amplify distinguishing features of the face while preserving facial detail."}

We implicitly impose facial component-wise attention maps using a segmentation network to allow our network to focus on face-inherent patterns. Each stage of our network is composed of a stem layer, a residual backbone, and spatial upsampling layers. We recurrently apply stages to reconstruct an intermediate image, and then reuse its space-to-depth converted versions to bootstrap and enhance image quality progressively.

State-of-the-art estimators ad-dress this problem by regularizing3D hand pose estimationmodels during training to enforce the consistency betweenthe predicted3D poses and the ground truth depth maps.However, these estimators rely on the availability of bothRGB images and paired depth maps during training.

The first stage is designed for pure vision estimation.

In order to find and classify video time segments that correspond to relevant action classes, a system must be able to both identify discriminative time segments in each video, and identify the full extent of each action. Achieving this with weak video level labels requires the system to use similarity and dissimilarity between moments across videos in the training data to understand both how an action appears, as well as the sub-actions that comprise the action's full extent. However, current methods do not make explicit use of similarity between video moments to inform the localization and classification predictions. We present a novel method that uses graph convolutions to explicitly model similarity between video moments. Our method utilizes similarity graphs that encode appearance and motion, and pushes the state of the art on THUMOS `14, ActivityNet 1.2, and Charades for weakly-supervised action localization."}

In recent work, both streams are 3D Convolutional Neural Networks, which extract features using spatiotemporal filters. These filters can respond to motion, and therefore should allow the network to learn motion representations, removing the need for optical flow. However, we still see significant benefits in performance by feeding optical flow into the temporal stream, indicating that the spatial stream is \"missing\" some of the signal that the temporal stream captures. In this work, we first investigate whether motion representations are indeed missing in the spatial stream, and show that there is significant room for improvement. Second, we demonstrate that these motion representations can be improved using distillation, that is, by tuning the spatial stream to mimic the temporal stream, effectively combining both models into a single stream. Finally, we show that our Distilled 3D Network (D3D) achieves performance on par with the two-stream approach, with no need to compute optical flow during inference."}

In contrast to existing works on object trajectory forecasting which primarily consider the problem from a birds-eye perspective, we formulate the problem from an object-level perspective and call for the prediction of full object bounding boxes, rather than trajectories alone. Towards solving this task, we introduce the Citywalks dataset, which consists of over 200k high-resolution video frames. Citywalks comprises of footage recorded in 21 cities from 10 European countries in a variety of weather conditions and over 3.5k unique pedestrian trajectories. For evaluation, we adapt existing trajectory forecasting methods for MOF and confirm cross-dataset generalizability on the MOT-17 dataset without fine-tuning.  Finally,  we present STED, a novel encoder-decoder architecture for MOF. STED combines visual and temporal features to model both object-motion and ego-motion, and outperforms existing approaches for MOF.

The state-of-the-art object detection designed for optical images cannot address the issues because of the inherent differentiation between the optical image and sonar image. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an adversarial training method to generalize the detector by introducing perturbation with specific noise property of sonar images during training stage. We design a sideway network which we name Noise Adversarial Network (NAN). The NAN is embedded into the state-of-the-art detector to generate adversarial examples which serve as assistant decision-making items to predict both class and bounding box, aiming to improve the generalization and noise robustness of the detector. To provide prior knowledge of noise perturbation to NAN, we also design a Noise Block (NB) for introducing noise in the upstream layers, which further improves noise robustness. Following the Faster R-CNN framework, the results of our experiments indicate a 8.9% mAP boost on our sonar image dataset. The detector equipped with NAN and NB also outperforms the baseline on noised test sets. Furthermore, it gains a 2.4% mAP boost on the optical image dataset PASCAL VOC 2007."}

The development and evaluation of new approaches relies heavily on benchmark datasets; such datasets are generally built primarily with categories that have images readily available, omitting categories with insufficient data. This paper takes a step back and rethinks dataset construction, focusing on intelligent image collection driven by: (i) the inclusion of all desired categories, and, (ii) the recognition performance on those categories. Based on a small, author-provided initial dataset, the proposed system recommends which categories the authors should prioritize collecting additional images for, with the intent of optimizing overall categorization accuracy. We show that mock datasets built using this method outperform datasets built without such a guiding framework. Additional experiments give prospective dataset creators intuition into how, based on their circumstances and goals, a dataset should be constructed."}

Such images narrow our vision in a restricted region. On the other hand, 360deg images provide a thorough sight. In this paper, our goal is to provide a standard dataset to facilitate the vision and machine learning communities in 360deg domain. To facilitate the research, we present a real-world 360deg panoramic object detection dataset, 360-Indoor, which is a new benchmark for visual object detection and class recognition in 360deg indoor images. It is achieved by gathering images of complex indoor scenes containing common objects and the intensive annotated bounding field-of-view. In addition, 360-Indoor has several distinct properties: (1) the largest category number (37 labels in total). (2) the most complete annotations on average (27 bounding boxes per image). The selected 37 objects are all common in indoor scene. With around 3k images and 90k labels in total, 360-Indoor achieves the largest dataset for detection in 360deg images.

The goal of CL is to learn new tasks while maintaining the performance on the previously learned tasks. There are two major obstacles for CL of deep neural networks: catastrophic forgetting and limited model capacity. Inspired by the recent breakthroughs in automatically learning good neural network architectures, we develop a nonexpansive AutoML framework for CL termed Regularize, Expand and Compress (REC) to solve the above issues. REC is a unified framework with three highlights: 1) a novel regularized weight consolidation (RWC) algorithm to avoid forgetting, where accessing the data seen in the previously learned tasks is not required; 2) an automatic neural architecture search (AutoML) engine to expand the network to increase model capability; 3) smart compression of the expanded model after a new task is learned to improve the model efficiency. The experimental results on four different image recognition datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed REC over other CL algorithms."}

As a result, the previous methods cannot guarantee that the generated visual features can truthfully reflect the corresponding semantics. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Cycle-consistent Adversarial Networks for Zero-Shot Learning (CANZSL). It encourages a visual feature generator to synthesize realistic visual features from semantics, and then inversely translate back the synthesized visual features to the corresponding semantic space by a semantic feature generator. Furthermore, in this paper a more challenging and practical ZSL problem is considered where the original semantics are from natural language with irrelevant words instead of clean semantics, which are widely used in previous work. Specifically, a multi-modal consistent bidirectional generative adversarial model is trained to handle unseen instances by suppressing noise in the natural language. A forward one-to-many mapping from the class level descriptions to the visual features is coupled with an inverse many-to-one mapping from the visual space to the semantic space. Thus, a multi-modal cycle-consistency loss between the synthesized semantic representations and the ground truth can be learned and leveraged to enforce the generated semantic features to approximate to the real distribution in semantic space. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on natural language-based zero-shot learning tasks."}

The convolutional filters used in CNNs have played a major role in this success, by extracting useful features from the inputs. Recently researchers have tried to boost the performance of CNNs by re-calibrating the feature maps produced by these filters, e.g., Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENets). These approaches have achieved better performance by Exciting up the important channels or feature maps while diminishing the rest. However, in the process, architectural complexity has increased. We propose an architectural block that introduces much lower complexity than the existing methods of CNN performance boosting while performing significantly better than them. We carry out experiments on the CIFAR, ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets, and show that the proposed block can challenge the state-of-the-art results. Our method boosts the ResNet-50 architecture to perform comparably to the ResNet-152 architecture, which is a three times deeper network, on classification. We also show experimentally that our method is not limited to classification but also generalizes well to other tasks such as object detection."}

However, a number of fundamental questions about pruning are not answered yet. For example, do the pruned neural networks contain the same representations as the original network? Is pruning a compression or evolution process? Does pruning only work on trained neural networks? What is the role and value of the uncovered sparsity structure? In this paper, we strive to answer these questions by analyzing three unstructured pruning methods (magnitude based pruning, post-pruning re-initialization, and random sparse initialization). We conduct extensive experiments using the Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA) tool to study and contrast layer representations of pruned and original ResNet, VGG, and ConvNet models. We have several interesting observations: 1) Pruned neural network models evolve to substantially different representations while still maintaining similar accuracy. 2) Initialized sparse models can achieve reasonably good accuracy compared to well-engineered pruning methods. 3) Sparsity structures discovered by pruning models are not inherently important or useful."}

Despite the significant performance improvement using the deep structures, they still require prohibitive runtime to process images and maintain the highest possible performance for real-time applications. Observing the phenomenon that human visual system (HVS) relies heavily on the temporal dependencies among frames from the visual input to conduct recognition efficiently, we propose a novel framework dubbed as TKD: temporal knowledge distillation. This framework distills the temporal knowledge from a heavy neural network-based model over selected video frames (the perception of the moments) to a light-weight model. To enable the distillation, we put forward two novel procedures: 1) a Long-short Term Memory (LSTM)-based key frame selection method; and 2) a novel teacher-bounded loss design. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations using different object detection methods over multiple datasets including Youtube Objects and Hollywood scene dataset. Our results show consistent improvement in accuracy-speed trade-offs for object detection over the frames of the dynamic scene, compared to other modern object recognition methods.

In this work we focus on their ability to have invariance towards the presence or absence of details.  For example, humans are able to watch cartoons, which are missing many visual details, without being explicitly trained to do so.  As another example, 3D rendering software is a relatively recent development, yet people are able to understand such rendered scenes even though they are missing details (consider a film like Toy Story).  This capability goes beyond visual data: humans are easily able to recognize isolated melodies from musical pieces when heard for the first time, even if the only piece they've listened to previously is from an orchestra.  Thus the failure of machine learning algorithms to do this indicates a significant gap in generalization between human abilities and the abilities of deep networks.  We propose a dataset that will make it easier to study the  detail-invariance problem concretely.  We produce a concrete task for this: SketchTransfer, and we show that state-of-the-art domain transfer algorithms still struggle with this task.  The state-of-the-art technique which achieves over 95% on MNIST \\xrightarrow   SVHN transfer only achieves 59% accuracy on the SketchTransfer task, which is much better than random (11% accuracy) but falls short of the 87% accuracy of a classifier trained directly on labeled sketches.

It is worth noting that existing ResNets and DenseNets are both special cases of our ADNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture consistently and indubitably achieves competitive results in accuracy on benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN), while at the same time remarkably reduces computational costs and memory space.

One of the core aspects of evaluating object detectors has been the ability to avoid false detections. While major datasets like PASCAL VOC or MSCOCO extensively test the detectors on their ability to avoid false positives, they do not differentiate between their closed-set and open-set performance. Despite systems being trained to reject everything other than the classes of interest, unknown objects from the open world end up being incorrectly detected as known objects, often with very high confidence. This paper is the first to formalize the problem of open-set object detection and propose the first open-set object detection protocol. Moreover, the paper provides a new evaluation metric to analyze the performance of some state-of-the-art detectors and discusses their performance differences."}

Given the lack of methods capable of assessing such probabilistic object detections, we present the new Probability-based Detection Quality measure (PDQ). Unlike AP-based measures, PDQ has no arbitrary thresholds and rewards spatial and label quality, and foreground/background separation quality while explicitly penalising false positive and false negative detections. We contrast PDQ with existing mAP and moLRP measures by evaluating state-of-the-art detectors and a Bayesian object detector based on Monte Carlo Dropout. Our experiments indicate that conventional object detectors tend to be spatially overconfident and thus perform poorly on the task of probabilistic object detection. Our paper aims to encourage the development of new object detection approaches that provide detections with accurately estimated spatial and label uncertainties and are of critical importance for deployment on robots and embodied AI systems in the real world."}

While their zooming ability allows acquiring detailed images of the scene, it also makes their calibration more challenging since any zooming action results in a modification of their intrinsic parameters. Therefore, such camera calibration has to be computed online; this process is called self-calibration. In this paper, given an image pair captured by a PTZ camera, we propose a deep learning based approach to automatically estimate the focal length and distortion parameters of both images as well as the rotation angles between them. The proposed approach relies on a dual-Siamese structure, imposing bidirectional constraints. The proposed network is trained on a large-scale dataset automatically generated from a set of panoramas. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves competitive performance with respect to both deep learning-based and traditional state-of-the art methods. Our code and model will be publicly available at https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/DeepPTZ."}

Recent works on OR showed some promis- ing results on the accuracy. In our ablation study, however, we do not observe such significant improvement from exist- ing OR techniques compared with the conventional training based on weight decay, dropout, and batch normalization. To identify the real gain from OR, inspired by the locality sensitive hashing (LSH) in angle estimation, we propose to introduce an implicit self-regularization into OR to push the mean and variance of filter angles in a network towards 90 * and 0 * simultaneously to achieve (near) orthogonality among the filters, without using any other explicit regular- ization. Our regularization can be implemented as an archi- tectural plug-in and integrated with an arbitrary network. We reveal that OR helps stabilize the training process and leads to faster convergence and better generalization."}

However, in this paper, we demonstrate that these edge detectors inherit a troubling property of neural networks: they can be fooled by adversarial examples. We show that adding small perturbations to an image causes HED, a CNN-based edge detection model, to fail to locate edges, to detect nonexistent edges, and even to hallucinate arbitrary configurations of edges. More importantly, we find that these adversarial examples blindly transfer to other CNN-based vision models. In particular, attacks on edge detection result in significant drops in accuracy in models trained to perform unrelated, high-level tasks like image classification and semantic segmentation."}

The I-MOVE dataset provides an opportunity for generalizable velocity estimation models to be created and have their performance be accurately and fairly measured. The dataset features various outdoor and indoor scenes of single and multiple moving objects.

The dataset includes training and test sequences captured from four different depth camera views and three 4K-stereo setups. The data are also time-synchronized with three Doppler radars to provide the magnitude of velocity ground truth.

However, naive label placement often results in clutter and occlusion impairing the effectiveness of AR visualization. For label placement, the main objectives to be satisfied are, non-occlusion to the scene of interest, the proximity of labels to the object, and, temporally coherent labels in a video/live feed. We present a novel method for the placement of labels corresponding to objects of interest in a video/live feed that satisfies the aforementioned objectives. Our proposed framework, SmartOverlays, first identifies the objects and generates corresponding labels using a YOLOv2 in a video frame; at the same time, Saliency Attention Model (SAM) learns eye fixation points that aid in predicting saliency maps; finally, computes Voronoi partitions of the video frame, choosing the centroids of objects as seed points, to place labels for satisfying the proximity constraints with the object of interest. In addition, our approach incorporates tracking the detected objects in a frame to facilitate temporal coherence between frames that enhances the readability of labels. We measure the effectiveness of SmartOverlays framework using three objective metrics: (a) Label Occlusion over Saliency (LOS), (b) temporal jitter metric to quantify jitter in the label placement, (c) computation time for label placement."}

In this context, we propose a novel conditional GAN architecture, namely ImaGINator, which given a single image, a condition (label of a facial expression or action) and noise, decomposes appearance and motion in both latent and high level feature spaces, generating realistic videos. This is achieved by (i)a novel spatio-temporal fusion scheme, which generates dynamic motion, while retaining appearance throughout the full video sequence by transmitting appearance (originating from the single image) through all layers of the network. In addition, we propose (ii) a novel transposed (1+2)D convolution, factorizing the transposed 3D convolutional filters into separate transposed temporal and spatial components, which yields significantly gains in video quality and speed. We extensively evaluate our approach on the facial expression datasets MUG and UvA-NEMO, as well as on the action datasets NATOPS and Weizmann.

While accuracy-wise CNNs provide unprecedented performance, they are also known to be computationally intensive and energy demanding for modern computer systems. In this paper, we propose Virtual Pooling (ViP), a model-level approach to improve speed and energy consumption of CNN-based image classification and object detection tasks, with a provable error bound. We show the efficacy of ViP through experiments on four CNN models, three representative datasets, both desktop and mobile platforms, and two visual learning tasks, i.e., image classification and object detection. For example, ViP delivers 2.1x speedup with less than 1.5% accuracy degradation in ImageNet classification on VGG16, and 1.8x speedup with 0.025 mAP degradation in PASCAL VOC object detection with Faster-RCNN. ViP also reduces mobile GPU and CPU energy consumption by up to 55% and  70%, respectively. As a complementary method to existing acceleration approaches, ViP achieves 1.9x speedup on ThiNet leading to a combined speedup of 5.23x on VGG16. Furthermore, ViP provides a knob for machine learning practitioners to generate a set of CNN models with varying trade-offs between system speed/energy consumption and accuracy to better accommodate the requirements of their tasks.

Matching customer search queries to plausible products is challenging due to the size and diversity of the catalogue. These challenges are compounded in apparel due to the semantic complexity and a large variation of fashion styles, product attributes and colours.  Providing aids that can help the customer visualise the styles and colours matching their \"search queries\" will provide customers with necessary intuition about what can be done next. This helps the customer buy a product with the styles, embellishments and colours of their liking. In this work, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating images from text streams like customer search queries. Our GAN learns to incrementally generate possible images complementing the fine-grained style, colour of the apparel in the query. We incorporate a novel colour modelling approach enabling the GAN to render a wide spectrum of colours accurately. We compile a dataset from an e-commerce website to train our model.

However, even though the tasks are highly varying, differing in complexity and difficulty, existing solutions mostly build on the same architectural decisions. This also applies to the selection of activation functions (AFs), where most approaches build on Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). In this paper, however, we show that the choice of a proper AF has a significant impact on the classification accuracy, in particular, if fine, subtle details are of relevance. Therefore, we propose to model the absence and the presence of features via the AF by using piece-wise AFs, which we refer to as L*ReLU. In this way, we can ensure the required properties, while still inheriting the benefits in terms of computational efficiency. We demonstrate our approach for the tasks of Fine-grained Visual Categorization (FGVC), running experiments on seven different benchmark datasets. The results do not only demonstrate superior results but also that for different tasks, having different characteristics, different AFs are selected."}

Also in this work the aim is to enhance the performance of a backbone CNN such as ResNet by including three efficient and lightweight components specifically designed for FGVC. This is achieved by using global k-max pooling, a discriminative embedding layer trained by optimizing class means and an efficient localization module that estimates bounding boxes using only class labels for training. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracies on multiple FGVC benchmark datasets."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2020", "Area": "CV", "Where": "WACV", "Abbreviation": "ScaIL", "Title": "Classifier Weights Scaling for Class Incremental Learning", "Abstract": "Incremental learning is useful if an AI agent needs to integrate data from a stream.  The problem is non trivial if the agent runs on a limited computational budget and has a bounded memory of past data. In a deep learning approach, the constant computational budget requires the use of a fixed architecture for all incremental states. The bounded memory generates imbalance in favor of new classes and a prediction bias toward them appears.  This bias is commonly countered by introducing a data balancing step in addition to the basic network training. We depart from this approach and propose simple but efficient scaling of past classifiers' weights to make them more comparable to those of new classes. Scaling exploits incremental state statistics and is applied to the classifiers learned in the initial state of classes to profit from all their available data.  We also question the utility of the widely used distillation loss component of incremental learning algorithms by comparing it to  vanilla fine tuning in presence of a bounded memory.  Evaluation is done against competitive baselines using four public datasets. Results show that the classifier weights scaling and the removal of the distillation are both beneficial."}

However, the way to efficiently model relations remains a problem. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), an effective method to handle structured data with relations, inspires us to leverage graphs in modeling relations for objection detection tasks. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Graph Assisted Reasoning (GAR), to utilize a heterogeneous graph in modeling object-object relations and object-scene relations. GAR fuses the features from neighboring object nodes as well as scene nodes and produces better recognition than that produced from individual object nodes. Moreover, compared to previous approaches using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), the light-weight and low-coupling architecture of GAR further facilitates its integration into the object detection module. Comprehensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate the efficacy of GAR."}

While two-stage approaches remain the state-of-the-art in object detection, anchor-free single-stage methods have been gaining momentum. We believe that the strength of the former is in their region of interest (ROI) pooling stage, while the latter simplifies the learning problem by converting object detection into dense per-pixel prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose to combine the strengths of each approach in a new architecture. In particular, we first define several auxiliary tasks related to object detection and generate dense per-pixel predictions using a shared feature extraction backbone. As a consequence of this architecture, the shared backbone is trained using both the standard object detection losses and these per-pixel ones. Moreover, by combining the features from dense predictions with those from the backbone, we realize a more discriminative representation for subsequent downstream processing. In addition, we feed the fused features into a novel multi-scale ROI pooling layer, followed by per-ROI predictions. We refer to our architecture as the Dense Auxiliary Tasks Network (DATNet). We present an extensive set of evaluations of our method on the Pascal VOC and COCO datasets and show considerable accuracy improvements over comparable baselines."}

These works mainly focus on generating spatially compact and well-defined categories of objects, such as birds or flowers, but meal images are significantly more complex, consisting of multiple ingredients whose appearance and spatial qualities are further modified by cooking methods. To generate real-like meal images from ingredients, we propose Cook Generative Adversarial Networks (CookGAN), CookGAN first builds an attention-based ingredients-image association model, which is then used to condition a generative neural network tasked with synthesizing meal images. Furthermore, a cycle-consistent constraint is added to further improve image quality and control appearance. Experiments show our model is able to generate meal images corresponding to the ingredients."}

However, most existing sign language datasets are limited to a small number of words. This makes the migration of recognition systems to real-life scenarios difficult. Due to the limited vocabulary size, models learned from those datasets cannot be applied in practice. In this paper, we introduce a new large-scale Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) video dataset, containing more than 2000 words performed by over 100 signers. This dataset will be made publicly available to the research community. To our knowledge, it is by far the largest public ASL dataset to facilitate word-level sign recognition research.   Based on this new large-scale dataset, we are able to experiment with several deep learning methods for word-level sign recognition and evaluate their performances in large scale scenarios. Specifically we implement and compare two different models,i.e., (i) holistic visual appearance based approach, and (ii) 2D human pose based approach. Both models are valuable baselines that will benefit the community for method benchmarking.  Moreover, we also propose a novel pose-based temporal graph convolution networks (Pose-TGCN) that model spatial and temporal dependencies in human pose trajectories simultaneously, which has further boosted the performance of the pose-based method.  Our results show that pose-based and appearance-based models achieve comparable performances up to 62.63% at top-10 accuracy on 2,000 words/glosses, demonstrating the validity and challenges of our dataset.

The key to successful visual-semantic embedding is to express visual and textual data properly by accounting for their intricate relationship. While previous studies have achieved much advance by encoding the visual and textual data into a joint space where similar concepts are closely located, they often represent data by a single vector ignoring the presence of multiple important components in an image or text. Thus, in addition to the joint embedding space, we propose a novel multi-head self-attention network to capture various components of visual and textual data by attending to important parts in data. Our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art results in image-text retrieval tasks on MS-COCO and Flicker30K datasets. Through the visualization of the attention maps that capture distinct semantic components at multiple positions in the image and the text, we demonstrate that our method achieves an effective and interpretable visual-semantic joint space."}

Consequently, proposed models for these datasets do not fully address the challenge of reasoning over plots. In particular, they assume that the answer comes either from a small fixed size vocabulary or from a bounding box within the image. However, in practice, this is an unrealistic assumption because many questions require reasoning and thus have real-valued answers which appear neither in a small fixed size vocabulary nor in the image. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap between existing datasets and real-world plots.  Specifically, we propose PlotQA with 28.9 million question-answer pairs over 224,377 plots on data from real-world sources and questions based on crowd-sourced question templates.  Further, 80.76% of the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) questions in PlotQA have answers that are not in a fixed vocabulary. Analysis of existing models on PlotQA reveals that they cannot deal with OOV questions:  their overall accuracy on our dataset is in single digits. This is not surprising given that these models were not designed for such questions. As a step towards a more holistic model which can address fixed vocabulary as well as OOV questions, we propose a hybrid approach: Specific questions are answered by choosing the answer from a fixed vocabulary or by extracting it from a predicted bounding box in the plot, while other questions are answered with a table question-answering engine which is fed with a structured table generated by detecting visual elements from the image. On the existing DVQA dataset, our model has an accuracy of 58%, significantly improving on the highest reported accuracy of 46%.  On PlotQA, our model has an accuracy of 22.52%, which is significantly better than state of the art models."}

Unlike convolution operators, self-attention offers infinite receptive field and enables compute-efficient modeling of global dependencies. However, the existing state-of-the-art attention mechanisms incur high compute and/or parameter overheads, and hence unfit for compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we propose a simple yet effective \"Ultra-Lightweight Subspace Attention Mechanism\" (ULSAM), which infers different attention maps for each feature map subspace. We argue that leaning separate attention maps for each feature subspace enables multi-scale and multi-frequency feature representation, which is more desirable for fine-grained  image classification. Our method of subspace attention is orthogonal and complementary to the existing state-of-the-arts attention mechanisms used in vision models. ULSAM is end-to-end trainable and can be deployed as a plug-and- play module in the pre-existing compact CNNs. Notably, our work is the first attempt that uses a subspace attention mechanism to increase the efficiency of compact CNNs. To show the efficacy of ULSAM, we perform experiments with MobileNet-V1 and MobileNet-V2 as backbone architectures on ImageNet-1K and three fine-grained image classification datasets. We achieve [?]13% and [?]25% reduction in both the FLOPs and parameter counts of MobileNet-V2 with a 0.27% and more than 1% improvement in top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K and fine-grained image classification datasets (respectively).

In noisy environments, the effect of audio modality is weakened, which further affects the performance of multi-modality speech recognition (MSR). Most of the MSR methods use noisy audio signal as input of the audio modality without any enhancement (filtering the noisy components in the audio signal). In this paper, we propose an audio-enhanced multi-modality speech recognition model. In particular, the proposed model consists of two sub-networks, one is the visual speech enhancement (VE) sub-network and the other is the multi-modality speech recognition (MSR) sub-network. The VE sub-network is able to separate a speaker's voice from background noises when given the corresponding talking face to enhance audio modality. Then the audio modality together with video modality are fed into the MSR sub-network to produce characters. We introduce a pseudo-3D residual network (P3D)-based visual front-end to extract more advantageous visual features. The MSR sub-network is built on top of the Element-wise-Attention Gated Recurrent Unit (EleAtt-GRU) architecture which is more effective than Transformer in long sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of audio enhancement for MSR by extensive experiments. The proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art MSR models on the LRS3-TED dataset and the LRW dataset."}

Some of the key challenges in pose estimation lie in obtaining labeled data and handling objects with symmetries. We explore both these problems of viewpoint estimation (object 3D orientation) by proposing a novel unsupervised training paradigm that only requires a 3D model of the object of interest. We show that we can successfully train an orientation detector, which simply consumes an RGB image, in an adversarial training framework, where the discriminator learns to provide a learning signal to retrieve the object orientation using a black-box non differentiable renderer. In order to overcome this non differentiability,  we introduce a randomized sampling method to obtain training gradients.  To our knowledge this is the first time an adversarial framework is employed to successfully train a viewpoint detector that can handle symmetric objects.Using this training framework we show state of the art results on 3D orientation prediction on T-LESS, a challenging dataset for texture-less and symmetric objects."}

We dub this problem amodal scene layout estimation, which involves hallucinating scene layout for even parts of the world that are occluded in the image. To this end, we present MonoLayout, a deep neural network for real- time amodal scene layout estimation from a single image. We represent scene layout as a multi-channel semantic occupancy grid, and leverage adversarial feature learning to \"hallucinate\" plausible completions for occluded image parts. We extend several state-of-the-art approaches for road-layout estimation and vehicle occupancy estimation in bird's eye view to the amodal setup and thoroughly evaluate against them.

To augment existing manual patrolling efforts, unmanned aerial surveillance using visible and thermal infrared (TIR) cameras is increasingly being adopted. Automated data acquisition has become easier with advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and sensors like TIR cameras, which allow surveillance at night when poaching typically occurs. However, it is still a challenge to accurately and quickly process large amounts of the resulting TIR data. In this paper, we present the first large dataset collected using a TIR camera mounted on a fixed-wing UAV in multiple African protected areas. This dataset includes TIR videos of humans and animals with several challenging scenarios like scale variations, background clutter due to thermal reflections, large camera rotations, and motion blur. Additionally, we provide another dataset with videos synthetically generated with the publicly available Microsoft AirSim simulation platform using a 3D model of an African savanna and a TIR camera model. Through our benchmarking experiments on state-of-the-art detectors, we demonstrate that leveraging the synthetic data in a domain adaptive setting can significantly improve detection performance. We also evaluate various recent approaches for single and multi-object tracking.

We evaluate our method using two sources of labels (OpenStreetMap, and those from the SpaceNet dataset), and find that models both trained and tested on SpaceNet labels outperform OpenStreetMap labels by greater than 60%. We quantify the performance of our algorithm with the Average Path Length Similarity (APLS) and map topology (TOPO) graph-theoretic metrics over a diverse test area covering four cities in the SpaceNet dataset. For a traditional edge weight of geometric distance, we find an aggregate of 5% improvement over existing methods for SpaceNet data. We also test our algorithm on Google satellite imagery with OpenStreetMap labels, and find a 23% improvement over previous work. Metric scores decrease by only 4% on large graphs when using travel time rather than geometric distance for edge weights, indicating that optimizing routing for travel time is feasible with this approach."}

Unfortunately, developing a dataset that captures even a small fraction of real-world variability is typically infeasible due to the cost of imagery, and manual pixel-wise labeling of the imagery.  In this work we develop an approach to rapidly and cheaply generate large and diverse synthetic overhead imagery for training segmentation CNNs.  Using this approach, we generate and publicly-release a collection of synthetic overhead imagery, termed Synthinel-1, with full pixel-wise building labels.  We use several benchmark datasets to demonstrate that Synthinel-1 is consistently beneficial when used to augment real-world training imagery, especially when CNNs are tested on novel geographic locations or conditions."}

This could be attributed to limited training data and large distribution gap in train and test domain datasets. In this paper, we propose a multi-level self-supervised learning model for domain adaptation of semantic segmentation. Exploiting the idea that an object (and most of stuff given context) should be labeled consistently regardless of its location, we generate spatially independent and semantically consistent (SISC) pseudo-labels by segmenting multiple sub-images using base model and designing an aggregation strategy. Image level pseudo weak-labels, PWL, are computed to guide domain adaptation by capturing global context similarity in source and target domain at latent space level. Thus helping latent space learn the representation even when there are very few pixels belonging to the domain category (small object for example) compared to rest of the image. Our multi-level Self-supervised learning (MLSL) outperforms existing state-of-art (self or adversarial learning) algorithms. Specifically, keeping all setting similar and employing MLSL we obtain a mIoU gain of 5.1% on GTA-V to Cityscapes adaptation and 4.3% on SYNTHIA to Cityscapes adaptation compared to the existing state-of-art method"}

Utilizing the dense native range representation of a LiDAR sensor and the setup calibration, we establish point correspondences between the two input modalities. Subsequently, we are able to warp and fuse the features from one domain into the other. Therefore, we can jointly exploit information from both data sources within one single network.  To show the merit of our method, we extend SqueezeSeg, a point cloud segmentation network, with an RGB feature branch and fuse it into the original structure. Our extension called FuseSeg leads to an improvement of up to 18% IoU on the KITTI benchmark. In addition to the improved accuracy, we also achieve real-time performance at 50 fps, five times as fast as the KITTI LiDAR data recording speed."}

We exploit multiview geometric constraints to avoid such shortcomings. To handle the nonrigid background like a sea, we also propose a robust fusion mechanism between motion and appearance-based features. We find dense trajectories, covering every pixel in the video, and propose trajectory-based epipolar distances to distinguish between background and foreground regions. Trajectory epipolar distances are data-independent and can be readily computed given a few features' correspondences between the images. We show that by combining epipolar distances with optical flow, a powerful motion network can be learned. Enabling the network to leverage both of these features, we propose a simple mechanism, we call input-dropout. Comparing the motion-only networks, we outperform the previous state of the art on DAVIS-2016 dataset by 5.2% in the mean IoU score. By robustly fusing our motion network with an appearance network using the input-dropout mechanism, we also outperform the previous methods on DAVIS-2016, 2017 and Segtrackv2 dataset."}

However, heavily relying on the first frame may weaken the robustness for VOS, since video objects can show large variations through time. In this work, we propose a Dynamic Identity Propagation Network (DIPNet) that adaptively propagates and accurately segments the video objects over time. To achieve this, DIPNet disentangles the VOS task at each time step into a dynamic propagation phase and a spatial segmentation phase. The former utilizes a novel identity representation to adaptively propagate objects' reference information over time, which enhances the robustness to video objects' temporal variations. The latter uses the propagated information to tackle the object segmentation as an easier static image problem that can be optimized via slight fine-tuning on the first frame, thus reducing the computational cost.  As a result, by optimizing these two components to complement each other, we can achieve a robust system for VOS. Evaluations on four benchmark datasets show that DIPNet provides state-of-the-art performance with time efficiency."}

Recent approaches to 3D shape segmentation learning heavily rely on high-quality labeled training datasets. This limits their use in applications to handle the large scale unannotated datasets. In this paper, we proposed a novel semi-supervised approach, named Robust Learning of One-Shot 3D Shape Segmentation (ROSS), which only requires one single exemplar labeled shape for training. The proposed ROSS can generalize its ability from a one-shot training process to predict the segmentation for previously unseen 3D shape models. The proposed ROSS is composed of three major modules for 3D shape segmentation as follows. The global shape descriptor generator is the first module that utilizes the proposed reference weighted convolution to learn a 3D shape descriptor. The second module is a part-aware shape descriptor constructor that can generate weighted descriptors from a learned 3D shape descriptor according to semantic parts without supervision. The shape morphing with label transferring works as the last module. It morphs the exemplar shape and then transfers labels from the transformed exemplar shape to the target shape. The extensive experimental results on 3D mesh datasets demonstrate the ROSS is robust to noise and incomplete shapes and it can be applied to unannotated datasets. The experiment shows the proposed ROSS can achieve comparable performance with the supervised method."}

Towards solving this task, we present UnOVOST (Unsupervised Offline Video Object Segmentation and Tracking) as a simple and generic algorithm which is able to track and segment a large variety of objects. This algorithm builds up tracks in a number stages, first grouping segments into short tracklets that are spatio-temporally consistent, before merging these tracklets into long-term consistent object tracks based on their visual similarity. In order to achieve this we introduce a novel tracklet-based Forest Path Cutting data association algorithm which builds up a decision forest of track hypotheses before cutting this forest into paths that form long-term consistent object tracks. When evaluating our approach on the DAVIS 2017 Unsupervised dataset we obtain state-of-the-art performance with a mean J &F score of 67.9% on the val, 58% on the test-dev and 56.4% on the test-challenge benchmarks, obtaining first place in the DAVIS 2019 Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

In this paper, we present Quadtree Generating Networks (QGNs), a novel approach able to drastically reduce the memory footprint of modern semantic segmentation networks. The key idea is to use quadtrees to represent the predictions and target segmentation masks instead of dense pixel grids. Our quadtree representation enables hierarchical processing of an input image, with the most computationally demanding layers only being used at regions in the image containing boundaries between classes. In addition, given a trained model, our representation enables flexible inference schemes to trade-off accuracy and computational cost, allowing the network to adapt in constrained situations such as embedded devices. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the Cityscapes, SUN-RGBD and ADE20k datasets. On Cityscapes, we obtain an relative 3% mIoU improvement compared to a dilated network with similar memory consumption; and only receive a 3% relative mIoU drop compared to a large dilated network, while reducing memory consumption by over 4x.

Most of the available approaches employ generic image parsing architectures designed for segmentation of object focused scene captured in indoor setups. However, images captured in car-mounted cameras exhibit an extreme effect of perspective geometry, causing a significant scale disparity between near and farther objects. Recognizing this, we formalize a unique Variable Resolution Transform (VRT) technique motivated from the foveal magnification in human eye. Following this, we design a Fovea Estimation Network (FEN) which is trained to estimate a single most convenient fixation location along with the associated magnification factor, best suited for a given input image. The proposed framework is designed to enable its usage as a wrapper over the available real-time scene parsing models, thereby demonstrating a superior trade-off between speed and quality as compared to the prior state-of-the-arts."}

Then the matching module with deformable convolution layers matches pixels between reference and target frames based on the embedding features. Unlike previous supervised methods using deformable convolution, our matching module adopts deformable convolution to focus on similar features in spatiotemporally neighboring pixels. We further propose an online updating module to refine the segmentation result by transferring knowledge from the given first frame.

However, the problem has been considered as a subset of the object segmentation and less handled in this field. Obviously, portrait segmentation has its unique requirements. First, because the portrait segmentation is performed in the middle of a whole process, it requires extremely lightweight models. Second, there has not been any public datasets in this domain that contain a sufficient number of images. To solve the first problem, we introduce the new extremely lightweight portrait segmentation model SINet, containing an information blocking decoder and spatial squeeze modules. The information blocking decoder uses confidence estimation to recover local spatial information without spoiling global consistency. The spatial squeeze module uses multiple receptive fields to cope with various sizes of consistency. To tackle the second problem, we propose a simple method to create additional portrait segmentation data, which can improve accuracy. In our qualitative and quantitative analysis on the EG1800 dataset, we show that our method outperforms various existing lightweight models. Our method reduces the number of parameters from 2:1M to 86:9K (around 95.9% reduction), while maintaining the accuracy under an 1% margin from the state-of-the-art method. We also show our model is successfully executed on a real mobile device with 100.6 FPS. In addition, we demonstrate that our method can be used for general semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset.

Self-supervised learning is another technique that learns semantically meaningful features, using only the inherent structure of the data. This work investigates the role of learning relevant feature manifold for few-shot tasks using self-supervision and regularization techniques. We observe that regularizing the feature manifold, enriched via self-supervised techniques, with Manifold Mixup significantly improves few-shot learning performance.  We show that our proposed method S2M2 beats the current state-of-the-art accuracy on standard few-shot learning datasets like CIFAR-FS, CUB, mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet by 3-8 %.

Public open spaces (POS), such as parks, plazas and greenways, are key environments that encourage those activities. To evaluate a POS, there is a need to study how humans use the facilities within it. However, traditional approaches to studying use of POS are manual and therefore time and labor intensive. They also may only provide qualitative insights. It is appealing to make use of surveillance cameras and to extract user-related information through computer vision. This paper proposes a proof-of-concept deep learning computer vision framework for measuring human activities quantitatively in POS and demonstrates a case study of the proposed framework using the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy (DRFC) surveillance camera network. A custom image dataset is presented to train the framework; the dataset includes 7826 fully annotated images collected from 18 cameras across the DRFC park space under various illumination conditions.

We focus on pedestrian-vehicle interactions because of the high risk of harm to the pedestrian if their actions are miss-predicted.  Our end-to-end model consists of two stages: the first stage is an encoder-decoder network that learns to predict future video frames. The second stage is a deep spatio-temporal network that utilizes the predicted frames of the first stage to predict the pedestrian's future action.

With the increasing need to transfer large amounts of images with limited bandwidth, compressing images to very low sizes is a crucial task. However, the existing methods are not effective at extremely low bitrates. To address this need we propose a novel network called CompressNet which augments a Stacked Autoencoder with a Switch Prediction Network (SAE-SPN). This helps in the reconstruction of visually pleasing images at these low bitrates (< 0.1 bpp). We benchmark the performance of our proposed method on the Cityscapes dataset, evaluating over different metrics at very low bitrates showing that our method outperforms the other state-of-the-art.

It is a challenging task because the blur due to camera shake, object movement and defocusing is heterogeneous in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Traditional methods train on datasets synthesized with a single level of blur, and thus do not generalize well across levels of blurriness. To address this challenge, we propose a dual attention mechanism to dynamically aggregate temporal cues for deblurring with an end-to-end trainable network structure. Specifically, an internal attention module adaptively selects the optimal temporal scales for restoring the sharp center frame. An external attention module adaptively aggregates and refines multiple sharp frame estimates, from several internal attention modules designed for different blur levels. To train and evaluate on more diverse blur severity levels, we propose a Challenging DVD dataset generated from the raw DVD video set by pooling frames with different temporal windows. Our framework achieves consistently better performance on this more challenging dataset while obtaining strongly competitive results on the original DVD benchmark. Extensive ablative studies and qualitative visualizations further demonstrate the advantage of our method in handling real video blur."}

While many learning-based algorithms have been proposed to detect such attacks, very few are equipped to handle previously unseen or newly constructed PAs. In this research, we propose a presentation attack detection (PAD) method that utilizes a  discriminator that is trained to distinguish between bonafide iris images and synthetically generated iris images.  We hypothesize that such a discriminator will generate a tight boundary around the bonafide samples. This would allow the discriminator to better separate the bonafide samples from all types of PA samples. For generating synthetic irides, we train the Relativistic Average Standard Generative Adversarial Network (RaSGAN) that has been shown to generate higher resolution and better quality images than standard GANs. The relativistic discriminator (RD) component of the trained RaSGAN is then appropriated for PA detection and is referred to as RD-PAD. Experimental results convey the efficacy of the RD-PAD as a one-class anomaly detector."}

The extent of vulnerability has been explored intensively in cases of l_p-bounded and l_p-minimal adversarial perturbations.

In this paper, we study the smoothness of perturbations and propose SmoothFool, a general and computationally efficient framework for computing smooth adversarial perturbations. Through extensive experiments, we validate the efficacy of the proposed method for both the white-box and black-box attack scenarios. In particular, we demonstrate that: (i) there exist extremely smooth adversarial perturbations for well-established and widely used network architectures, (ii) smoothness significantly enhances the robustness of perturbations against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, (iii) smoothness improves the transferability of adversarial perturbations across both data points and network architectures, and (iv) class categories exhibit a variable range of susceptibility to smooth perturbations.

Even though some cross-spectral datasets were presented in the past, they were acquired in a constrained setup, which limited the performance of methods for the aforementioned problems under a cross-spectral setting. This work introduces a new dataset, named EDGE20, that can be used in addressing the problems of pedestrian detection, face detection, and face recognition in images captured using trail cameras under the VIS and NIR spectra. Data acquisition was performed in an outdoor environment, during both day and night, under unconstrained acquisition conditions. The collection of images is accompanied by a rich set of annotations, consisting of person and facial bounding boxes, unique subject identifiers, and labels that characterize facial images as frontal, profile, or back faces. Moreover, the performance of several state-of-the-art methods was evaluated for each of the scenarios covered by our dataset.

Despite their impressive results, it is known that there are two problems with the approach. First, the multi-resolution estimation of optical flow fails in situations where small objects move fast. Second, warping creates artifacts when occlusion or dis-occlusion happens. In this paper, we propose a new neural network module, Deformable Cost Volume, which alleviates the two problems. Based on this module, we designed the Deformable Volume Network (Devon) which can estimate multi-scale optical flow in a single high resolution. Experiments show Devon is more suitable in handling small objects moving fast and achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art methods in public benchmarks."}

The existing methods for moving object detection (MOD) only computes class-agnostic pixel-wise binary segmentation of video frames. On the other hand, the object detection techniques do not differentiate between static and moving objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first attempt for simultaneous localization and classification of moving objects in a video, i.e. MOR in a single-stage deep learning framework. We achieve this by labelling axis-aligned bounding boxes for moving objects which requires less computational resources than producing pixel-level estimates. In the proposed MotionRec, both temporal and spatial features are learned using past history and current frames respectively. First, the background is estimated with a temporal depth reductionist (TDR) block. Then the estimated background, current frame and temporal median of recent observations are assimilated to encode spatiotemporal motion saliency. Moreover, feature pyramids are generated from these motion saliency maps to perform regression and classification at multiple levels of feature abstractions. MotionRec works online at inference as it requires only few past frames for MOR. Moreover, it doesn't require predefined target initialization from user. We also annotated axis-aligned bounding boxes (42,614 objects (14,814 cars and 27,800 person) in 24,923 video frames of CDnet 2014 dataset) due to lack of available benchmark datasets for MOR. The performance is observed qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of mAP over a defined unseen test set. Experiments show that the proposed MotionRec significantly improves over strong baselines with RetinaNet architectures for MOR."}

Existing methods entangle the two intrinsically different tasks of motion and content creation in a single generator network, but this approach struggles to simultaneously generate plausible motion and content. To im-prove motion modeling in video generation tasks, we propose a two-stream model that disentangles motion generation from content generation, called a Two-Stream Variational Adversarial Network (TwoStreamVAN). Given an action label and a noise vector, our model is able to create clear and consistent motion, and thus yields photorealistic videos. The key idea is to progressively generate and fuse multi-scale motion with its corresponding spatial content. Our model significantly outperforms existing methods on the standard Weizmann Human Action, MUG Facial Expression, and VoxCeleb datasets, as well as our new dataset of diverse human actions with challenging and complex motion. Our code is available at https://github.com/sunxm2357/TwoStreamVAN/."}

The static scene assumption, however, limits the general applicability of MVS algorithms, as many day-to-day scenes undergo non-rigid motion, e.g., clothes, faces, or human bodies. In this paper, we open up a new challenging direction: Dense 3D reconstruction of scenes with non-rigid changes observed from a small number of images sparsely captured from different views with a single monocular camera, which we call non-rigid multi-view stereo (NRMVS) problem. We formulate this problem as a joint optimization of deformation and depth estimation, using deformation graphs as the underlying representation. We propose a new sparse 3D to 2D matching technique with a dense patch-match evaluation scheme to estimate the most plausible deformation field satisfying depth and photometric consistency. We show that a dense reconstruction of a scene with non-rigid changes from a few images is possible, and demonstrate that our method can be used to interpolate novel deformed scenes from various combinations of deformation estimates derived from the sparse views."}

Crucially, their success relies upon the availability of some annotated frames of the test video during training. Consequently, their performance on completely \"unseen\" videos is undocumented in the literature. In this work, we propose a new, supervised, background-subtraction algorithm for unseen videos (BSUV-Net) based on a fully-convolutional neural network. The input to our network consists of the current frame and two background frames captured at different time scales along with their semantic segmentation maps. In order to reduce the chance of overfitting, we also introduce a new data-augmentation technique which mitigates the impact of illumination difference between the background frames and the current frame. On the CDNet-2014 dataset, BSUV-Net outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on unseen videos in terms of several metrics including F-measure, recall and precision."}

The pipeline directly operates on raw point clouds extracted from RGB-D scans. Specifically, our method takes the point cloud as input and regresses the point-wise unit vectors pointing to the 3D keypoints. We then use these vectors to generate keypoint hypotheses from which the 6D object pose hypotheses are computed. Finally, we select the best 6D object pose from the hypotheses based on a proposed scoring mechanism with geometry constraints. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method is robust against the variety in object shape and appearance as well as occlusions between objects, and that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the LINEMOD and Occlusion LINEMOD datasets."}

Compared to traditional feature and decision fusion approaches that neglect the fact that features can interact and exchange information, the proposed GNN is able to pass information among features extracted from different models. Two image understanding tasks, namely group-level emotion recognition (GER) and event recognition, which are highly semantic and require the interaction of several deep models to synthesize multiple cues, were selected to validate the performance of the proposed method.

In this work, we study the problem of semantic segmentation model in adapting to such hot climate cities. This issue can be circumvented by collecting and annotating images in such weather conditions and training segmentation models on those images. But the task of semantically annotating images for every environment is painstaking and expensive.  Hence, we propose a framework that improves the performance of semantic segmentation models without explicitly creating an annotated dataset for such adverse weather variations. Our framework consists of two parts, a restoration network to remove the geometrical distortions caused by hot weather and an adaptive segmentation network that is trained on an additional loss to adapt to the statistics of the ground-truth segmentation map. We train our framework on the Cityscapes dataset, which showed a total IoU gain of 12.707 over standard segmentation models. We also observe that the segmentation results obtained by our framework gave a significant improvement for small classes such as poles, person, and rider, which are essential and valuable for autonomous navigation based applications."}

The advent of each task often accompanies the release of a large-scale annotated dataset, for supervised training of deep network. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to manually label sufficient amount of training data. Therefore, it is important to develop algorithms that can leverage off-the-shelf labeled dataset to learn useful knowledge for the target task. While previous works mostly focus on transfer learning from a single source, we study multi-source transfer across domains and tasks (MS-DTT), in a semi-supervised setting. We propose GradMix, a model-agnostic method applicable to any model trained with gradient-based learning rule, to transfer knowledge via gradient descent by weighting and mixing the gradients from all sources during training. GradMix follows a meta-learning objective, which assigns layer-wise weights to the source gradients, such that the combined gradient follows the direction that minimize the loss for a small set of samples from the target dataset. In addition, we propose to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each mini-batch based on its importance to the target task, and a pseudo-labeling method to leverage the unlabeled samples in the target domain. We conduct MS-DTT experiments on two tasks: digit recognition and action recognition, and demonstrate the advantageous performance of the proposed method against multiple baselines."}

In particular, it was shown that a wide variety of image translation operators may be learned from two image sets, containing images from two different domains, without establishing an explicit pairing between the images. This was made possible by introducing clever regularizers to overcome the under-constrained nature of the unpaired translation problem. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture for unpaired image translation, and explore several new regularizers enabled by it. Specifically, our architecture comprises a pair of GANs, as well as a pair of translators between their respective latent spaces. These cross-translators enable us to impose several regularizing constraints on the learnt image translation operator, collectively referred to as latent cross-consistency. Our results show that our proposed architecture and latent cross-consistency constraints are able to outperform the existing state-of-the-art on a variety of image translation tasks."}

We gradually change each discriminator's task from distinguishing between real and fake samples to discriminating samples coming from inside or outside its assigned microbatch by using a diversity parameter \\alpha. The generator is then forced to promote variety in each minibatch to make the microbatch discrimination harder to achieve by each discriminator. Thus, all models in our framework benefit from having variety in the generated set to reduce their respective losses. We show evidence that our solution promotes sample diversity since early training stages on multiple datasets."}

Although natural image samples provide ideal examples of both valid structure and valid texture, learning to reproduce both together remains an open challenge. In our approach, we augment the training set of natural images with modified examples that have degraded structural consistency. These degraded examples are automatically created by randomly exchanging pairs of patches in an image's convolutional feature map. We call this approach feature exchange. With this setup, we propose a novel GAN formulation, termed Feature eXchange GAN (FX-GAN), in which the discriminator is trained not only to distinguish real versus generated images, but also to perform the auxiliary task of distinguishing between real images and structurally corrupted (feature-exchanged) real images. This auxiliary task causes the discriminator to learn the proper feature structure of natural images, which in turn guides the generator to produce images with more realistic structure. Compared with strong GAN baselines, our proposed self-supervision approach improves generated image quality, diversity, and training stability for both the unconditional and class-conditional settings."}

Thus, annotation methods are becoming more and more critical to collect data efficiently. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient Interactive Self-Annotation framework to cut down both time and human labor cost for video object bounding box annotation. Our method is based on recurrent self-supervised learning and consists of two processes: automatic process and interactive process, where the automatic process aims to build a supported detector to speed up the interactive process. In the Automatic Recurrent Annotation, we let an off-the-shelf detector watch unlabeled videos repeatedly to reinforce itself automatically. At each iteration, we utilize the trained model from the previous iteration to generate better pseudo ground-truth bounding boxes than those at the previous iteration, recurrently improving self-supervised training the detector. In the Interactive Recurrent Annotation, we tackle the human-in-the-loop annotation scenario where the detector receives feedback from the human annotator. To this end, we propose a novel Hierarchical Correction module, where the annotated frame-distance binarizedly decreases at each time step, to utilize the strength of CNN for neighbor frames. Experimental results on various video datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework in generating high-quality annotations while reducing annotation time and human labor costs."}

In this paper, we consider a task: given a reference garment image A and another image B with target attribute (collar/sleeve), generate a photo-realistic image which combines the texture from reference A and the new attribute from reference B. The highly convoluted attributes and the lack of paired data are the main challenges to the task. To overcome those limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised model to synthesize garment images with disentangled attributes (e.g., collar and sleeves) without paired data. Our method consists of reconstruction learning step and adversarial learning step. The model learns texture and location information through reconstruction learning. And the model capability is generalized to achieve single-attribute manipulation by adversarial learning. Meanwhile, we compose a new dataset, named GarmentSet, with annotation of landmarks of collar and sleeves on clean garment images. Thoughtful experiments on this dataset and real-world samples demonstrate that our method can synthesize significantly better results than the state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons.

The contribution of this work is three-fold. First, we propose a deep network for the problem of style-augmented SBIR (or s-SBIR) having three main components - category module, style module and mixer module, which are trained in an end-to-end manner. Second, we propose a quintuplet loss, which takes into consideration both the category and style, while giving appropriate importance to the two components. Third, we propose a composite evaluation metric or ncMAP which can quantitatively evaluate s-SBIR approaches. Extensive experiments on subsets of two benchmark image-sketch datasets, Sketchy and TU-Berlin show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

The stylization is achieved by manipulating the content representations and Gram-based style representations extracted from a pre-trained PointNet-based classification network for colored point clouds.  As Gram-based style representation is invariant to the number or the order of points, the style can also be an image in the case of stylizing the color property of a point cloud by merely treating the image as a set of pixels.  Experimental results and analysis demonstrate the capability of the proposed method for stylizing a point cloud either from another point cloud or an image."}

Our method is designed to learn from a traditional animation, where each frame is drawn by an artist, and thus the input images lack any common structure, correspondences, or labels. We express pose changes as a deformation of a layered 2.5D template mesh, and devise a novel architecture that learns to predict mesh deformations matching the template to a target image. This enables us to extract a common low-dimensional structure in the diverse set of character poses. We combine recent advances in differentiable rendering as well as mesh-aware models to successfully align common template even if only a few character images are available during training. In addition to coarse poses, character appearance also varies due to shading, out-of-plane motions, and artistic effects. We capture these subtle changes by applying an image translation network to refine the mesh rendering, providing an end-to-end model to generate new animations of a character with high visual quality. We demonstrate that our generative model can be used to synthesize in-between frames and to create data-driven deformation. Our template fitting procedure outperforms state-of-the-art generic techniques for detecting image correspondences."}

Marker-less human motion estimation and shape modeling from images in the wild bring this challenge to the fore. Although the recent advances on view synthesis and image-to-image translation, currently available formulations are limited to transfer solely style and do not take into account the character's motion and shape, which are by nature intermingled to produce plausible human forms. In this paper, we propose a unifying formulation for transferring appearance and retargeting human motion from monocular videos that regards all these aspects. Our method synthesizes new videos of people in a different context where they were initially recorded. Differently from recent appearance transferring methods, our approach takes into account body shape, appearance, and motion constraints. The evaluation is performed with several experiments using publicly available real videos containing hard conditions. Our method is able to transfer both human motion and appearance outperforming state-of-the-art methods, while preserving specific features of the motion that must be maintained (e.g., feet touching the floor, hands touching a particular object) and holding the best visual quality and appearance metrics such as Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)"}

The animation is driven by human interpretable control signals consisting of head pose angles and the Action Unit (AU) values. The control information can be obtained from multiple sources including external driving videos and manual controls. Due to the interpretable nature of the driving signal, one can easily mix the information between multiple sources (e.g. pose from one image and expression from another) and apply selective post- production editing. The proposed face animator is implemented as a two-stage neural network model that is learned in a self-supervised manner using a large video collection. The proposed Interpretable and Controllable face reenactment network (ICface) is compared to the state-of-the-art neural network-based face animation techniques in multiple tasks. The results indicate that ICface produces better visual quality while being more versatile than most of the comparison methods.

Thus, we excluded any manual video annotation. Furthermore, our designed approach even do not rely on any video segmentation.

To improve the performance of our sequence-to-sequence transformer, soft non-monotonic attention was employed in our training process. A benefit of character-level features was compared with word-level features. Besides a novel approach to sign language synthesis, we also present a gradient-descend-based method for the skeletal model estimation improvement. This improvement not only smooths skeletal models and interpolates missing bones but it also creates 3D skeletal models from 2D models.

However, training a binary network from scratch with separable depth-wise and point-wise convolutions in case of MobileNet is not trivial and prone to divergence. To tackle this training issue, we propose a novel neural network architecture, namely MoBiNet - Mobile Binary Network in which skip connections are manipulated to prevent information loss and vanishing gradient, thus facilitate the training process. More importantly, while existing binary neural networks often make use of cumbersome backbones such as Alex-Net, ResNet, VGG-16 with float-type pre-trained weights initialization, our MoBiNet focuses on binarizing the already-compressed neural networks like MobileNet without the need of a pre-trained model to start with. Therefore, our proposal results in an effectively small model while keeping the accuracy comparable to existing ones. Experiments on ImageNet dataset show the potential of the MoBiNet as it achieves 54.40% top-1 accuracy and dramatically reduces the computational cost with binary operators."}

This paper explores the preservation of such back-of-the-napkin ideas. Hand-sketched notes, reflecting those flashes of inspiration, are not limited to text; they can also include drawings and graphics. Napkin backgrounds typically exhibit diverse textural and colour motifs/patterns that may have high visual saliency from a low-level vision standpoint. We thus frame the extraction of hand-sketched notes as a background modelling and removal task. We propose a novel document background model based on texture mixtures constructed from the document itself via texture synthesis, which allows us to identify background pixels and extract hand-sketched data as foreground elements. Experiments on a novel napkin image dataset yield excellent results and showcase the robustness of our method with respect to the napkin contents. A texture-based background modelling approach, such as ours, is generic enough to cope with any type of hand-sketched notes."}

Even today, there are still many scanned documents and mail that come into businesses in non-digital format. Text to be extracted from real world documents is often nestled inside rich formatting, such as tabular structures or forms with fill-in-the-blank boxes or underlines whose ink often touches or even strikes through the ink of the text itself. Further, the text region could have random ink smudges or spurious strokes. Such ink artifacts can severely interfere with the performance of recognition algorithms or other downstream processing tasks. In this work, we propose DeepErase, a neural-based preprocessor to erase ink artifacts from text images. We devise a method to programmatically assemble real text images and real artifacts into realistic-looking \"dirty\" text images, and use them to train an artifact segmentation network in a weakly supervised manner, since pixel-level annotations are automatically obtained during the assembly process. In addition to high segmentation accuracy, we show that our cleansed images achieve a significant boost in recognition accuracy by popular OCR software such as Tesseract 4.0. Finally, we test DeepErase on out-of-distribution datasets (NIST SDB) of scanned IRS tax return forms and achieve double-digit improvements in accuracy.

Popular registration tools such as ANTs and NiftyReg optimize an objective function for each pair of images from scratch which is time-consuming for large images with complicated deformation. Facilitated by the rapid progress of deep learning, learning-based approaches such as VoxelMorph have been emerging for image registration. These approaches can achieve competitive performance in a fraction of a second on advanced GPUs. In this work, we construct a neural registration framework, called NeurReg, with a hybrid loss of displacement fields and data similarity, which substantially improves the current state-of-the-art of registrations. Within the framework, we simulate various transformations by a registration simulator which generates fixed image and displacement field ground truth for training. Furthermore, we design three segmentation frameworks based on the proposed registration framework: 1) atlas-based segmentation, 2) joint learning of both segmentation and registration tasks, and 3) multi-task learning with atlas-based segmentation as an intermediate feature. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed NeurReg framework based on various metrics: the endpoint error (EPE) of the predicted displacement field, mean square error (MSE), normalized local cross-correlation (NLCC), mutual information (MI), Dice coefficient, uncertainty estimation, and the interpretability of the segmentation. The proposed NeurReg improves registration accuracy with fast inference speed, which can greatly accelerate related medical image analysis tasks."}

Instead of explicitly segmenting object instances, we show that directly learning histograms of object sizes improves accuracy while using drastically less parameters. This is very useful for application scenarios where explicit, pixel-accurate instance segmentation is not needed, but their lies interest in the overall distribution of instance sizes. Our core applications are in biology, where we estimate the size distribution of soldier fly larvae, and medicine, where we estimate the size distribution of cancer cells as an intermediate step to calculate tumor cellularity score. Given an image with hundreds of small object instances, we output the total count and the size histogram.  We also provide a new data set for this task, the FlyLarvae data set, which consists of 11,000 larvae instances labeled pixel-wise. Our method results in an overall improvement in the count and size distribution prediction as compared to state-of-the-art instance segmentation method Mask R-CNN."}

To further improve the performance of vessel segmentation, we propose IterNet, a new model based on UNet, with the ability to find obscured details of the vessel from the segmented vessel image itself, rather than the raw input image. IterNet consists of multiple iterations of a mini-UNet, which can be 4X deeper than the common UNet. IterNet also adopts the weight-sharing and skip-connection features to facilitate training; therefore, even with such a large architecture, IterNet can still learn from merely 10 20 labeled images, without pre-training or any prior knowledge. IterNet achieves AUCs of 0.9816, 0.9851, and 0.9881 on three mainstream datasets, namely DRIVE, CHASE-DB1, and STARE, respectively, which currently are the best scores in the literature.

Providing an ability to be able to predict whether something will be humorous to the audience is also crucial. In this project, we aim to automate this task. Towards doing so, we annotate an existing sitcom (`Big Bang Theory') and use the laughter cues present to obtain a manual annotation for this show. We provide detailed analysis for the dataset design and further evaluate various state of the art baselines for solving this task. We observe that existing LSTM and BERT based networks on the text alone do not perform as well as joint text and video or only video-based networks. Moreover, it is challenging to ascertain that the words attended to while predicting laughter are indeed humorous. Our dataset and analysis provided through this paper is a valuable resource towards solving this interesting semantic and practical task. As an additional contribution, we have developed a novel model for solving this task that is a multi-modal self-attention based model that outperforms currently prevalent models for solving this task.

In these studies, different persons are usually treated as independent pose instances to estimate. However, in many every-day situations, people are interacting, and the pose of an individual depends on the pose of his/her interactees. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit these dependency to enhance current, and possibly future, deep networks for 3D monocular pose estimation. Our pose interacting network, or PI-Net, inputs the initial pose estimates of a variable number of interactees into a recurrent network used to refine the pose of the person-of-interest. Evaluating such a method is challenging due to the limited availability of public annotated multi-person 3D human pose datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the MuPoTS dataset, setting the new state-of-the-art on it. Qualitative results on other multi-person datasets (for which 3D pose ground-truth is not available) showcase the proposed PI-Net."}

For practical reasons, 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) are usually trained with relatively short clips randomly extracted from videos. However, such uniform sampling is generally sub-optimal because equal importance is assigned to each temporal clip. In this paper, we present a strategy for efficient video-based training of 3D CNNs. It relies on softmax temporal pooling and a weighted sampling mechanism to select the most relevant training clips. The proposed softmax strategy provides several advantages - a reduced computational complexity due to efficient clip sampling, and an improved accuracy since temporal weighting focuses on more relevant clips during both training and inference. Experimental results obtained with the proposed method on several facial expression recognition benchmarks show the benefits of focusing on more informative clips in training videos. In particular, our approach improves performance and computational cost by reducing the impact of inaccurate trimming and coarse annotation of videos, and heterogeneous distribution of visual information across time."}

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been proven to be an effective approach to solve the problem of domain shift by leveraging both data from the scenario that the model was trained on (source) and the new scenario (target). Although the source data are available for training the source model, there is no guarantee that the source data will still be available when applying UDA in the future due to emerging regulations on privacy of data. This results in the in-applicability of most existing UDA methods in the absence of source data. This paper proposes a source-data-free feature alignment (SoFA) method to address this problem by only using the trained source model and unlabeled target data. The source model is used to predict the labels for target data, and we model the generation process from predicted classes to input data to infer the latent features for alignment. Specifically, a mixture of Gaussian distributions is induced from the predicted classes as the reference distribution. The encoded target features are then aligned to the reference distribution via variational inference to extract class semantics without accessing source data. Relationship of the proposed method and the theory of domain adaptation is provided to verify the performance. Experimental results show the proposed method achieves higher or comparable accuracy compared to the existing methods in several cross-dataset classification tasks. Ablation studies are also conducted to confirm the importance of latent feature alignment to adaptation performance."}

However, very large amounts of labeled data are usually needed to train deep neural networks. Several semi-supervised learning approaches have been proposed to train neural networks using smaller amounts of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. The performance of these semi-supervised methods significantly degrades as the size of labeled data decreases. We introduce Mutual-information-based Unsupervised & Semi-supervised Concurrent LEarning (MUSCLE), a hybrid learning approach that uses mutual information to combine both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. MUSCLE can be used as a stand-alone training scheme for neural networks, and can also be incorporated into other learning approaches. We show that the proposed hybrid model outperforms state of the art on several standard benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Mini-Imagenet. Furthermore, the performance gain consistently increases with the reduction in the amount of labeled data, as well as in the presence of bias. We also show that MUSCLE has the potential to boost the classification performance when used in the fine-tuning phase for a model pre-trained only on unlabeled data."}

We use the semantic relatedness of text embeddings as a means for zero-shot learning by aligning audio and video embeddings with the corresponding class label text feature space. Our approach uses a cross-modal decoder and a composite triplet loss. The cross-modal decoder enforces a constraint that the class label text features can be reconstructed from the audio and video embeddings of data points. This helps the audio and video embeddings to move closer to the class label text embedding. The composite triplet loss makes use of the audio, video, and text embeddings. It helps bring the embeddings from the same class closer and push away the embeddings from different classes in a multi-modal setting. This helps the network to perform better on the multi-modal zero-shot learning task. Importantly, our multi-modal zero-shot learning approach works even if a modality is missing at test time. We test our approach on the generalized zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks and show that our approach outperforms other models in the presence of a single modality as well as in the presence of multiple modalities. We validate our approach by comparing it with previous approaches and using various ablations."}

One important problem is the reliable control of the manufacturing process by inferring the printed 3D glass shape from its caustic image. Towards this goal, we propose a novel general-purpose reconstruction algorithm based on differentiable light propagation simulation followed by a regularization scheme that takes the deposited glass volume into account. This enables incorporating arbitrary measurements of caustics into an efficient reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and establish the influence of our hyperparameters using several sample shapes and parameter configurations."}

We propose a general pipeline of enhancing visual explanations using image transformations (EVET). EVET considers transformations of the original input image to refine the critical input region based on an intuitive rationale that the region estimated to be important in variously transformed inputs is more important. Our proposed EVET is applicable to existing visual explanation methods without modification. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method qualitatively and quantitatively to show that the resulting explanation method outperforms the original in terms of faithfulness, localization, and stability. We also demonstrate that EVET can be used to achieve desirable performance with a low computational cost. For example, EVET-applied Grad-CAM achieves performance comparable to Score-CAM, which is the state-ofthe-art activation-based explanation method, while reducing execution time by more than 90% on VOC, COCO, and ImageNet."}

Previous image matting methods always focus on extracting a general object or portrait from the background in an image. In this paper, we try to solve the text matting problem, which extracts characters (usually WordArts) from the background in an image. Different from traditional image matting problems, text matting is much harder because of its foreground's three properties: smallness, multi-objectness, and complicated structures and boundaries. We propose a two-stage attentional text matting pipeline to solve the text matting problem. In the first stage, we utilize text detection methods to serve as the attention mechanism. In the second stage, we employ the attentional text regions and matting system to obtain mattes of these text regions. Finally, we post-process the mattes and obtain the final matte of the input image. We also construct a large-scale dataset with high-quality annotations consisting of 46,289 unique foregrounds to facilitate the learning and evaluation of text matting. Extensive experiments on this dataset and real images clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed pipeline over previous image matting methods on the task of text matting."}

Like other computer vision tasks, existing supervised video classification methods demand a large amount of labeled data to attain good performance. However, annotation of a large dataset is expensive and time consuming. To minimize the dependence on a large annotated dataset, our proposed semi-supervised method trains from a small number of labeled examples and exploits two regulatory signals from unlabeled data. The first signal is the pseudo-labels of unlabeled examples computed from the confidences of the CNN being trained. The other is the normalized probabilities, as predicted by an image classifier CNN, that captures the information about appearances of the interesting objects in the video. We show that, under the supervision of these guiding signals from unlabeled examples, a video classification CNN can achieve impressive performances utilizing a small fraction of annotated examples on three publicly available datasets: UCF101, HMDB51 and Kinetics."}

The existing methods take a top-down approach based on region-proposals (RPN), where the action is estimated based on the detected proposals followed by post-processing such as non-maximal suppression. While effective in terms of performance, these methods pose limitations in scalability for dense video scenes with a high memory requirement for thousands of proposals. We propose to solve this problem from a different perspective where we don't need any proposals. SSA2D is a unified network, which performs pixel level joint actor-action detection in a single-shot, where every pixel of the detected actor is assigned an action label. SSA2D has two main advantages: 1) It is a fully convolutional network which does not require any proposals and post-processing making it memory as well as time efficient, 2) It is easily scalable to dense video scenes as its memory requirement is independent of the number of actors present in the scene. We evaluate the proposed method on the Actor-Action dataset (A2D) and Video Object Relation (VidOR) dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in multiple actors and action detection in a video. SSA2D is 11x faster during inference with comparable (sometimes better) performance and fewer network parameters when compared with the prior works.

Existing methods mainly address the tasks of crack detection and segmentation that are only tailored for long-thin crack disease. However, there are many other types of diseases with a wider variety of sizes and patterns that are also essential to segment in practice, bringing more challenges towards fine-grained pavement inspection. In this paper, our goal is not only to automatically segment cracks, but also to segment other complex pavement diseases as well as typical landmarks (markings, runway lights, etc.) and commonly seen water/oil stains in a single model. To this end, we propose a three-stream boundary-aware network (TB-Net). It consists of three streams fusing the low-level spatial and the high-level contextual representations as well as the detailed boundary information. Specifically, the spatial stream captures rich spatial features. The context stream, where an attention mechanism is utilized, models the contextual relationships over local features. The boundary stream learns detailed boundaries using a global-gated convolution to further refine the segmentation outputs. The network is trained using a dual-task loss in an end-to-end manner, and experiments on a newly collected fine-grained pavement disease dataset show the effectiveness of our TB-Net."}

Training hand pose estimators with 3D hand mesh annotations and multi-view images often results in significant performance gains. However, existing multi-view datasets are relatively small with hand joints annotated by off-the-shelf trackers or automated through model predictions, both which may be inaccurate and can introduce biases. Collecting a large-scale multi-view 3D hand pose images with accurate mesh and joint annotations is valuable but strenuous. In this paper, we design a spin match algorithm that enables rigid mesh model matching without any target mesh ground truth. Based on the match algorithm, we propose an efficient pipeline to generate a large-scale multi-view hand mesh (MVHM) dataset with accurate 3D hand mesh and joint labels.

This paper aims to address these challenges to synthesize a long-term (>6000 ms) human motion trajectory across a large variety of human activity classes (>50). We propose a two-stage activity generation method to achieve this goal, where the first stage deals with learning the long-term global pose dependencies in activity sequences by learning to synthesize a sparse motion trajectory while the second stage addresses the generation of dense motion trajectories taking the output of the first stage.

One common drawback in currently popular skeleton-based human action recognition methods is that the sparse skeleton information alone is not sufficient to fully characterize human motion. This limitation makes several existing methods incapable of correctly classifying action categories which exhibit only subtle motion differences. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for employing human pose skeleton and joint-centered light-weight information jointly in a two-stream graph convolutional network, namely, JOLO-GCN. Specifically, we use Joint-aligned optical Flow Patches (JFP) to capture the local subtle motion around each joint as the pivotal joint-centered visual information. Compared to the pure skeleton-based baseline, this hybrid scheme effectively boosts performance, while keeping the computational and memory overheads low.

However, as navigation tasks mainly rely on reinforcement learning (RL) rewards in training, such weak supervision is insufficiently indicative for NAS to optimize visual perception network. Thus, we introduce imitation learning (IL) with optimal paths to optimize navigation policies while selecting an optimal architecture. As Auto-Navigator can obtain a direct supervision in every step, such guidance greatly facilitates architecture search. In particular, we initialize our Auto-Navigator with a learnable distribution over the search space of visual perception architecture, and then optimize the distribution with IL supervision. Afterwards, we employ an RL reward function to fine-tune our Auto-Navigator to improve the generalization ability of our model.

However, these models typically do not generalize well when applied on new domains, especially when going from synthetic to real data. In this paper we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which attempts to train on labelled data from one domain (source domain), and simultaneously learn from unlabelled data in the domain of interest (target domain). Existing methods have seen success by training on pseudo-labels for these unlabelled images. Multiple techniques have been proposed to mitigate low-quality pseudo-labels arising from the domain shift, with varying degrees of success. We propose DACS: Domain Adaptation via Cross-domain mixed Sampling, which mixes images from the two domains along with the corresponding labels and pseudo-labels.

Much research in this area aims at improving loss functions or network architectures. Most works, however, do not leverage self-supervision to its full potential. They stick to the standard closed world train-test pipeline, assuming the network parameters to be fixed after the training is finished. Such an assumption does not allow to adapt to new scenes, whereas with self-supervision this becomes possible without extra annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised Continuous Monocular Depth Adaptation method (CoMoDA), which adapts the pretrained model on a test video on the fly. As opposed to existing test-time refinement methods that use isolated frame triplets, we opt for continuous adaptation, making use of the previous experience from the same scene. We additionally augment the proposed procedure with the experience from the distant past, preventing the model from overfitting and thus forgetting already learnt information. We demonstrate that our method can be used for both intra- and cross-dataset adaptation. By adapting the model from train to test set of the Eigen split of KITTI, we achieve state-of-the-art depth estimation performance and surpass all existing methods using standard architectures.

Although video models designed from scratch produce temporally consistent results, training them to match the vast visual knowledge captured by image models requires an intractable number of videos. To combine the benefits of image and video models, we propose an image-to-video model transfer method called Hyperconsistency (HyperCon) that transforms any well-trained image model into a temporally consistent video model without fine-tuning. HyperCon works by translating a temporally interpolated video frame-wise and then aggregating over temporally localized windows on the interpolated video. It handles both masked and unmasked inputs, enabling support for even more video-to-video translation tasks than prior image-to-video model transfer techniques. We demonstrate HyperCon on video style transfer and inpainting, where it performs favorably compared to prior state-of-the-art methods without training on a single stylized or incomplete video."}

Yet, we observe that learning to be properly confident could behave like a powerful regularization and thus, could be an opportunity to improve performance. Precisely, we show that used within a framework of action detection, the learning of a self-assessment score is able to improve the whole action localization process. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on two action detection benchmarks. On THUMOS14 dataset, the mAP at tIoU@0.5 is improved from 42.8% to 44.6%, and from 50.4% to 51.7% on ActivityNet1.3 dataset. For lower tIoU values, we achieve even more significant improvements on both datasets."}

Our aim is to investigate this problem in the context of a forensic unlabeled dataset of over 1M human decomposition photos. To make this collection usable by experts, various body parts first need to be identified and traced through their evolution despite their distinct appearances at different stages of decay from \"fresh\" to \"skeletonized\". We developed an unsupervised technique for clustering images that builds sequences of similar images representing the evolution of each body part through stages of decomposition. Evaluation of our method on 34,476 human decomposition images shows that our method significantly outperforms the state of the art clustering method in this application."}

However, approaches usually adopt simple linear models that do not capture uncertainty and require extensive annotation effort to label a large number of set template landmarks for training. Conversely, supervised deep learning methods have been used on appearance directly (no explicit shape modelling) but these fail to capture detailed features that are clinically important. We present a supervised approach that combines both a non-linear generative shape model and a discriminative appearance-based convolutional neural network whilst quantifying uncertainty and relaxes the need for detailed, template based alignment for the training data. Our Bayesian framework couples the uncertainty from both the generator and the discriminator; our main contribution is the marginalisation of an intractable integral through the use of radial basis function approximations. We illustrate this model on the problem of segmenting bones from Psoriatic Arthritis hand radiographs and demonstrate that we can accurately measure the clinically important joint space gap between neighbouring bones."}

On the other hand, automated defect inspection is often constrained by the lack of defect samples, especially when we adopt deep neural networks for this task. This paper presents Defect-GAN, an automated defect synthesis network that generates realistic and diverse defect samples for training accurate and robust defect inspection networks. Defect-GAN learns through defacement and restoration processes, where the defacement generates defects on normal surface images while the restoration removes defects to generate normal images. It employs a novel compositional layer-based architecture for generating realistic defects within various image backgrounds with different textures and appearances. It can also mimic the stochastic variations of defects and offer flexible control over the locations and categories of the generated defects within the image background. Extensive experiments show that Defect-GAN is capable of synthesizing various defects with superior diversity and fidelity. In addition, the synthesized defect samples demonstrate their effectiveness in training better defect inspection networks."}

By seamlessly integrating CADA into RNN, the proposed MA-RNN can spatially align and aggregate temporal information guided by motion from frame to frame, leading to more effective representation that benefits a tracker from motion when handling occlusion, deformation, viewpoint change etc. Moreover, to deal with scale change, we present a monotonic bounding box regression (mBBR) approach that iteratively predicts regression offsets for target object under the guidance of intersection-over-union (IoU) score, guaranteeing non-decreasing accuracy. In extensive experiments on five benchmarks, including GOT-10k, LaSOT, TC-128, OTB-15 and VOT-19, our tracker MART consistently achieves state-of-the-art results and runs in real-time."}

This task - often called visual relationship detection (VRD) - must be solved to enable higher understanding of the semantic content in images. VRD can become particularly hard where there is severe statistical sparsity of some potentially involved objects, and the number of many relationships in standard training sets is limited. In this paper we show how to transduce auxiliary text so as to enable recognition of relationships absent in the visual training data. This transduction is performed by learning a shared relationship representation for both the textual and visual information. The proposed approach is model-agnostic and can be used as a plug-in module in existing VRD and scene graph generation (SGG) recognition systems to improve their performance and extend their capabilities. We consider the application of our technique using three widely accepted SGG models [20, 24, 16], and different auxiliary text sources: image captions, text generated by a deep text generation model (GPT-2), and ebooks from the Gutenberg Project. We conduct an extensive empirical study of both the VRD and SGG tasks over large-scale benchmark datasets. Our method is the first to enable recognition of visual relationships missing in the visual training data and appearing only in the auxiliary text. We conclusively show that text ingestion enables recognition of unseen visual relationships, and moreover, advances the state-of-the-art in all SGG tasks."}

Multi-Path Residual Network designs with a set of Residual concatenation Blocks stacked with Adaptive Residual Blocks: (i) to adaptively extract informative features and learn more expressive spatial context information; (ii) to better leverage multi-level representations before up-sampling stage; and (iii) to allow an efficient information and gradient flow within the network.

These networks are appealing because they replace laborious hand engineered building blocks but their black-box nature makes them difficult to delve in case of failure. Recent works have shown the importance of using an explicit intermediate representation that has the benefits of increasing both the interpretability and the accuracy of networks' decisions. Nonetheless, these camera-based networks reason in camera view where scale is not homogeneous and hence not directly suitable for motion forecasting. In this paper, we introduce a novel monocular camera-only holistic end-to-end trajectory planning network with a Bird-Eye-View (BEV) intermediate representation that comes in the form of binary Occupancy Grid Maps (OGMs). To ease the prediction of OGMs in BEV from camera images, we introduce a novel scheme where the OGMs are first predicted as semantic masks in camera view and then warped in BEV using the homography between the two planes. The key element allowing this transformation to be applied to 3D objects such as vehicles, consists in predicting solely their footprint in camera-view, hence respecting the flat world hypothesis implied by the homography."}

In this work, we propose a principled framework to simultaneously mitigate two fundamental issues in GANs: catastrophic forgetting of the discriminator and mode collapse of the generator. We achieve this by employing for GANs a contrastive learning and mutual information maximization approach, and perform extensive analyses to understand sources of improvements. Our approach significantly stabilizes GAN training and improves GAN performance for image synthesis across five datasets under the same training and evaluation conditions against state-of-the-art works. In particular, compared to the state-of-the-art SSGAN, our approach does not suffer from poorer performance on image domains such as faces, and instead improves performance significantly. Our approach is simple to implement and practical: it involves only one auxiliary objective, has low computational cost, and performs robustly across a wide range of training settings and datasets without any hyperparameter tuning. For reproducibility, our code is available in the open-source GAN library, Mimicry."}

In particular, deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained interest because their event-driven hardware implementations can consume very low energy. However, minimizing average spiking activity and thus energy consumption while preserving accuracy in deep SNNs remains a significant challenge and opportunity. This paper proposes a novel two-step SNN compression technique to reduce their spiking activity while maintaining accuracy that involves compressing specifically-designed artificial neural networks (ANNs) that are then converted into the target SNNs. Our approach uses an ultra-high ANN compression technique that is guided by the attention-maps of an uncompressed meta-model. We then evaluate the firing threshold of each ANN layer and start with the trained ANN weights to perform a sparse-learning-based supervised SNN training to minimize the number of timesteps required while retaining compression. To evaluate the merits of the proposed approach, we performed experiments with variants of VGG and ResNet, on both CIFAR-10and CIFAR-100, and VGG16 on Tiny-ImageNet. SNN mod-els generated through the proposed technique yield state-of-the-art compression ratios of up to 33.4x with no significant drop in accuracy compared to baseline unpruned counterparts. As opposed to the existing SNN pruning methods we achieve up to 8.3x better compression with no drop inaccuracy. Moreover, compressed SNN models generated by our methods can have up to 12.2x better compute energy-efficiency compared to ANNs that have a similar number of parameters."}

This has resulted in an improved matching between the visual representation of an image and the textual representation of its caption. Yet, current visual representations overlook a key aspect: the text appearing in images, which may contain crucial information for retrieval. In this paper, we first propose a new dataset that allows exploration of cross-modal retrieval where images contain scene-text instances. Then, armed with this dataset, we describe several approaches which leverage scene text, including a better scene-text aware cross-modal retrieval method which uses specialized representations for text from the captions and text from the visual scene, and reconcile them in a common embedding space. Extensive experiments confirm that cross-modal retrieval approaches benefit from scene text and highlight interesting research questions worth exploring further.

Traditional frameworks for this task like FreeSurfer demand lengthy runtimes, while its accelerated variant FastSurfer still relies on a voxel-wise segmentation which is limited by its resolution to capture narrow continuous objects as cortical surfaces. Having these limitations in mind, we propose DeepCSR, a 3D deep learning framework for cortical surface reconstruction from MRI. Towards this end, we train a neural network model with hypercolumn features to predict implicit surface representations for points in a brain template space. After training, the cortical surface at a desired level of detail is obtained by evaluating surface representations at specific coordinates, and subsequently applying a topology correction algorithm and an isosurface extraction method. Thanks to the continuous nature of this approach and the efficacy of its hypercolumn features scheme, DeepCSR efficiently reconstructs cortical surfaces at high resolution capturing fine details in the cortical folding. Moreover, DeepCSR is as accurate, more precise, and faster than the widely used FreeSurfer toolbox and its deep learning powered variant FastSurfer on reconstructing cortical surfaces from MRI which should facilitate large-scale medical studies and new healthcare applications."}

Unfortunately, the metric used most frequently to describe a model's performance, average categorization accuracy, is often used in isolation. As the number of classes increases, such as in fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC), the amount of information conveyed by average accuracy alone dwindles. While its most glaring weakness is its failure to describe the model's performance on a class-by-class basis, average accuracy also fails to describe how performance may vary from one trained model of the same architecture, on the same dataset, to another (both averaged across all categories and at the per-class level). We first demonstrate the magnitude of these variations across models and across class distributions based on attributes of the data, comparing results on different visual domains and different per-class image distributions, including long-tailed distributions and few-shot subsets. We then analyze the impact various FGVC methods have on overall and per-class variance. From this analysis, we both highlight the importance of reporting and comparing methods based on information beyond overall accuracy, as well as point out techniques that mitigate variance in FGVC results."}

It then solves the key data association problem using a novel frustum-based method to associate the radar detections to their corresponding object's center point. The associated radar detections are used to generate radar-based feature maps to complement the image features, and regress to object properties such as depth, rotation and velocity. We evaluateCenterFusion on the challenging nuScenes dataset, where it improves the overall nuScenes Detection Score (NDS) of the state-of-the-art camera-based algorithm by more than12%. We further show that CenterFusion significantly improves the velocity estimation accuracy without using any additional temporal information.

In this assessment, both appearance clues and pose dynamics features should be involved. Current approaches often treat a sports routine as a simple fine-grained action, while taking little heed of its complex temporal structure. Besides, most of them rely solely on either appearance or pose features to score the performance. In this paper, we present JCA and ADA blocks that are responsible for reasoning about the coordination among the joints and appearance dynamics throughout the performance. We build our two-stream network upon the separate stack of these blocks. The early blocks capture the fine-grained temporal dependencies while the last ones reason about the long-term coarse-grained relations. We further introduce an annotated dataset of sports images with unusual pose configurations to boost the performance of pose estimation in such scenarios. Our experiments show that the proposed method not only outperforms the previous works in short- term action assessment but also is the first to generalize well to minute-long figure-skating scoring."}

However, most existing pruning methods are not catered to or evaluated on semantic segmentation networks. In this paper, we advocate the importance of contextual information during channel pruning for semantic segmentation networks by presenting a novel Context-aware Pruning framework. Concretely, we formulate the embedded contextual information by leveraging the layer-wise channels interdependency via the Context-aware Guiding Module (CAGM) and introduce the Context-aware Guided Sparsification (CAGS) to adaptively identify the informative channels on the cumbersome model by inducing channel-wise sparsity on the scaling factors in batch normalization (BN) layers. The resulting pruned models require significantly lesser operations for inference while maintaining comparable performance to (at times outperforming) the original models. We evaluated our framework on widely-used benchmarks and showed its effectiveness on both large and lightweight models.

These real-time systems require effective classification methods that are robust to various sampling resolutions, noisy measurements, and unconstrained pose configurations. Previous research has shown that points' sparsity, rotation and positional inherent variance can lead to a significant drop in the performance of point cloud based classification techniques. However, neither of them is sufficiently robust to multifactorial variance and significant sparsity. In this regard, we propose a novel approach for 3D classification that can simultaneously achieve invariance towards rotation, positional shift, scaling, and is robust to point sparsity. To this end, we introduce a new feature that utilizes graph structure of point clouds, which can be learned end-to-end with our proposed neural network to acquire a robust latent representation of the 3D object. We show that such latent representations can significantly improve the performance of object classification and retrieval tasks when points are sparse. Further, we show that our approach outperforms PointNet and 3DmFV by 35.0% and 28.1% respectively in ModelNet 40 classification tasks using sparse point clouds of only 16 points under arbitrary SO(3) rotation."}

We propose a self-supervised approach (LT-GAN) to improve the generation quality and diversity of images by estimating the GAN-induced transformation (i.e. transformation induced in the generated images by perturbing the latent space of generator). Specifically, given two pairs of images where each pair comprises of a generated image and its transformed version, the self-supervision task aims to identify whether the latent transformation applied in the given pair is same as that of the other pair. Hence, this auxiliary loss encourages the generator to produce images that are distinguishable by the auxiliary network, which in turn promotes the synthesis of semantically consistent images with respect to latent transformations. We show the efficacy of this pretext task by improving the image generation quality in terms of FID on state-of-the-art models in conditional and unconditional settings on CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. Moreover, we empirically show that LT-GAN helps in improving controlled image editing for CelebA-HQ, and ImageNet over baseline models. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed LT self-supervision task can be effectively combined with other state-of-the-art training techniques for added benefits. Consequently, we show that our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art FID score of 9.8 on conditional CIFAR-10 image generation."}

Besides, its global mask representation often leads to superior accuracy to the two-stage Mask R-CNN which has been dominant thus far. Despite the promising advances in single-stage methods, finer delineation of instance boundaries still remains unexcavated. Indeed, boundary information provides a strong shape representation that can operate in synergy with the fully-convolutional mask features of the single-stage segmented. In this work, we propose Boundary Basis based Instance Segmentation(B2Inst) to learn a global boundary representation that can complement existing global-mask-based methods that are often lacking high-frequency details. Besides, we devise a unified quality measure of both mask and boundary and introduce a network block that learns to score the per-instance predictions of itself. When applied to the strongest baselines in single-stage instance segmentation, our B2Inst leads to consistent improvements and accurately parse out the instance boundaries in a scene. Regardless of being single-stage or two-stage frameworks, we outperform the existing state-of-the-art methods on the COCO dataset with the same ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 backbones."}

This task has two main challenges. The first is to maintain the spatial consistency in contents of generated regions and the original input. The second is to generate a high-quality large image with a small amount of adjacent information. Conventional image outpainting methods generate inconsistent, blurry, and repeated pixels. To alleviate the difficulty of an outpainting problem, we propose a novel image outpainting method using bidirectional boundary region rearrangement. We rearrange the image to benefit from the image inpainting task by reflecting more directional information. The bidirectional boundary region rearrangement enables the generation of the missing region using bidirectional information similar to that of the image inpainting task, thereby generating the higher quality than the conventional methods using unidirectional information. Moreover, we use the edge map generator that considers images as original input with structural information and hallucinates the edges of unknown regions to generate the image. Our proposed method is compared with other state-of-the-art outpainting and inpainting methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. We further compared and evaluated them using BRISQUE, one of the No-Reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, to evaluate the naturalness of the output.

This practical scenario creates a bottleneck in the domain adaptation problem. This paper addresses this challenging scenario by proposing a domain adaptation technique that does not need any source data. Instead of the source data, we are only provided with a classifier that is trained on the source data. Our proposed approach is based on a generative framework, where the trained classifier is used for generating samples from the source classes. We learn the joint distribution of data by using the energy-based modeling of the trained classifier. At the same time, a new classifier is also adapted for the target domain.

In many tasks, however, satisfying these requirements can be a formidable challenge. In this paper, we contend that histopathology image classification is a compelling use case for curriculum learning. Based on the nature of histopathology images, a range of difficulty inherently exists among examples, and, since medical datasets are often labeled by multiple annotators, annotator agreement can be used as a natural proxy for the difficulty of a given example. Hence, we propose a simple curriculum learning method that trains on progressively-harder images as determined by annotator agreement. We evaluate our hypothesis on the challenging and clinically-important task of colorectal polyp classification. Whereas vanilla training achieves an AUC of 83.7% for this task, a model trained with our proposed curriculum learning approach achieves an AUC of 88.2%, an improvement of 4.5%. Our work aims to inspire researchers to think more creatively and rigorously when choosing contexts for applying curriculum learning."}

The RarePlanes dataset specifically focuses on the value of synthetic data to aid computer vision algorithms in their ability to automatically detect aircraft and their attributes in satellite imagery. Although other synthetic/real combination datasets exist, RarePlanes is the largest openly-available very-high resolution dataset built to test the value of synthetic data from an overhead perspective. Previous research has shown that synthetic data can reduce the amount of real training data needed and potentially improve performance for many tasks in the computer vision domain. The real portion of the dataset consists of 253 Maxar WorldView-3 satellite scenes spanning 112 locations and 2,142 km^2 with 14,700 hand-annotated aircraft. The accompanying synthetic dataset is generated via AI.Reverie's simulation platform and features 50,000 synthetic satellite images simulating a total area of 9331.2 km^2 with  630,000 aircraft annotations. Both the real and synthetically generated aircraft feature 10 fine grain attributes including: aircraft length, wingspan, wing-shape, wing-position, wingspan class, propulsion, number of engines, number of vertical-stabilizers, presence of canards, and aircraft role. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the real and synthetic datasets and compare performances. By doing so, we show the value of synthetic data for the task of detecting and classifying aircraft from an overhead perspective."}

A compact and accurate pose estimation methodology is of paramount importance for on-device inference in such applications. Our proposed solution 3DPoseLite, estimates pose of generic objects by utilizing a compact node embedding representation, unlike computationally expensive multi-view and point-cloud representations. The neural network outputs a 3D pose, taking RGB image and its corresponding graph (obtained by skeletonizing the 3D meshes) as inputs. Our approach utilizes node2vec framework to learn low-dimensional representations for nodes in a graph by optimizing a neighborhood preserving objective. We achieve a space and time reduction by a factor of 11x and 3x respectively, with respect to the state-of-the-art approach, PoseFromShape, on benchmark Pascal3D dataset. We also test the performance of our model on unseen data using Pix3D dataset."}

Prior work uses co-attention mechanisms to understand relationships between the vision and language data, but they lack contextual information between video frames that can be useful to determine how well a segment relates to the query. To address this, we propose an efficient Latent Graph Co-Attention Network (LoGAN) that exploits fine-grained frame-by-word interactions to jointly reason about the correspondences between all possible pairs of frames, providing context cues absent in prior work. Experiments on the DiDeMo and Charades-STA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where we improve Recall@1 by 5-20% over prior weakly-supervised methods, even boasting an 11% gain over strongly-supervised methods on DiDeMo, while also using significantly fewer model parameters than other co-attention mechanisms."}

We demonstrate the sensor's efficacy for both multi-modal object recognition and metrology. Object recognition is typically formulated as an unimodal task, but by combining two sensor modalities we show that we can achieve several significant performance improvements. This sensor, named the See-Through-your-Skin sensor (STS), is designed to provide rich multi-modal sensing of contact surfaces. Inspired by recent developments in optical tactile sensing technology, we address a key missing feature of these sensors: the ability to capture a visual perspective of the region beyond the contact surface. Whereas optical tactile sensors are typically opaque, we present a sensor with a semitransparent skin that has the dual capabilities of acting as a tactile sensor and/or as a visual camera depending on its internal lighting conditions. This paper details the design of the sensor, showcases its dual sensing capabilities, and presents a deep learning architecture that fuses vision and touch. We validate the ability of the sensor to classify household objects, recognize fine textures, and infer their physical properties both through numerical simulations and experimentally with a smart countertop prototype."}

In these areas, it is important to have confidence that the CNN is working as expected and explanations from saliency maps provide an efficient way of doing this. In this paper, we propose a pair of complementary contributions that improve upon the state of the art for region-based explanations in both accuracy and utility. The first is SWAG, a method for generating accurate explanations quickly using superpixels for discriminative regions which is meant to be a more accurate, efficient, and tunable drop in replacement method for Grad-CAM, LIME, or other region-based methods. The second contribution is based on an investigation into how to best generate the superpixels used to represent the features found within the image. Using SWAG, we compare using superpixels created from the image, a combination of the image and backpropagated gradients, and the gradients themselves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method proposed to generate explanations using superpixels explicitly created to represent the discriminative features important to the network. To compare we use both ImageNet and challenging fine-grained datasets over a range of metrics. We demonstrate experimentally that our methods provide the best local and global accuracy compared to Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, LIME, XRAI, and RISE."}

RGPNet consists of a light-weight asymmetric encoder-decoder and an adaptor. The adaptor helps preserve and refine the abstract concepts from multiple levels of distributed representations between encoder and decoder. It also facilitates the gradient flow from deeper layers to shallower layers. Our experiments demonstrate that RGPNet can generate segmentation results in real-time with comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art non-real-time heavy models. Moreover, towards green AI, we show that using an optimized label-relaxation technique with progressive resizing can reduce the training time by up to 60% while preserving the performance. We conclude that RGPNet obtains a better speed-accuracy trade-off across multiple datasets."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2021", "Area": "CV", "Where": "WACV", "Abbreviation": "ADA-AT/DT", "Title": "An Adversarial Approach for Cross-Domain and Cross-Task Knowledge Transfer", "Abstract": "We deal with the problem of cross-task and cross-domain knowledge transfer in the realm of scene understanding for autonomous vehicles. We consider the scenario where supervision is available for a pair of tasks in a source domain while it is available for only one of the tasks in the target domain. Given that, the goal is to perform inference for the task in the target which is devoid of any training information. We argue that the only reported work in learning across tasks and domains (AT/DT) [23] faces the problem of domain shift between the source and target domains, hindering predictions on the target domain when the transfer of knowledge is learned on a statistically different yet related source domain. As a remedy, we develop a novel framework called ADA-AT/DT based on the adversarial training strategy to ensure that the domain-gaps are minimized for the common cross-domain supervised task. This, in effect, helps in realizing a domain-independent task-transfer function that eventually helps in performing improved inference in the target domain. We demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms [23] by using models with 81% fewer trainable parameters. In addition, we perform experiments on a transformation mapping similar to U-Net to ensure maximum exploitation of features for task transfer. Extensive experiments have been performed on four different domains (Synthia, CityScapes, Carla, and KITTI) for two visual tasks (depth estimation and semantic segmentation) to confirm the superiority of our method."}

Existing open set classifiers distinguish between known and unknown classes by measuring distance in a network's logit space, assuming that known classes cluster closer to the training data than unknown classes. However, this approach is applied post-hoc to networks trained with cross-entropy loss, which does not guarantee this clustering behaviour. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Class Anchor Clustering (CAC) loss. CAC is a distance-based loss that explicitly trains known classes to form tight clusters around anchored class-dependent centres in the logit space. We show that training with CAC achieves state-of-the-art performance for distance-based open set classifiers on all six standard benchmark datasets, with a 15.2% AUROC increase on the challenging TinyImageNet, without sacrificing classification accuracy. We also show that our anchored class centres achieve higher open set performance than learnt class centres, particularly on object-based datasets and large numbers of training classes."}

Most state-of-the-art localization approaches assume static scenes, so maps are often reconstructed once and then kept constant. However, many scenes are dynamic and as changes in the scene happen, future localization attempts may struggle or fail entirely. Therefore, it is important for successful long-term localization to update and maintain maps as new observations of the scene, and changes in it, arrive. We propose a novel method for automatically discovering which points in a map remain stable over time, and which are due to transient changes. To this end, we calculate a stability store for each point based on its visibility over time, weighted by an exponential decay over time. This allows us to introduce the impact of time when scoring points, and distinguishes which points are useful for long-term localization. We evaluate our method on the CMU Extended Seasons dataset (outdoors) and a new indoor dataset of a retail shop, and show the benefit of maintaining a `live map' that integrates updates over time using our exponential decay based method over a static `base map'."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2021", "Area": "CV", "Where": "WACV", "Abbreviation": "FACEGAN", "Title": "Facial Attribute Controllable rEenactment GAN", "Abstract": "The face reenactment is a popular facial animation method where the person's identity is taken from the source image and the facial motion from the driving image. Recent works have demonstrated high-quality results by combin- ing the facial landmark-based motion representations with the generative adversarial networks. These models perform best if the source and driving images depict the same person or if the facial structures are otherwise very similar. However, if the identity differs, the driving facial structures leak to the output distorting the reenactment result. We propose a novel Facial Attribute Controllable rEenactment GAN (FACEGAN), which transfers the facial motion from the driving face via the Action Unit (AU) representation. Unlike facial landmarks, the AUs are independent of the facial structure preventing the identity leak. Moreover, AUs provide a human interpretable way to control the reenactment. FACEGAN processes background and face regions separately for optimized output quality. The extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons show a clear improvement over the state-of-the-art in a single source reenactment task. The results are best illustrated in the reenactment video provided in the supplementary material. The source code will be made available upon publication of the paper."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2021", "Area": "CV", "Where": "WACV", "Abbreviation": "RNNP", "Title": "A Robust Few-Shot Learning Approach", "Abstract": "Learning from a few examples is an important practical aspect of training classifiers. Various works have examined this aspect quite well. However, all existing approaches assume that the few examples provided are always correctly labeled. This is a strong assumption, especially if one considers the current techniques for labeling using crowd-based labeling services. We address this issue by proposing a novel robust few-shot learning approach. Our method relies on generating robust prototypes from a set of few examples. Specifically, our method refines the class prototypes by producing hybrid features from the support examples of each class. The refined prototypes help to classify the query images better. Our method can replace the evaluation phase of any few-shot learning method that uses a nearest neighbor prototype-based evaluation procedure to make them robust. We evaluate our method on standard mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet datasets. We perform experiments with various label corruption rates in the support examples of the few-shot classes. We obtain significant improvement over widely used few-shot learning methods that suffer significant performance degeneration in the presence of label noise. We finally provide extensive ablation experiments to validate our method."}

Current passive image-based depth estimation algorithms focus on color images from RGB sensors, which is not suitable for dark and night environment with limited lighting resource. In this paper, we propose a framework to estimate the scene depth directly from a single thermal image that can still observe the scene in the low lighting condition. We learn the thermal image depth estimation framework together with RGB cameras, which also mitigates the training condition due to the easy availability of RGB cameras. With the translated thermal images from color images from our generative adversarial network, our depth estimation method can explore the unique characteristics in thermal images through our novel contour and edge-aware constraints to obtain a stable and anti-artifact disparity. We apply the commonly available color cameras to navigate the learning process of thermal image depth estimation framework. With our approach, an accurate depth map can be predicted without any prior knowledge under various illumination conditions. Experiments in public dataset, as well as our newly collected data, demonstrate superior performance of our method on single thermal image depth estimation compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms."}

In this context, Partial Least Squares (PLS) has presented notable results in tasks such as image classification and neural network optimization. However, PLS is infeasible on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) because it requires all the data to be in memory in advance, which is often impractical due to hardware limitations. Additionally, this requirement prevents us from employing PLS on streaming applications where the data are being continuously generated. Motivated by this, we propose a novel incremental PLS, named Covariance-free Incremental Partial Least Squares (CIPLS), which learns a low-dimensional representation of the data using a single sample at a time. In contrast to other state-of-the-art approaches, instead of adopting a partially-discriminative or SGD-based model, we extend Nonlinear Iterative Partial Least Squares (NIPALS) -- the standard algorithm used to compute PLS -- for incremental processing. Among the advantages of this approach are the preservation of discriminative information across all components, the possibility of employing its score matrices for feature selection, and its computational efficiency. We validate CIPLS on face verification and image classification tasks, where it outperforms several other incremental dimensionality reduction methods. In the context of feature selection, CIPLS achieves comparable results when compared to state-of-the-art techniques."}

However, as the depth and width of the networks increase, CNN-based SR methods have been faced with the challenge of computational complexity in practice. Moreover, most SR methods train a dedicated model for each target resolution, losing generality and increasing memory requirements. To address these limitations we introduce OverNet, a deep but lightweight convolutional network to solve SISR at arbitrary scale factors with a single model. We make the following contributions: first, we introduce a lightweight feature extractor that enforces efficient reuse of information through a novel recursive structure of skip and dense connections. Second, to maximize the performance of the feature extractor, we propose a model agnostic reconstruction module that generates accurate high-resolution images from overscaled feature maps obtained from any SR architecture. Third, we introduce a multi-scale loss function to achieve generalization across scales. Experiments show that our proposal outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in standard benchmarks, while maintaining relatively low computation and memory requirements."}

To enable richer analysis and understanding of human activities, we introduce IKEA ASM---a three million frame, multi-view, furniture assembly video dataset that includes depth, atomic actions, object segmentation, and human poses. Additionally, we benchmark prominent methods for video action recognition, object segmentation and human pose estimation tasks on this challenging dataset. The dataset enables the development of holistic methods, which integrate multi-modal and multi-view data to better perform on these tasks."}

The transcript (textual cues) often reveals little, so audio-visual cues including voice tone as well as facial and body behaviour are the main focuses for automated IID. Contextual cues are also crucial, since a person's implicit intentions are often correlated and context-dependent when the person moves from one question-answer pair to the next. However, no such dataset exists which contains fine-grained question-answer pair (video segment) level annotation. The first contribution of this work is thus a new benchmark dataset, called Vid2Int-Deception to fill this gap. A novel multi-grain representation model is also proposed to capture the subtle movement changes of eyes, face, and body (relevant for inferring intention) from a long dialog video. Moreover, to model the temporal correlation between the implicit intentions across video segments, we propose a Video-to-Intention network (Vid2Int) based on attentive recurrent neural network (RNN). Extensive experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results."}

We argue this ability is largely due to three main reasons: the incorporation of prior knowledge (or experience), the adaptation of it to the new environment using the observed visual cues and most importantly optimistically searching without giving up early.This is currently missing in the state-of-the-art visual navigation methods based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we propose to use externally learned prior knowledge of the relative object locations and integrate it into our model by constructing a neural graph. In order to efficiently incorporate the graph without increasing the state-space complexity, we propose Graph-based Value Estimation (GVE) module. GVE provides a more accurate baseline for estimating the Advantage function in actor-critic RL algorithm. This results in reduced value estimation error and, consequently, convergence to a more optimal policy. Through empirical studies, we show that our agent, dubbed as the optimistic agent, has a more realistic estimate of the state value during a navigation episode which leads to a higher success rate. Our extensive ablation studies show the efficacy of our simple method which achieves the state-of-the-art results measured by the conventional visual navigation metrics, e.g. Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), in AI2THOR environment."}

While recent visual localization algorithms demonstrate promising results in terms of accuracy and robustness, the associated high computational cost requires running these algorithms on server-sides rather than client devices. This paper proposes a real time monocular visual localization system that combines client-side visual odometry with server-side visual localization functionality. In particular, the proposed system utilizes handcrafted features for real time visual odometry while adopting learned features for robust visual localization. To link the two components, the proposed system employs a map alignment mechanism that transforms the local coordinates obtained using visual odometry to global coordinates. The system achieves comparable accuracy to that of the state-of-the-art structure-based methods and end-to-end methods for the visual localization on both indoor and outdoor datasets while operating in real time."}

Existing data-driven counting works still have difficulties in generalizing to real-world retail product counting scenarios, since (1) real check-out images are hard to collect or cover all products and their possible layouts, (2) rapid updating of the product list leads to frequent and tedious re-training of the counting models. To overcome these obstacles, we contribute a practical automatic check-out framework tailored to real-world retail product counting scenarios, consisting of a photorealistic exemplar augmentation to generate physically reliable and photorealistic check-out images from canonical exemplars scanned for each product, and an incremental learning strategy to match the updating nature of the ACO system with much fewer training effort. Through comprehensive studies, we show that the proposed IncreACO serves as an effective framework on recent Retail Product Checkout (RPC) dataset, where the proposed photorealistic exemplar augmentation remarkably improves the counting performance against the state-of-the-art methods (77.15% v.s. 72.83% in counting accuracy), whilst the proposed incremental learning framework consistently extends the counting performance to new categories."}

Typical approaches for PPE detection based on deep learning are (i) to train an object detector for items such as those listed above or (ii) to train a person detector and a classifier that takes the bounding boxes predicted by the detector and discriminates between people wearing and people not wearing the corresponding PPE items. We propose a novel and accurate approach that uses three components: a person detector, a body pose estimator and a classifier. Our novelty consists in using the pose estimator only at training time, to improve the prediction performance of the classifier. We modify the neural architecture of the classifier by adding a spatial attention mechanism, which is trained using supervision signal from the pose estimator. In this way, the classifier learns to focus on PPE items, using knowledge from the pose estimator with almost no computational overhead during inference."}

Some recent blind SR algorithms have been proposed to estimate different downscaling kernels for each input LR image. However, they suffer from heavy computational overhead, making them infeasible for direct application to videos. In this work, we present DynaVSR, a novel meta-learning-based framework for real-world video SR that enables efficient downscaling model estimation and adaptation to the current input. Specifically, we train a multi-frame downscaling module with various types of synthetic blur kernels, which is seamlessly combined with a video SR network for input-aware adaptation. Experimental results show that DynaVSR consistently improves the performance of the state-of-the-art video SR models by a large margin, with an order of magnitude faster inference time compared to the existing blind SR approaches."}

However, such capability remains absent in state-of-the-art detectors. To bridge this gap, several attempts have been proposed to perform few-shot detection by incorporating meta-learning techniques. Such methods can improve detection performance on unseen categories, but also add huge computational burden, and usually degrade detection performance on seen categories. In this paper, we present PNPDet, a novel Plug-and-Play Detector, for efficient few-shot detection without forgetting. It introduces a simple but effective architecture with separate sub-networks that disentangles the recognition of base and novel categories and prevents hurting performance on known categories while learning new concepts. Distance metric learning is further incorporated into sub-networks, consistently boosting detection performance for both base and novel categories.

In this paper, we introduce a novel theory and metric to identify layers that decrease the test accuracy of the trained models, this identification is done as early as at the beginning of training. In the worst-case, such a layer could lead to a network that can not be trained at all. More precisely, we identified those layers that worsen the performance because they produce conflicting training bundles as we show in our novel theoretical analysis, complemented by our extensive empirical studies. Based on these findings, a novel algorithm is introduced to remove performance decreasing layers automatically. Architectures found by this algorithm achieve a competitive accuracy when compared against the state-of-the-art architectures. While keeping such high accuracy, our approach drastically reduces memory consumption and inference time for different computer vision tasks."}

Instead of relying on defective images that are difficult to collect and laborious to label, our framework can accept datasets with unlabeled images. Moreover, unlike most anomaly detection methods, our approach is robust against noises, or defective images, in the training dataset. Our framework uses a memory-augmented auto-encoder with a sparse memory addressing scheme to avoid over-generalizing the auto-encoder, and a novel trust-region memory updating scheme to keep the noises away from the memory slots. The result is a framework that can reconstruct defect-free images and identify the defective regions using a perceptual distance network. When compared against various state-of-the-art baselines, our approach performs competitively under noise-free MVTec datasets. More importantly, it remains effective at a noise level up to 40% while significantly outperforming other baselines."}

However, this assumption is often invalid, especially when it comes to fine-grained recognition. In this work, we define a new FSL setting termed scarce-source few-shot learning (SSFSL), under which both the source and target classes have limited training samples. To overcome the source class data scarcity problem, a natural option is to crawl images from the web with class names as search keywords. However, the crawled images are inevitably corrupted by large amount of noise (irrelevant images) and thus may harm the performance. To address this problem, we propose a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based label denoising (LDN) method to remove the irrelevant images. Further, with the cleaned web images as well as the original clean training images, we propose a GCN-based FSL method. For both the LDN and FSL tasks, a novel adaptive aggregation GCN (AdarGCN) model is proposed, which differs from existing GCN models in that adaptive aggregation is performed based on a multi-head multi-level aggregation module. With AdarGCN, how much and how far information carried by each graph node is propagated in the graph structure can be determined automatically, therefore alleviating the effects of both noisy and outlying training samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our AdarGCN under both the new SSFSL and the conventional FSL settings."}

Therefore, we present the first large-scale Motorcycles Re-Identification (MoRe) dataset. MoRe consists of 3,827 individuals (i.e., the set of motorbikes and motorcyclist) captured by ten surveillance cameras placed in Brazil's urban traffic scenarios. Furthermore, we evaluate a deep learning model trained using well-known training tricks from the object re-identification literature to present a strong baseline for the motorcycle re-identification (ReID) problem. More importantly, we highlight some crucial problems in this topic as the influence of distractors and the domain shift. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the strong baseline model with an increase of at least 19.27 p.p. in the rank-1 when compared to the state-of-the-art in the BPReID dataset. Finally, we present some insights regarding the information learned by the strong baseline model when computing the similarities between motorcycle images."}

However, one of the remaining fundamental limitations of these models is the ability to flexibly control the generative process, e.g. change the camera and human pose while retaining the subject identity. At the same time, deformable human body models like SMPL and its successors provide full control over pose and shape but rely on classic computer graphics pipelines for rendering. Such rendering pipelines require explicit mesh rasterization that (a) does not have the potential to fix artifacts or lack of realism in the original 3D geometry and (b) until recently, were not fully incorporated into deep learning frameworks. In this work, we propose to bridge the gap between classic geometry-based rendering and the latest generative networks operating in pixel space. We train a network that directly converts a sparse set of 3D mesh vertices into photorealistic images, alleviating the need for traditional rasterization mechanism. We train our model on a large corpus of human 3D models and corresponding real photos, and show the advantage over conventional differentiable renderers both in terms of the level of photorealism and rendering efficiency."}

The goal of this paper is to develop an end-end cranberry health monitoring system to enable and support real time cranberry over-heating assessment to facilitate informed decisions that may sustain the economic viability of the farm. Toward this goal, we propose two main deep learning-based modules for: 1) cranberry fruit segmentation to delineate the exact fruit regions in the cranberry field image that are exposed to sun, 2) prediction of cloud coverage conditions to estimate the inner temperature of exposed cranberries We develop drone-based field data and ground-based sky data collection systems to collect video imagery at multiple time points for use in crop health analysis. Extensive evaluation on the data set shows that it is possible to predict exposed fruit's inner temperature with high accuracy (0.02% MAPE) when irradiance is predicted with 5.59-19.84% MAPE in the 5-20 minutes time horizon. With 62.54% mIoU for segmentation and 13.46 MAE for counting accuracies in exposed fruit identification, this system is capable of giving informed feedback to growers to take precautionary action (e.g., irrigation) in identified crop field regions with higher risk of sunburn in the near future. Though this novel system is applied for cranberry health monitoring, it represents a pioneering step forward in efficiency for farming and is useful in precision agriculture beyond the problem of cranberry overheating."}

Recently, efforts to train machines to mimic this ability of humans in the form of weakly supervised object localization, using training labels only at the image-level, have garnered a lot of attention. Nonetheless, one of the well-known problems that most of the existing methods suffer from is localizing only the most discriminative part of an object. Such methods provide very little or no focus on other pertinent parts of the object. In this paper, we propose a novel way of scrupulously localizing objects using training with labels as for the entire image by mining information from complementary regions in an image. Primarily, we adapt to regional dropout at complementary spatial locations to create two intermediate images. With the help of a novel Channel-wise Assisted Attention Module (CAAM) coupled with a Spatial Self-Attention Module (SSAM), we parallely train our model to leverage the information from complementary image regions for excellent localization. Finally, we fuse the attention maps generated by the two classifiers using our Attention-based Fusion Loss. Several experimental studies manifest the superior performance of our proposed approach. Our method demonstrates a significant increase in localization performance over the existing state-of-the-art methods on CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC 2016 datasets."}

RefineLoc uses an iterative refinement approach by estimating and training on snippet-level pseudo ground truth at every iteration. We show the benefit of this iterative approach and present an extensive analysis of five different pseudo ground truth generators. We show the effectiveness of our model on two standard action datasets, ActivityNet v1.2 and THUMOS14. RefineLoc shows competitive results with the state-of-the-art in weakly-supervised temporal localization. Additionally, our iterative refinement process is able to significantly improve the performance of two state-of-the-art methods, setting a new state-of-the-art on THUMOS14."}

Existing methods, such as PointNetVLAD, are based on unordered point cloud representation. They use PointNet as the first processing step to extract local features, which are later aggregated into a global descriptor. The PointNet architecture is not well suited to capture local geometric structures. Thus, state-of-the-art methods enhance vanilla PointNet architecture by adding different mechanism to capture local contextual information, such as graph convolutional networks or using hand-crafted features. We present an alternative approach, dubbed MinkLoc3D, to compute a discriminative 3D point cloud descriptor, based on a sparse voxelized point cloud representation and sparse 3D convolutions. The proposed method has a simple and efficient architecture. Evaluation on standard benchmarks proves that MinkLoc3D outperforms current state-of-the-art.

Our formulation explicitly models the variations in the correlation filters and associated spatial weights in successive frames. By imposing a sparsity penalty on these variations, the formulation ensures that only relevant changes are incorporated during updates. This results in more robust filter coefficients that minimize the tracking drift. The IGSSTRCF also includes an adaptive channel importance estimation strategy that assigns an importance weight to each feature channel during training. The proposed formulation is efficiently solved via the alternating direction method of multipliers. A comparative analysis is shown on TC128, UAV123, VOT-2017, and VOT-2019 datasets; and we present an ablation study to demonstrate the contribution of each component of the IGSSTRCF. It is observed that we outperform several state-of-the-art trackers and each component of the proposed IGSSTRCF contributes positively towards tracker performance."}

This combination overcomes many obstacles encountered by autonomous vehicles or robots employed in agricultural environments, such as overly repetitive patterns, need for very detailed reconstructions, and abrupt movements caused by uneven roads. Furthermore, the use of a monocular SLAM makes our system much easier to integrate with an existing device, as we do not rely on a LiDAR (which is expensive and power consuming), or stereo camera (whose calibration is sensitive to external perturbation e.g. camera being displaced). To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first evaluation results for monocular SLAM, and our work further explores unsupervised depth estimation on this specific application scenario by simulating RGB-D SLAM to tackle the scale ambiguity, and shows our approach produces reconstructions that are helpful to various agricultural tasks. Moreover, we highlight that our experiments provide meaningful insight to improve monocular SLAM systems under agricultural settings."}

Nonetheless, its accuracy often still suffers from several sources of variation that can be found in real-world images. Some of the most challenging variation are induced by changing lighting conditions. This paper presents a novel approach for tackling bright-ness variation in the domain of 2D object detection and 6D object pose estimation. Existing works aiming at improving robustness towards different lighting conditions are of-ten grounded on classical computer vision contrast normalisation techniques or the acquisition of large amounts of an-notated data in order to achieve invariance during training.While the former cannot generalise well to a wide range of illumination conditions, the latter is neither practical nor scalable. Hence, we propose the usage of Generative Adversarial Network in order to learn how to normalise the illumination of an input image. Thereby, the generator is explicitly designed to normalise illumination in images soto enhance the object recognition performance. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that leveraging the generated data can significantly enhance the detection performance, out-performing all other state-of-the-art methods. We further constitute a natural extension focusing on white balance variations and introduce a new dataset for evaluation."}

However, recent works in image style transfer are overused. They usually synthesize undesirable results due to transferring exact colors to the wrong destination. It becomes even worse in sensitive cases such as portraits. In this work, we concentrate on learning low-level image transformation, especially color-shifting methods, rather than contextual features matching, then present a novel supervised approach for color style transfer. Furthermore, we propose a color style transfer named Deep Preset designed to 1) generalize the features representing the color transformation from content with natural colors to retouched reference, then blend it into the contextual features of content, 2) predict hyper-parameters (settings or preset) of the applied low-level color transformation methods, 3) stylize content image to have a similar color style as reference. We script Lightroom, a powerful tool in editing photos, to generate 600,000 training samples using 1,200 images from the Flick2K dataset and 500 user-generated presets with 69 settings. Experimental results show that our Deep Preset outperforms the previous works in color style transfer quantitatively and qualitatively.

Unfortunately, most documents are stored and distributed as PDF or scanned images, which fail to preserve table formatting. Recent vision-based deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this gap, but most still cannot achieve state-of-the-art results. We present Global Table Extractor (GTE), a vision-guided systematic framework for joint table detection and cell structured recognition, which could be built on top of any object detection model. With GTE-Table, we invent a new penalty based on the natural cell containment constraint of tables to train our table network aided by cell location predictions. GTE-Cell is a new hierarchical cell detection network that leverages table styles. Further, we design a method to automatically label table and cell structure in existing documents to cheaply create a large corpus of training and test data. We use this to enhance PubTabNet with cell labels and create FinTabNet, real-world and complex scientific and financial datasets with detailed table structure annotations to help train and test structure recognition. Our deep learning framework surpasses previous state-of-the-art results on the ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2019 table competition test dataset in both table detection and cell structure recognition.

A prime example is the analysis of aggression videos: in a criminal incidence, typically suspects need to be identified based on their clean portrait-like photos, instead of their prior video recordings. This results in three major challenges; large domain discrepancy between violence videos and ID-photos, the lack of video examples for most individuals and limited training data availability. To mimic such scenarios, we formulate a realistic domain-transfer problem, where the goal is to transfer the recognition model trained on clean posed images to the target domain of violent videos, where training videos are available only for a subset of subjects. To this end, we introduce the \"WildestFaces\" dataset, tailored to study cross-domain recognition under a variety of adverse conditions. We divide the task of transferring a recognition model from the domain of clean images to the violent videos into two sub-problems and tackle them using (i) stacked affine-transforms for classifier-transfer, (ii) attention-driven pooling for temporal-adaptation. We additionally formulate a self attention based model for domain-transfer. We establish a rigorous evaluation protocol for this \"clean-to-violent\" recognition task, and present a detailed analysis of the proposed dataset and the methods. Our experiments highlight the unique challenges introduced by the Wildest-Faces dataset and the advantages of the proposed approach."}

Each of these factors may cause serious problems for a tracker, and when they work together can make things even more complicated. Despite a great amount of efforts devoted to understanding the behavior of trackers, reliable and quantifiable ways for studying the per factor tracking behavior remain barely available. Addressing this issue, in this paper we contribute to the community a tracking diagnosis toolkit, TracKlinic, for diagnosis of challenge factors of tracking algorithms. TracKlinic consists of two novel components focusing on the data and analysis aspects, respectively. For the data component, we carefully prepare a set of 2,390 annotated videos, each involving one and only one major challenge factor. When analyzing an algorithm for a specific challenge factor, such one-factor-per-sequence rule greatly inhibits the disturbance from other factors and consequently leads to more faithful analysis. For the analysis component, given the tracking results on all sequences, it investigates the behavior of the tracker under each individual factor and generates the report automatically. With TracKlinic, a thorough study is conducted on ten state-of-the-art trackers on nine challenge factors (including two compound ones). The results suggest that, heavy shape variation and occlusion are the two most challenging factors faced by most trackers. Besides, out-of-view, though does not happen frequently, is often fatal. By sharing TracKlinic, we expect to make it much easier for diagnosing tracking algorithms, and to thus facilitate developing better ones."}

They do not generalize well when applied on distance estimation for complex projection models such as in fisheye and omnidirectional cameras. This paper introduces a novel multi-task learning strategy to improve self-supervised monocular distance estimation on fisheye and pinhole camera images. Our contribution to this work is threefold: Firstly, we introduce a novel distance estimation network architecture using a self-attention based encoder coupled with robust semantic feature guidance to the decoder that can be trained in a one-stage fashion. Secondly, we integrate a generalized robust loss function, which improves performance significantly while removing the need for hyperparameter tuning with the reprojection loss. Finally, we reduce the artifacts caused by dynamic objects violating static world assumptions using a semantic masking strategy. We significantly improve upon the RMSE of previous work on fisheye by a 25% reduction in RMSE. As there is little work on fisheye cameras, we evaluated the proposed method on KITTI using a pinhole model. We achieved state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised methods without requiring an external scale estimation."}

To facilitate this, we introduce a Styling Network that has the capability to learn style characteristics of each domain represented in the training dataset. The Styling Network helps the generator to drive the translation of images from a source domain to a reference domain and generate synthetic images with style characteristics of the reference domain. The learned style characteristics for each domain depend on both the style loss and domain classification loss. This induces variability in style characteristics within each domain. The proposed CIT-GAN is used in the context of iris presentation attack detection (PAD) to generate synthetic presentation attack (PA) samples for classes that are under-represented in the training set. Evaluation using current state-of-the-art iris PAD methods demonstrates the efficacy of using such synthetically generated PA samples for training PAD methods. Further, the quality of the synthetically generated samples is evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score. Results show that the quality of synthetic images generated by the proposed method is superior to that of other competing methods, including StarGan."}

Four of such cameras form a surround-view system that provides a complete and detailed view of the vehicle. These cameras are directly exposed to harsh environmental settings and can get soiled very easily by mud, dust, water, frost. Soiling on the camera lens can severely degrade the visual perception algorithms, and a camera cleaning system triggered by a soiling detection algorithm is increasingly being deployed. While adverse weather conditions, such as rain, are getting attention recently, there is only limited work on general soiling. The main reason is the difficulty in collecting a diverse dataset as it is a relatively rare event. We propose a novel GAN based algorithm for generating unseen patterns of soiled images. Additionally, the proposed method automatically provides the corresponding soiling masks eliminating the manual annotation cost. Augmentation of the generated soiled images for training improves the accuracy of soiling detection tasks significantly by 18% demonstrating its usefulness. The manually annotated soiling dataset and the generated augmentation dataset will be made public. We demonstrate the generalization of our fisheye trained GAN model on the Cityscapes dataset.

In this work we address these challenges with QuadroNet, a one-shot network that jointly produces four outputs: 2D detections, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimates in real-time (>60fps) on consumer-grade GPU hardware. On a challenging real-world autonomous driving dataset, we demonstrate an increase of +2.4% mAP for detection, +3.15% mIoU for semantic segmentation, +5.05% mAP@0.5 for instance segmentation and +1.36% in delta<1.25 for depth prediction over a baseline approach.

In video understanding, temporal information is at the core of many current challenges, including compression, efficient inference, motion estimation or summarization. However, in current video datasets it has been observed that action classes can often be recognized without any temporal information, from a single frame of video. As a result, both benchmarking and training in these datasets may give an unintentional advantage to models with strong image understanding capabilities, as opposed to those with strong temporal understanding, potentially hindering progress. In this paper we address this problem head on by identifying action classes where temporal information is actually necessary to recognize them and call these \"temporal classes\". Selecting temporal classes using a computational method would bias the process. Instead, we propose a methodology based on a simple and effective human annotation experiment. We remove just the temporal information, by shuffling frames in time, and measure if the action can still be recognized. Classes that cannot be recognized when frames are not in order, are included in the temporal set. We observe that this set is statistically different from other static classes, and that performance in it correlates with a network's ability to capture temporal information. Thus we use it as a benchmark on current popular networks, which reveals a series of interesting facts, like inflated convolutions bias networks towards classes where motion is not important. We also explore the effect of training on the temporal set, and observe that this leads to better generalization in unseen classes, demonstrating the need for more temporal data. We hope that the proposed dataset of temporal categories will help guide future research in temporal modeling for better video understanding."}

However, for real-world low-resolution images (e.g. images captured straight from the camera) they often generate blurry images and highlight unpleasant artifacts. The main reason is the training data that does not reflect the real-world super-resolution problem. They train the network using images downsampled with an ideal (usually bicubic) kernel. However, for real-world images the degradation process is more complex and can vary from image to image. This paper proposes a new dual-path architecture (DualSR) that learns an image-specific low-to-high resolution mapping using only patches of the input test image. For every image, a downsampler learns the degradation process using a generative adversarial network, and an upsampler learns to super-resolve that specific image. In the DualSR architecture, the upsampler and downsampler are trained simultaneously and they improve each other using cycle consistency losses. For better visual quality and eliminating undesired artifacts, the upsampler is constrained by a masked interpolation loss. On standard benchmarks with unknown degradation kernels, DualSR outperforms recent blind and non-blind super-resolution methods in term of SSIM and generates images with higher perceptual quality. On real-world LR images it generates visually pleasing and artifact-free results."}

The typical audio-based VAD systems can be ineffective in the presence of ambient noise or noise variations. Moreover, due to technical or privacy reasons, audio might not be always available. In such cases, the use of video modality to perform VAD is desirable. Almost all existing visual VAD methods rely on body part detection, e.g., face, lips, or hands. In contrast, we propose a novel visual VAD method operating directly on the entire video frame, without the explicit need of detecting a person or his/her body parts. Our method, named S-VVAD, learns body motion cues associated with speech activity within a weakly supervised segmentation framework. Therefore, it not only detects the speakers/not-speakers but simultaneously localizes the image positions of them. It is an end-to-end pipeline, person-independent and it does not require any prior knowledge nor pre-processing. S-VVAD performs well in various challenging conditions and demonstrates the state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets. Moreover, the better generalization capability of S-VVAD is confirmed for cross-dataset and person-independent scenarios."}

This paper introduces a new vision task where various entities share task-specific image data to enlarge each other's training data volume without visually disclosing sensitive contents (e.g. illegal images). Then, we present a new structure-based training regime to enable different entities learn task-specific and reconstruction-proof image representations for image data sharing. Specifically, each entity learns a private Deep Poisoning Module (DPM) and insert it to a pre-trained deep network, which is designed to perform the specific vision task. The DPM deliberately poisons convolutional image features to prevent image reconstructions, while ensuring that the altered image data is functionally equivalent to the non-poisoned data for the specific vision task. Given this equivalence, the poisoned features shared from one entity could be used by another entity for further model refinement. Experimental results on image classification prove the efficacy of the proposed method."}

However, unlike RGB images captured by a camera, the semantic information from the radar signals is noticeably difficult to extract. In this paper, we propose a deep radar object detection network (RODNet), to effectively detect objects purely from the carefully processed radar frequency data in the format of range-azimuth frequency heatmaps (RAMaps). Three different 3D autoencoder based architectures are introduced to predict object confidence distribution from each snippet of the input RAMaps. The final detection results are then calculated using our post-processing method, called location-based non-maximum suppression (L-NMS). Instead of using burdensome human-labeled ground truth, we train the RODNet using the annotations generated automatically by a novel 3D localization method using a camera-radar fusion (CRF) strategy. To train and evaluate our method, we build a new dataset -- CRUW, containing synchronized videos and RAMaps in various driving scenarios. After intensive experiments, our RODNet shows favorable object detection performance without the presence of the camera."}

Unfortunately some issues persists, in particular when blending the missing pixels with the visible ones. We address the problem by proposing a Wasserstein GAN combined with a new reverse mask operator, namely Reverse Masking Network (R-MNet), a perceptual adversarial network for image inpainting. The reverse mask operator transfers the reverse masked image to the end of the encoder-decoder network leaving only valid pixels to be inpainted. Additionally, we propose a new loss function computed in feature space to target only valid pixels combined with adversarial training. These then capture data distributions and generate images similar to those in the training data with achieved realism (realistic and coherent) on the output images. We evaluate our method on publicly available dataset, and compare with state-of-the-art methods.

{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2021", "Area": "CV", "Where": "WACV", "Abbreviation": "G2D", "Title": "Generate to Detect Anomaly", "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel method for irregularity detection. Previous researches solve this problem as a One-Class Classification (OCC) task where they train a reference model on all of the available samples. Then, they consider a test sample as an anomaly if it has a diversion from the reference model. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved the most promising results for OCC while implementing and training such networks, especially for the OCC task, is a cumbersome and computationally expensive procedure. To cope with the mentioned challenges, we present a simple but effective method to solve the irregularity detection as a binary classification task in order to make the implementation easier along with improving the detection performance. We learn two deep neural networks (generator and discriminator) in a GAN-style setting on merely the normal samples. During training, the generator gradually becomes an expert to generate samples which are similar to the normal ones. In the training phase, when the generator fails to produce normal data (in the early stages of learning and also prior to the complete convergence), it can be considered as an irregularity generator. In this way, we simultaneously generate the irregular samples. Afterward, we train a binary classifier on the generated anomalous samples along with the normal instances in order to be capable of detecting irregularities. The proposed framework applies to different related applications of outlier and anomaly detection in images and videos, respectively. The results confirm that our proposed method is superior to the baseline and state-of-the-art solutions."}

Most recent works treat the human pose synthesis tasks as an image spatial transformation problem using flow warping techniques. However, we observe that, due to the inherent ill-posed nature of many complicated human poses, former methods fail to generate body parts. To tackle this problem, we propose a feature-level flow attention module and an Enhancer Network. The flow attention module produces a flow attention mask to guide the combination of the flow-warped features and the structural pose features. Then, we apply the Enhancer Network to refine the coarse image by injecting the pose information. We present our experimental evaluation both qualitatively and quantitatively on DeepFashion, Market-1501, and Youtube dance datasets. Quantitative results show that our method has 12.995 FID at DeepFashion, 25.459 FID at Market-1501, 14.516 FID at Youtube dance datasets, which outperforms some state-of-the-arts including Guide-Pixe2Pixe, Global-Flow-Local-Attn, and CocosNet."}

They have reduced model sizes and allow for efficient inference on mobile or embedded devices with limited power and computational resources. However, the binarization of weights and activations leads to feature maps of lower quality and lower capacity and thus a drop in accuracy compared to their 32-bit counterparts. Previous work has increased the number of channels or used multiple binary bases to alleviate these problems. In this paper, we instead present an architectural approach: MeliusNet. It consists of alternating a DenseBlock, which increases the feature capacity, and our proposed ImprovementBlock, which increases the feature quality. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our MeliusNet over a variety of popular binary architectures with regards to both computation savings and accuracy. Furthermore, BNN models trained with our method can match the accuracy of the popular compact network MobileNet-v1 in terms of model size and number of operations."}

These methods are unsupervised and are used to perform low-level vision tasks such as image restoration, image editing, and image synthesis. In this work, we proposed a new training data-independent framework, called Deep Contextual Features Learning (DeepCFL), to perform image synthesis and image restoration based on the semantics of the input image. The contextual features are simply the high dimensional vectors representing the semantics of the given image. DeepCFL is a single image GAN framework that learns the distribution of the context vectors from the input image. We show the performance of contextual learning in various challenging scenarios: outpainting, inpainting, and restoration of randomly removed pixels. DeepCFL is applicable when the input source image and the generated target image are not aligned. We illustrate image synthesis using DeepCFL for the task of image resizing."}

An adversarial attack or defense algorithm may show better results on the reported dataset than can be replicated on other datasets. Even when two algorithms are compared, their relative performance can vary depending on the dataset. Deep learning offers state-of-the-art solutions for image recognition, but deep models are vulnerable even to small perturbations. Research in this area focuses primarily on adversarial attacks and defense algorithms. In this paper, we report for the first time, a class of robust images that are both resilient to attacks and that recover better than random images under adversarial attacks using simple defense techniques. Thus, a test dataset with a high proportion of robust images gives a misleading impression about the performance of an adversarial attack or defense. We propose three metrics to determine the proportion of robust images in a dataset and provide scoring to determine the dataset bias. We also provide an ImageNet-R dataset of 15000+ robust images to facilitate further research on this intriguing phenomenon of image strength under attack. Our dataset, combined with the proposed metrics, is valuable for unbiased benchmarking of adversarial attack and defense algorithms."}

To this end, DANCE applies two new designs: attentive contour deformation to refine the quality of segmentation contours and segment-wise matching to ease the model training. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DANCE excels at deforming the initial contour in a more natural and efficient way towards the real object boundaries. Effectiveness of DANCE is also validated on the COCO dataset, which achieves 38.1% mAP and outperforms all other contour-based instance segmentation models. To the best of our knowledge, DANCE is the first contour-based model that achieves comparable performance to pixel-wise segmentation models. Code is available at https://github.com/lkevinzc/dance."}

Since many defects occur very rarely and their characteristics are mostly unknown a priori, their detection is still an open research question. To this end, we propose DifferNet: It leverages the descriptiveness of features extracted by convolutional neural networks to estimate their density using normalizing flows. Normalizing flows are well-suited to deal with low dimensional data distributions. However, they struggle with the high dimensionality of images. Therefore, we employ a multi-scale feature extractor which enables the normalizing flow to assign meaningful likelihoods to the images. Based on these likelihoods we develop a scoring function that indicates defects. Moreover, propagating the score back to the image enables pixel-wise localization. To achieve a high robustness and performance we exploit multiple transformations in training and evaluation. In contrast to most other methods, ours does not require a large number of training samples and performs well with as low as 16 images. We demonstrate the superior performance over existing approaches on the challenging and newly proposed MVTec AD and Magnetic Tile Defects datasets."}

This makes representation of rare words very difficult and out-of-vocabulary words impossible. Moreover, to avoid computational complexity, existing IC models operate over a modest sized vocabulary of frequent words, such that the identity of rare words is lost. In this work we address this common limitation of IC systems in dealing with rare words in the corpora. We decompose words into smaller constituent units `subwords' and represent captions as a sequence of subwords instead of words. This helps represent all words in the corpora using a significantly lower subword vocabulary, leading to better parameter learning. Using subword language modeling, our captioning system improves various metric scores, with a training vocabulary size approximately 90% less than the baseline and various state-of-the-art word-level models. Our quantitative and qualitative results and analysis signify the efficacy of our proposed approach."}

Analyzing watermark removal helps to reinforce the anti-attack techniques in an adversarial way. Current removal methods normally leverage image-to-image translation techniques. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of the size, shape, color and transparency of the watermarks set a huge barrier for these methods. To combat this, we combine traditional watermarked image decomposition into a two-stage generator, called Watermark-Decomposition Network (WDNet), where the first stage predicts a rough decomposition from the whole watermarked image and the second stage specifically centers on the watermarked area to refine the removal results. The decomposition formulation enables WDNet to separate watermarks from the images rather than simply removing them. We further show that these separated watermarks can serve as extra nutrients for building a larger training dataset and further improving removal performance. Besides, we construct a large-scale dataset named CLWD, which mainly contains colored watermarks, to fill the vacuum of colored watermark removal dataset. Extensive experiments on the public gray-scale dataset LVW and CLWD consistently show that the proposed WDNet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches both in accuracy and efficiency."}

Therefore, detecting anomalies in drivers' actions (i.e., any action deviating from normal driving) contains the utmost importance to reduce driver-related accidents. However, there are unbounded many anomalous actions that a driver can do while driving, which leads to an `open set recognition' problem. Accordingly, instead of recognizing a set of anomalous actions that are commonly defined by previous dataset providers, in this work, we propose a contrastive learning approach to learn a metric to differentiate normal driving from anomalous driving. For this task, we introduce a new video-based benchmark, the Driver Anomaly Detection (DAD) dataset, which contains normal driving videos together with a set of anomalous actions in its training set. In the test set of the DAD dataset, there are unseen anomalous actions that still need to be winnowed out from normal driving. Our method reaches 0.9673 AUC on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the contrastive learning approach on the anomaly detection task.

MECCANO has been acquired by 20 participants who were asked to build a motorbike model, for which they had to interact with tiny objects and tools. The dataset has been explicitly labeled for the task of recognizing human-object interactions from an egocentric perspective. Specifically, each interaction has been labeled both temporally (with action segments) and spatially (with active object bounding boxes). With the proposed dataset, we investigate four different tasks including 1) action recognition, 2) active object detection, 3) active object recognition and 4) egocentric human-object interaction detection, which is a revisited version of the standard human-object interaction detection task. Baseline results show that the MECCANO dataset is a challenging benchmark to study egocentric human-object interactions in industrial-like scenarios.

Our system SHAD3S attempts to compete with a human at hatching generic three-dimensional (3D) shapes, and also tries to assist her in a form exploration exercise. The novelty of our approach lies in the fact that we make no assumptions about the input other than that it represents a 3D shape, and yet, given a contextual information of illumination and texture, we synthesise an accurate hatch pattern over the sketch, without access to 3d or pseudo 3D. In the process, we contribute towards a) a cheap yet effective method to synthesise a sufficiently large high fidelity dataset, pertinent to task; b) creating a pipeline with conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN); and c) creating an interactive utility with GIMP, that is a tool for artists to engage with automated hatching or a form-exploration exercise. User evaluation of the tool suggests that the model performance does generalise satisfactorily over diverse input, both in terms of style as well as shape. A simple comparison of inception scores suggest that the generated distribution is as diverse as the ground truth.k"}

Instruments and sensors useful for flood detection are only available in low resolution, low latency satellites with region re-visit periods of up to 16 days, making flood alerting systems that use such satellites unreliable. This work presents H2O-Network, a self supervised deep learning method to segment floods from satellites and aerial imagery by bridging domain gap between low and high latency satellite and coarse-to-fine label refinement. H2O-Net learns to synthesize signals highly correlative with water presence as a domain adaptation step for semantic segmentation in high resolution satellite imagery. Our work also proposes a self-supervision mechanism, which does not require any hand annotation, used during training to generate high quality ground truth data. We demonstrate that H2O-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods on satellite imagery by 10% and 12% pixel accuracy and mIoU respectively for the task of flood segmentation. We emphasize the generalizability of our model by transferring model weights trained on satellite imagery to drone imagery, a highly different sensor and domain."}

However, acquiring such large-scale data sets with precise annotations is very expensive and time-consuming, and the cheap alternatives often yield data sets that have noisy labels. The field has addressed this problem by focusing on training models under two types of label noise: 1) closed-set noise, where some training samples are incorrectly annotated to a training label other than their known true class; and 2) open-set noise, where the training set includes samples that possess a true class that is (strictly) not contained in the set of known training labels. In this work, we study a new variant of the noisy label problem that combines the open-set and closed-set noisy labels, and introduce a benchmark evaluation to assess the performance of training algorithms under this setup. We argue that such problem is more general and better reflects the noisy label scenarios in practice. Furthermore, we propose a novel algorithm, called EvidentialMix, that addresses this problem and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art methods for both closed-set and open-set noise on the proposed benchmark. Our results show that our method produces superior classification results and better feature representations than previous state-of-the-art methods.

This challenge is further aggravated by densely distributed actions in untrimmed videos. Previous action detection methods are failing in selecting the key temporal information in videos of long length. To this end, we introduce the Dilated Attention Layer (DAL). Compared to previous temporal convolution layer, DAL allocates attentional weights to each feature in the kernel, which enables DAL to learn better local representation across time. Furthermore, DAL when accompanied by dilated kernels is able to learn a global representation of several minutes long videos which is crucial for the task of action detection. Finally, we introduce Pyramid Dilated Attention Network (PDAN) which is build upon DAL. With the help of DAL combining with dilation and residual links, PDAN can model short-term and long-term temporal relations simultaneously by focusing on local segments at the level of low and high temporal receptive fields. This property enables PDAN to handle complex temporal relations between different action instances in long untrimmed videos. To corroborate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method, we evaluate it on three densely annotated, multi-label datasets: MultiTHUMOS, Charades and an Inhouse dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art results."}

Automatically reading the chart values is a key step for chart content understanding. Charts have a lot of variations in style (e.g. bar chart, line chart, pie chart and etc.), which makes pure rule-based data extraction methods difficult to handle. However, it is also improper to directly apply end-to-end deep learning solutions since these methods usually deal with specific types of charts. In this paper, we propose an unified method ChartOCR to extract data from various types of charts. We show that by combing deep framework and rule-based methods, we can achieve a satisfying generalization ability and obtain accurate and semantic-rich intermediate results. Our method extracts the key points that define the chart components. By adjusting the prior rules, the framework can be applied to different chart types. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with fast processing speed on two public datasets.

In FCNNs, the encoder plays an integral role by learning both global and local features and contextual representations which can be utilized for semantic output prediction by the decoder. Despite their success, the locality of convolutional layers in FCNNs, limits the capability of learning long-range spatial dependencies. Inspired by the recent success of transformers for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in long-range sequence learning, we reformulate the task of volumetric (3D) medical image segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem. We introduce a novel architecture, dubbed as UNEt TRansformers (UNETR), that utilizes a transformer as the encoder to learn sequence representations of the input volume and effectively capture the global multi-scale information, while also following the successful \"U-shaped\" network design for the encoder and decoder. The transformer encoder is directly connected to a decoder via skip connections at different resolutions to compute the final semantic segmentation output. We have validated the performance of our method on the Multi Atlas Labeling Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV) dataset for multi-organ segmentation and the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset for brain tumor and spleen segmentation tasks. Our benchmarks demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance on the BTCV leaderboard."}

Due to the high cost of commonly used LiDAR sensor, stereo vision based 3D detection, as an economical yet effective setting, attracts more attention recently. For these approaches based on 2D images, accurate depth information is the key to achieve 3D detection, and most existing methods resort to a preliminary stage for depth estimation. They mainly focus on the global depth and neglect the property of depth information in this specific task, namely, sparsity and locality, where exactly accurate depth is only needed for these 3D bounding boxes. Motivated by this finding, we propose a stereo-image based anchor-free 3D detection method, called structure-aware stereo 3D detector (termed as SIDE), where we explore the instance-level depth information via constructing the cost volume from RoIs of each object. Due to the information sparsity of local cost volume, we further introduce match reweighting and structure-aware attention, to make the depth information more concentrated. Experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods without depth map supervision."}

Such models learn piecewise linear mappings, where each piece handles a subset of the input space, and the gradients per subset are piecewise constant. Under such a class of discriminator (or critic) functions, we present Gradient Normalization (GraN), a novel input-dependent normalization method, which guarantees a piecewise K-Lipschitz constraint in the input space. In contrast to spectral normalization, GraN does not constrain processing at the individual network layers, and, unlike gradient penalties, strictly enforces a piecewise Lipschitz constraint almost everywhere. Empirically, we demonstrate improved image generation performance across multiple datasets (incl. CIFAR-10/100, STL-10, LSUN bedrooms, and CelebA), GAN loss functions, and metrics. Further, we analyze altering the often untuned Lipschitz constant K in several standard GANs, not only attaining significant performance gains, but also finding connections between K and training dynamics, particularly in low-gradient loss plateaus, with the common Adam optimizer."}

However, these RGB-trained models suffer a performance drop under adverse illumination and lighting conditions. Infrared (IR) cameras are robust under such conditions and can be helpful in real-world applications. Though thermal cameras are widely used for military applications and increasingly for commercial applications, there is a lack of robust algorithms to robustly exploit the thermal imagery due to the limited availability of labeled thermal data. In this work, we aim to enhance the object detection performance in the thermal domain by leveraging the labeled visible domain data in an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) setting. We propose an algorithm agnostic meta-learning framework to improve existing UDA methods instead of proposing a new UDA strategy. We achieve this by meta-learning the initial condition of the detector, which facilitates the adaptation process with fine updates without overfitting or getting stuck at local optima. However, meta-learning the initial condition for the detection scenario is computationally heavy due to long and intractable computation graphs. Therefore, we propose an online meta-learning paradigm which performs online updates resulting in a short and tractable computation graph. To this end, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over many baselines in the UDA setting, producing a state-of-the-art thermal detector for the KAIST and DSIAC datasets. Source code will be made publicly available after the review process."}

In this paper, we attempt to solve a parametric NBD problem, inspired by the simultaneous acquisition of ptychography and fluorescent imaging (FI). Ptychography is an imaging method that favors larger probes, i.e. convolutional kernels, while FI relies on a small probe for high resolution. Also, the kernel can be solved during ptychographic reconstruction. With Ptycho-FI using the same larger kernel, we can perform NBD on the blurred fluorescent images to achieve high-resolution FI, and thus speed up the experiments. To this end, we design a deep latent space deformation network that is directly parameterized by the kernel. The network consists of three components: encoder, deformer, and decoder, where the deformer is specifically meant to rectify the latent space representations of blurred images to a standard latent space, regardless of the kernel. The deformation network is trained with a two-stage training scheme. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm that our parametric model can adapt to drastically different blurring kernels and perform robust deblurring."}

In this paper, we introduce the Stereo Bird's Eye ViewNetwork (SBEVNet), a novel supervised end-to-end framework for estimation of bird's eye view layout from a pair of stereo images. Although our network reuses some of the building blocks from the state-of-the-art deep learning networks for disparity estimation, we show that explicit depth estimation is neither sufficient nor necessary. Instead, the learning of a good internal bird's eye view feature representation is effective for layout estimation. Specifically, we first generate a disparity feature volume using the features of the stereo images and then project it to the bird's eye view coordinates. This gives us coarse-grained information about the scene structure. We also apply inverse perspective mapping (IPM) to map the input images and their features to the bird's eye view. This gives us fine-grained texture information. Concatenating IPM features with the projected feature volume creates a rich bird's eye view representation which is useful for spatial reasoning. We use this representation to estimate the BEV semantic map. Additionally, we show that using the IPM features as a supervisory signal for stereo features can give an improvement in performance. We demonstrate our approach on two datasets:the KITTI dataset and a synthetically generated dataset from the CARLA simulator. For both of these datasets, we establish state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline techniques."}

They allow for CNN visualization and interpretation without training on fully annotated image datasets. CAM methods are typically integrated within off-the-shelf CNN backbones, such as ResNet50. Due to convolution and pooling operations, these backbones yield low resolution CAMs with a down-scaling factor of up to 32, contributing to inaccurate localizations. Interpolation is required to restore full size CAMs, yet it does not consider the statistical properties of objects, such as color and texture, leading to activations with inconsistent boundaries, and inaccurate localizations. As an alternative, we introduce a generic method for parametric upscaling of CAMs that allows constructing accurate full resolution CAMs (F-CAMs). In particular, we propose a trainable decoding architecture that can be connected to any CNN classifier to produce highly accurate CAM localizations. Given an original low resolution CAM, foreground and background pixels are randomly sampled to fine-tune the decoder. Additional priors such as image statistics and size constraints are also considered to expand and refine object boundaries. Extensive experiments, over three CNN backbones and six WSOL baselines on the CUB-200-2011 and OpenImages datasets, indicate that our F-CAM method yields a significant improvement in CAM localization accuracy. F-CAM performance is competitive with state-of-art WSOL methods, yet it requires fewer computations during inference."}

In high-stakes situations such as healthcare, there is a need for explainable AI (XAI) tools that can help open up this black box. In contrast to approaches which largely tackle classification problems in the medical imaging domain, we address the less-studied problem of explainable image retrieval. We test our approach on a COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset and the ISIC 2017 skin lesion dataset, showing that saliency maps help reveal the image features used by models to determine image similarity. We evaluated three different saliency algorithms, which were either occlusion-based, attention-based, or relied on a form of activation mapping. We also develop quantitative evaluation metrics that allow us to go beyond simple qualitative comparisons of the different saliency algorithms.

Existing works have simultaneously justified the efficacy of dilated and deformable convolutions for various image-level segmentation tasks. This gives reason to believe that 3D extensions of such convolutions should also yield performance improvements for video-level segmentation tasks. However, this aspect has not yet been explored thoroughly in existing literature. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Dilated Convolutions (D2Conv3D): a novel type of convolution which draws inspiration from dilated and deformable convolutions and extends them to the 3D (spatio-temporal) domain. We experimentally show that D2Conv3D can be used to improve the performance of multiple 3D CNN architectures across multiple video segmentation related benchmarks by simply employing D2Conv3D as a drop-in replacement for standard convolutions. We further show that D2Conv3D out-performs trivial extensions of existing dilated and deformable convolutions to 3D.

Towards the goal of improving the performance of semi-supervised learning methods, we propose a novel framework, HIERMATCH, a semi-supervised approach that leverages hierarchical information to reduce labeling costs and performs as well as a vanilla semi-supervised learning method. Hierarchical information is often available as prior knowledge in the form of coarse labels (e.g., woodpeckers) for images with fine-grained labels (e.g., downy woodpeckers or golden-fronted woodpeckers). However, the use of supervision using coarse-category labels to improve semi-supervised techniques has not been explored. In the absence of fine-grained labels, HIERMATCH exploits the label hierarchy and uses coarse class labels as a weak supervisory signal. Additionally, HIERMATCH is a generic-approach to improve any semi-supervised learning framework, we demonstrate this using our results on recent state-of-the-art techniques MixMatch and FixMatch. We evaluate the efficacy of HIERMATCH on two benchmark datasets, namely CIFAR-100 and NABirds. HIERMATCH can reduce the usage of fine-grained labels by 50% on CIFAR-100 with only a marginal drop of 0.59% in top-1 accuracy as compared to MixMatch."}

As mask occludes most prominent facial characteristics, it brings new challenges to the existing facial recognition systems. This paper presents an idea to consider forehead creases (under surprise facial expression) as a new biometric modality to authenticate mask-wearing faces. The forehead biometrics utilizes the creases and textural skin patterns appearing due to voluntary contraction of the forehead region as features. The proposed framework is an efficient and generalizable deep learning framework for forehead recognition. Face-selfie images are collected using smartphone's frontal camera in an unconstrained environment with various indoor/outdoor realistic environments. Acquired forehead images are first subjected to a segmentation model that results in rectangular Region Of Interest (ROI's). A set of convolutional feature maps are subsequently obtained using a backbone network. The primary embeddings are enriched using a dual attention network (DANet) to induce discriminative feature learning. The attention-empowered embeddings are then optimized using Large Margin Cosine Loss (LMCL) followed by Focal Loss to update weights for inducting robust training and better feature discriminating capabilities. Our system is end-to-end and few-shot; thus, it is very efficient in memory requirements and recognition rate. Besides, we present a forehead image dataset that has been recorded in two sessions from 247 subjects containing a total of 4,964 selfie-face mask images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to date mobile-based forehead dataset and is being made available along with the mobile application in the public domain.

However, recording binaural audio requires specialized setup with a dummy human head having microphones in left and right ears. Such a recording setup is difficult to build and setup, therefore mono audio has become the preferred choice in common devices. To obtain the same impact as binaural audio, recent efforts have been directed towards lifting mono audio to binaural audio conditioned on the visual input from the scene. Such approaches have not used an important cue for the task: the distance of different sound producing objects from the microphones. In this work, we argue that depth map of the scene can act as a proxy for inducing distance information of different objects in the scene, for the task of audio binauralization. We propose a novel encoder-decoder architecture with a hierarchical attention mechanism to encode image, depth and audio feature jointly.

One such exciting application is Shadow Art - a unique form of sculptural art that produces artistic effects through 2D shadows cast by a 3D sculpture. In this work, we revisit shadow art using differentiable rendering-based optimization frameworks to obtain the 3D sculpture from a set of shadow (binary) images and their corresponding projection information. Specifically, we discuss shape optimization through voxel as well as mesh-based differentiable renderers. Our choice of using differentiable rendering for generating shadow art sculptures can be attributed to its ability to learn the underlying 3D geometry solely from image data, thus reducing the dependence on 3D ground truth. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework in generating complex 3D sculptures that transcend the ones seen in contemporary art pieces using just a set of shadow images as input. Further, we demonstrate the generation of 3D sculptures to cast shadows of faces, animated movie characters, and the applicability of the proposed framework to sketch-based 3D reconstruction of the underlying shapes."}

However, scene understanding of human exceeds recognizing individual objects separately: the contextual information among multiple objects such as visual relational information (e.g. visually similar objects) and semantic relational information (e.g. co-occurrences) is helpful for understanding of visual scene. In this paper, we verify that contextual information plays a more important role in ZSD than in traditional object detection. To make full use of such information, we propose a new end-to-end ZSD method GRaph Aligning Network (GRAN) based on graph modeling and reasoning which simultaneously considers visual and semantic information of multiple objects instead of individual objects. Specifically, we formulate a Visual Relational Graph (VRG) and a Semantic Relational Graph (SRG), where the nodes are the objects in the image and the semantic representations of classes respectively and the edges are the relevance between nodes in each graph. To characterize mutual effect between two modalities, the two graphs are further merged into a heterogeneous Visual-Semantic Relational Graph (VSRG), where modal translators are designed for the two subgraphs to enable modal information to transform into a common space for communication, and message passing among nodes is enforced to refine their representations. Comprehensive experiments on MSCOCO dataset demonstrate the advantage of our method over state-of-the-arts, and qualitative analysis suggests the validity of using contextual information."}

By using superpixel representation, the number of image primitives can be largely reduced by orders of magnitudes. The majority of superpixel methods use handcrafted features, which usually do not translate well into strong adherence to object boundaries. A few recent superpixel methods have introduced deep learning into the superpixel segmentation process. However, none of these methods is able to produce superpixels in near real-time, which is crucial to the applicability of a superpixel method in practice. In this work, we propose a two-stage graph-based framework for superpixel segmentation. In the first stage, we introduce an efficient Deep Affinity Learning (DAL) network that learns pairwise pixel affinities by aggregating multi-scale information. In the second stage, we propose a highly efficient superpixel method called Hierarchical Entropy Rate Segmentation (HERS). Using the learned affinities from the first stage, HERS builds a hierarchical tree structure that can produce any number of highly adaptive superpixels instantaneously.

Despite efforts to disentangle the attributes, a request to change one attribute often triggers unwanted changes to other attributes as well. More importantly, in some cases, a human observer would not recognize the edited face to belong to the same person. We propose an approach where a neural network takes as input the latent encoding of a face and the desired attribute changes and outputs the latent space encoding of the edited image. The network is trained offline using unsupervised data, with training labels generated by an off-the-shelf attribute classifier. The desired attribute changes and conservation laws, such as identity maintenance, are encoded in the training loss. The number of attributes the mapper can simultaneously modify is only limited by the attributes available to the classifier -- we trained a network that handles 35 attributes, more than any previous approach. As no optimization is performed at deployment time, the computation time is negligible, allowing real-time attribute editing. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with the current state-of-the-art show our method is better at conserving the identity of the face and restricting changes to the requested attributes."}

Compared to parameter sparsity, feature map sparsity is per-input related which has better adaptability. The practical sparsity patterns are non-structural and randomly located on feature maps with non-identical shapes. However, the existing feature map sparsity works take computing efficiency as the primary goal, thereby they can only remove structural sparsity and fail to match the above characteristics. In this paper, we develop a novel sparsity computing scheme called FalCon, which can well adapt to the practical sparsity patterns while still maintaining efficient computing. Specifically, we first propose a decomposed convolution design that enables a fine-grained computing unit for sparsity. Additionally, a decomposed convolution computing optimization paradigm is proposed to convert the sparse computing units to practical acceleration. Extensive experiments show that FalCon achieves at most 67.30% theoretical computation reduction with a neglected accuracy drop while accelerating CNN inference by 37%."}

To validate the quality of synthesis, we train segmentation networks on a dataset augmented with the synthetic data, substantially improving the segmentation over the baseline."}

However, real images often vary in their degradation kernels, thus a single kernel-specific SR approach does not often produce accurate HR results. Recently, degradation-aware networks are introduced to generate blind SR results for unknown kernel conditions. They can restore images for multiple blur kernels, however they have to compromise in quality compared to their kernel-specific counterparts. To address this issue, we propose a novel blind SR method called Mixture of Experts Super-Resolution (MoESR), which uses different experts for different degradation kernels. A broad space of degradation kernels is covered by kernel-specific SR networks (experts). We present an accurate kernel prediction method (gating mechanism) by evaluating the sharpness of images generated by experts. Based on the predicted kernel our most suited expert network is selected for the input image. Finally, we fine-tune the selected network on the test image itself to leverage the advantage of internal learning. Our experimental results on standard synthetic datasets and real images demonstrate that MoESR outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Especially for the challenging x4 SR task, our PSNR improvement of 0.93 dB on the DIV2KRK dataset is substantial."}

While previous approaches rely on convolutional neural networks, the proposed network LwPosr uses mixture of depthwise separable convolutional (DSC) and transformer encoder layers which are structured in two streams and three stages to provide fine-grained regression for predicting head poses. The quantitative and qualitative demonstration is provided to show that the proposed network is able to learn head poses efficiently while using less parameter space. Extensive ablations are conducted using three open-source datasets namely 300W-LP, AFLW2000, and BIWI datasets. To our knowledge, (1) LwPosr is the lightest network proposed for estimating head poses compared to both keypoints-based and keypoints-free approaches; (2) it sets a benchmark for both overperforming the previous lightweight network on mean absolute error and on reducing number of parameters; (3) it is first of its kind to use mixture of DSCs and transformer encoders for HPE. This approach is suitable for mobile devices which require lightweight networks."}

In this paper we show the benefits of including yet another stream based on human pose estimated from each frame --- specifically by rendering pose on input RGB frames. At first blush, this additional stream may seem redundant given that human pose is fully determined by RGB pixel values --- however we show (perhaps surprisingly) that this simple and flexible addition can provide complementary gains. Using this insight, we propose a new model, which we dub PERF-Net (short for Pose Empowered RGB-Flow Net), which combines this new pose stream with the standard RGB and flow based input streams via distillation techniques and show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin in a number of human action recognition datasets while not requiring flow or pose to be explicitly computed at inference time. The proposed pose stream is also part of the winner solution of the ActivityNet Kinetics Challenge 2020."}

These methods typically uniformly sample a segment of an input clip (along the temporal dimension). However, not all parts of a video are equally important to determine the action in the clip. In this work, we focus instead on learning where to extract features, so as to focus on the most informative parts of the video. We propose a method called the non-uniform temporal aggregation (NUTA), which aggregates features only from informative temporal segments. We also introduce a synchronization method that allows our NUTA features to be temporally aligned with traditional uniformly sampled video features, so that both local and clip-level features can be combined. Our model has achieved state-of-the-art performance on four widely used large-scale action-recognition datasets (Kinetics400, Kinetics700, Something-something V2 and Charades). In addition, we have created a visualization to illustrate how the proposed NUTA method selects only the most relevant parts of a video clip."}

To protect from such examples, various defense strategies have been proposed. A very recent defense strategy for detecting adversarial examples, that has been shown to be robust to current attacks, is to check for intrinsic context consistencies in the input data, where context refers to various relationships (e.g., object-to-object co-occurrence relationships) in images. In this paper, we show that even context consistency checks can be brittle to properly crafted adversarial examples and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do so. Specifically, we propose an adaptive framework to generate examples that subvert such defenses, namely, Adversarial attacks against object Detection that evade Context consistency checks (ADC). In ADC, we formulate a joint optimization problem which has two attack goals, viz., (i) fooling the object detector and (ii) evading the context consistency check system, at the same time. Experiments on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show that examples generated with ADC fool the object detector with a success rate of over 85% in most cases, and at the same time evade the recently proposed context consistency checks, with a bypassing rate of over 80% in most cases. Our results suggest that how to robustly model context and check its consistency, is still an open problem."}

One solution is to train a supervised deep neural network on many digital images and their smartphone-scanned versions. However, it requires a high labor cost, leading to limited training data. Previous works create training pairs by simulating degradation using low-level image processing techniques. Their synthetic images are then formed with perfectly scanned photos in latent space. Even so, the real-world degradation in smartphone photo scanning remains unsolved since it is more complicated due to lens defocus, low-cost cameras, losing details via printing. Besides, locally structural misalignment still occurs in data due to distorted shapes captured in a 3-D world, reducing restoration performance and the reliability of the quantitative evaluation. To address these problems, we propose a semi-supervised Deep Photo Scan (DPScan). First, we present a way of producing real-world degradation and provide the DIV2K-SCAN dataset for smartphone-scanned photo restoration. Also, Local Alignment is proposed to reduce the minor misalignment remaining in data. Second, we simulate many different variants of the real-world degradation using low-level image transformation to gain a generalization in smartphone-scanned image properties, then train a degradation network to generalize all styles of degradation and provide pseudo-scanned photos for unscanned images as if they were scanned by a smartphone. Finally, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning that allows our restoration network to be trained on both scanned and unscanned images, diversifying training image content. As a result, the proposed DPScan quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms its baseline architecture, state-of-the-art academic research, and industrial products in smartphone photo scanning."}

Different from other schemes which solely utilize the decoded RGB frames, MM-ViT operates exclusively in the compressed video domain and exploits all readily available modalities, i.e., I-frames, motion vectors, residuals and audio waveform. In order to handle the large number of spatiotemporal tokens extracted from multiple modalities, we develop several scalable model variants which factorize self-attention across the space, time and modality dimensions. In addition, to further explore the rich inter-modal interactions and their effects, we develop and compare three distinct cross-modal attention mechanisms that can be seamlessly integrated into the transformer building block. Extensive experiments on three public action recognition benchmarks (UCF-101,Something-Something-v2, Kinetics-600) demonstrate that MM-ViT outperforms the state-of-the-art video transformers in both efficiency and accuracy, and performs better or equally well to the state-of-the-art CNN counterparts with computationally-heavy optical flow"}

Its implementation is ubiquitous in all display devices and image processing software. In the last decade deep learning systems have been introduced for the task of image super-resolution (SR), using several convolutional layers and numerous filters. These methods have taken over the benchmarks of image quality for upscaling tasks. Would it be possible to replace classic upscalers with deep learning architectures on edge devices such as display panels, tablets, laptop computers, etc.? On one hand, the current trend in Edge-AI chips shows a promising future in this direction, with rapid development of hardware that can run deep-learning tasks efficiently. On the other hand, in image SR only few architectures have pushed the limit to extreme small sizes that can actually run on edge devices at real-time. We explore possible solutions to this problem with the aim to fill the gap between classic upscalers and small deep learning configurations. As a transition from classic to deep-learning upscaling we propose edge-SR (eSR), a set of one-layer architectures that use interpretable mechanisms to upscale images. Certainly, a one-layer architecture cannot reach the quality of deep learning systems. Nevertheless, we find that for high speed requirements, eSR becomes better at trading-off image quality and runtime performance. Filling the gap between classic and deep-learning architectures for image upscaling is critical for massive adoption of this technology. It is equally important to have an interpretable system that can reveal the inner strategies to solve this problem and guide us to future improvements and better understanding of larger networks."}

We describe a new methodology to train a style-based autoencoder where the encoder and generator are optimized end-to-end. We show that our proposed model consistently outperforms baselines in terms of image inversion and generation quality."}

However, these success stories are tainted by concerning reports on the lack of model transparency and bias against some medical conditions or patients' sub-groups. Explainable methods are considered the gateway to alleviate many of these concerns. In this study we demonstrate that the generated explanations are volatile to changes in model training that are perpendicular to the classification task and model structure. This raises further questions about trust in deep learning models for healthcare. Mainly, whether the models capture underlying causal links in the data or just rely on spurious correlations that are made visible via explanation methods. We demonstrate that the output of explainability methods on deep neural networks can vary significantly by changes of hyper-parameters, such as the random seed or how the training set is shuffled. We introduce a measure of explanation consistency which we use to highlight the identified problems on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. We find explanations of identical models but with different training setups have a low consistency: approximately 33% on average. On the contrary, kernel methods are robust against any orthogonal changes, with explanation consistency at 94%. We conclude that current trends in model explanation are not sufficient to mitigate the risks of deploying models in real life healthcare applications."}

Apart from backbone, training pipelines and loss functions, popular approaches have focused on different spatial pooling and attention mechanisms, which are at the core of learning a powerful global image representation. There are different forms of attention according to the interaction of elements of the feature tensor (local and global) and the dimensions where it is applied (spatial and channel). Unfortunately, each study addresses only one or two forms of attention and applies it to different problems like classification, detection or retrieval. We present global-local attention module (GLAM), which is attached at the end of a backbone network and incorporates all four forms of attention: local and global, spatial and channel. We obtain a new feature tensor and, by spatial pooling, we learn a powerful embedding for image retrieval. Focusing on global descriptors, we provide empirical evidence of the interaction of all forms of attention and improve the state of the art on standard benchmarks."}

Current hard parameter sharing methods for multi-task pixel-wise labeling use one shared encoder with separate decoders for each task. We generalize this notion and term the splitting of encoder-decoder architectures at different points as fission. Our ablation studies on fission show that sharing most of the decoder layers in multi-task encoder-decoder networks results in improvement while adding far fewer parameters per task. Our proposed method trains faster, uses less memory, results in better accuracy, and uses significantly fewer floating point operations (FLOPS) than conventional multi-task methods, with additional tasks only requiring 0.017% more FLOPS than the single-task network. We show results with a real-time model on a Pixel phone with released source code."}

In addition, we present a network for retrieving the shop images in this scenario, dubbed SEAM Match-RCNN. The model is trained by image-to-video domain adaptation, allowing to use video sequences where only their association with a shop image is given, eliminating the need of millions of annotated bounding boxes. SEAM Match-RCNN builds an embedding, where an attention-based weighted sum of few frames (10) of a social video is enough to individuate the correct product within the first 5 retrieved items in a 14K+ shop element gallery with an accuracy of 80%. This provides the best performance on MovingFashion, comparing exhaustively against the related state-of-the-art approaches and alternative baselines."}

For road segmentation, one of the principal causes of domain shift is variation in the geometric camera parameters, which results in misregistration of scene structure between images. To address this issue, we decompose the shift into two components: Between-camera shift and within-camera shift. To handle between-camera shift, we assume that average camera parameters are known or can be estimated and use this knowledge to rectify both source and target domain images to a standard virtual camera model. To handle within-camera shift, we use estimates of road vanishing points to correct for shifts in camera pan and tilt. While this approach improves alignment, it produces gaps in the virtual image that complicates network training. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel projective image completion method that fills these gaps in a plausible way. Using five diverse and challenging road segmentation datasets, we demonstrate that our virtual camera method dramatically improves road segmentation performance when generalizing across cameras, and propose that this be integrated as a standard component of road segmentation systems to improve generalization"}

One such algorithm is Expected Gradient Length, which as the name suggests uses the approximate gradient induced per example in the sampling process. While Expected Gradient Length has been successfully used for classification and regression, the formulation for regression remains intuitively driven. Hence, our theoretical contribution involves deriving this formulation, thereby supporting experimental evidence [4, 5]. Subsequently, we show that expected gradient length in regression is equivalent to Bayesian uncertainty [22]. If certain assumptions are infeasible, our algorithmic contribution (EGL++) approximates the effect of ensembles with a single deterministic network. Instead of computing multiple possible inferences per input, we leverage previously annotated samples to quantify the probability of previous labels being the true label. Such an approach allows us to extend expected gradient length to a new task: human pose estimation. We perform experimental validation on two human pose datasets (MPII and LSP/LSPET), highlighting the interpretability and competitiveness of EGL++ with different active learning algorithms for human pose estimation."}

The two primary requirements of a self-driving vehicle are real-time operation and nearly 100% accuracy in constructing the 3D scene regardless of the weather conditions and the degree of ambient light. Sadly, most real-time systems as of today provide a level of accuracy that is inadequate and this endangers the life of the passengers; consequently, it is necessary to supplement such systems with expensive LiDAR-based sensors. We observe that for a given scene, different stereo matching algorithms can have vastly different accuracies, and among these algorithms, there is no clear winner. This makes the case for a hybrid stereo vision system where the best stereo vision algorithm for a stereo image pair is chosen by a predictor dynamically, in real-time. We implement such a system called PredStereo in ASIC that combines two diametrically different stereo vision algorithms, CNN-based and traditional, and chooses the best one at runtime. In addition, it associates a confidence with the chosen algorithm, such that the higher-level control system can be switched on in case of a low confidence value. We show that designing a predictor that is explainable and a system that respects soft real-time constraints is non-trivial. Hence, we propose a variety of hardware optimizations that enable our system to work in real-time. Overall, PredStereo improves the disparity estimation error over a state-of-the-art CNN-based stereo vision system by up to 18% (on average 6.25%) with a negligible area overhead (0.003 mm^2) while respecting real-time constraints."}

Current methods for extracting object identification from observed data require spatially resolved imagery which limits identification to objects in low earth orbits. Most artificial satellites, however, operate in geostationary orbits at distances which prohibit ground based observatories from resolving spatial information. This paper demonstrates an object identification solution leveraging modified residual convolutional neural networks to map distance-invariant spectroscopic data to object identity. We report classification accuracies exceeding 80% for a simulated 64-class satellite problem--even in the case of satellites undergoing constant, random re-orientation. An astronomical observing campaign driven by these results returned accuracies of  72% for a nine-class problem with an average of 100 examples per class, performing as expected from simulation. We demonstrate the application of variational Bayesian inference by dropout, stochastic weight averaging (SWA), and SWA-focused deep ensembling to measure classification uncertainties--critical components in space traffic management where routine decisions risk expensive space assets and carry geopolitical consequences."}

In the absence of the photo-realistic image (only sketch/mask available), previous methods only retrieve the original face but ignore the potential of aiding model controllability and diversity in the translation process. This paper proposes a sketch-to-image generation framework called S2FGAN, aiming to improve users' ability to interpret and flexibility of face attribute editing from a simple sketch. First, to restore a vivid face from a sketch, we propose semantic level perceptual loss to increase the translation quality. Second, we dedicate the theoretic analysis of attribute editing and build attribute mapping networks with latent semantic loss to modify latent space semantics of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The users can command the model to retouch the generated images by involving the semantic information in the generation process. In this way, our method can manipulate single or multiple face attributes by only specifying attributes to be changed. Extensive experimental results on the CelebAMask-HQ dataset empirically show our superior performance and effectiveness on this task. Our method successfully outperforms state-of-the-art sketch-to-image generation and attribute manipulation methods by exploiting greater control of attribute intensity."}

In this paper, we introduce Graph-based Dual-modal Representations (GraDual), including Vision-Integrated Text Embedding (VITE) and Context-Integrated Visual Embedding (CIVE), for image-text retrieval. The GraDual improves the coverage of each modality by exploiting textual context semantics for the image representation, and using visual features as a guidance for the text representation. To be specific, we design: 1) a dual-modal graph representation mechanism to solve the lack of coverage issue for each modality. 2) an intermediate graph embedding integration strategy to enhance the important pattern across other modality global features. 3) a dual-modal driven cross-modal matching network to generate a filtered representation of another modality.

Computer vision face detection tools can provide such measurements; however, state-of-the-art face detection models were trained with photographs, and 80% of images in children's books are illustrated; thus existing methods both misclassify and miss classifying many faces. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to analyze images using AI tools, resulting in data that can assess representation of race, gender, and age in both illustrations and photographs in children's books. We make four primary contributions to the fields of deep learning and social sciences: (1) We curate an original face detection data set (IllusFace 1.0) by manually labeling 5,403 illustrated faces with bounding boxes. (2) We train two AutoML-based face detection models for illustrations: (i) using IllusFace 1.0 (FDAI); (ii) using iCartoon, a publicly available data set (FDAI_iC), each optimized for illustrated images, detecting 2.5 times more faces in our testing data than the established face detector using Google Vision (FDGV). (3) We curate a data set of the race, gender, and age of 980 faces manually labeled by three different raters (CBFeatures 1.0).

Therefore, we train a model that projects the image representations into an em-bedding space. In embedding space, similar actions have a low euclidean distance while dissimilar actions have a higher distance. The one-shot action recognition problem becomes a nearest-neighbor search in a set of activity reference samples. We evaluate the performance of our pro-posed representation against a variety of other skeleton-based image representations. In addition, we present an ablation study that shows the influence of different embedding vector sizes, losses and augmentation. Our approach lifts the state-of-the-art by 3.3% for the one-shot action recognition protocol on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset under a comparable training setup. With additional augmentation, our result improved over 7.7%"}

This gain, however, is attained with a high increase in computation cost, such that the network may not fit even on a moderate GPU. This issue raises problems when the model needs to be deployed on resource-limited devices. For this, we propose two light models for stereo vision with reduced complexity and without sacrificing accuracy. Depending on the dimension of cost volume, we design a 2D and a 3D model with encoder-decoders built from 2D and 3D convolutions, respectively. To this end, we leverage 2D MobileNet blocks and extend them to 3D for stereo vision application. Besides, a new cost volume is proposed to boost the accuracy of the 2D model, making it performing close to 3D networks. Experiments show that the proposed 2D/3D networks effectively reduce the computational expense (27%/95% and 72%/38% fewer parameters/operations in 2D and 3D models, respectively) while upholding the accuracy.

Thus, it is important to develop a generalized detector for synthesized images of any GAN model or object category, including those unseen during the training phase. However, the conventional methods heavily depend on the training settings, which cause a dramatic decline in performance when tested with unknown domains. To resolve the issue and obtain a generalized detection ability, we propose Bilateral High-Pass Filters (BiHPF), which amplify the effect of the frequency-level artifacts that are generally found in the synthesized images of generative models. Also, to find the properties of the general frequency-level artifacts, we develop an additional method to adversarially extract the artifact compression map. Numerous experimental results validate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, even when tested with unseen domains."}

Current 2D based methods either directly replace convolutional layers with pure transformers or consider a transformer as an additional intermediate encoder between the encoder and decoder of U-Net. However, these approaches only consider the attention encoding within one single slice and do not utilize the axial-axis information naturally provided by a 3D volume. In the 3D setting, convolution on volumetric data and transformers both consume large GPU memory. One has to either downsample the image or use cropped local patches to reduce GPU memory usage, which limits its performance. In this paper, we propose Axial Fusion Transformer UNet (AFTer-UNet), which takes both advantages of convolutional layers' capability of extracting detailed features and transformers' strength on long sequence modeling. It considers both intra-slice and inter-slice long-range cues to guide the segmentation. Meanwhile, it has fewer parameters and takes less GPU memory to train than the previous transformer-based models. Extensive experiments on three multi-organ segmentation datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods."}

Especially, the prediction based approach is one of the most studied methods to detect anomalies by predicting frames that include abnormal events in the test set after learning with the normal frames of the training set. However, a lot of prediction networks are computationally expensive owing to the use of pre-trained optical flow networks, or fail to detect abnormal situations because of their strong generative ability to predict even the anomalies. To address these shortcomings, we propose spatial rotation transformation (SRT) and temporal mixing transformation (TMT) to generate irregular patch cuboids within normal frame cuboids in order to enhance the learning of normal features. Additionally, the proposed patch transformation is used only during the training phase, allowing our model to detect abnormal frames at fast speed during inference. Our model is evaluated on three anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving competitive accuracy and surpassing all the previous works in terms of speed."}

The task aims to discriminatively understand an instance of a particular 3D object described by natural language utterances among other instances of 3D objects of the same class appearing in a visual scene. We introduce the 3DRefTransformer net, a transformer-based neural network that identifies 3D objects described by linguistic utterances in real-world scenes. The network's input is 3D object segmented point cloud images representing a real-world scene and a language utterance that refers to one of the scene objects. The goal is to identify the referred object. Compared to the state-of-the-art models that are mostly based on graph convolutions and LSTMs, our 3DRefTransformer net offers two key advantages. First, it is an end-to-end transformer model that operates both on language and 3D visual objects. Second, it has a natural ability to ground textual terms in the utterance to the learning representation of 3D objects in the scene. We further incorporate object pairwise spatial relation loss and contrastive learning during model training. We show in our experiments that our model improves the performance upon the current SOTA significantly on Referit3D Nr3D and Sr3D datasets. Code and Models will be made publicly available."}

However, generating counterfactual examples for images is non-trivial due to the underlying causal structure on the various features of an image. To be meaningful, generated perturbations need to satisfy constraints implied by the causal model. We present a method for generating counterfactuals by incorporating a structural causal model (SCM) in an improved variant of Adversarially Learned Inference (ALI), that generates counterfactuals in accordance with the causal relationships between attributes of an image. Based on the generated counterfactuals, we show how to explain a pre-trained machine learning classifier, evaluate its bias, and mitigate the bias using a counterfactual regularizer. On the Morpho-MNIST dataset, our method generates counterfactuals comparable in quality to prior work on SCM-based counterfactuals. Our method also works on the more complex CelebA faces dataset. Generated counterfactuals are indistinguishable from reconstructed images in a human evaluation experiment and we use them to evaluate a standard classifier trained on CelebA data. We show that the classifier is biased w.r.t. skin and hair color, and how counterfactual regularization can remove those biases."}

However, one of the deleterious side-effects of these advances is the emergence of nefarious uses in manipulating information in visual data, such as through the use of deep fakes. We propose a novel architecture for preserving the provenance of semantic information in images to make them less susceptible to deep fake attacks. Our architecture includes semantic signing and verification steps. We apply this architecture to verifying two types of semantic information: individual identities (faces) and whether the photo was taken indoors or outdoors. Verification in both cases carefully accounts for a collection of common image transformation, such as translation, scaling, cropping, and small rotations, and rejects adversarial transformations, such as adversarially perturbed or, in the case of face verification, swapped faces. Experiments demonstrate that in the case of provenance of faces in an image, our approach is robust to black-box adversarial transformations (which are rejected) as well as benign transformations (which are accepted), with few false negatives and false positives. Background verification, on the other hand, is susceptible to black-box adversarial examples, but becomes significantly more robust after adversarial training."}

Recent works in this domain have mainly focused on direct manipulation of the raw RGB pixels, which only allows to perform edits involving relatively small shape changes (e.g., sleeves). The goal of our Virtual Personal Tailoring Network (VPTNet) is to extend the editing capabilities to much larger shape changes of fashion items, such as cloth length. To achieve this goal, we decouple the fashion attribute editing task into two conditional stages: shape-then-appearance editing. To this aim, we propose a shape editing network that employs a semantic parsing of the fashion image as an interface for manipulation. Compared to operating on the raw RGB image, our parsing map editing enables performing more complex shape editing operations. Second, we introduce an appearance completion network that takes the previous stage results and completes the shape difference regions to produce the final RGB image. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on the DeepFashion-Synthesis dataset confirm that VPTNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both small and large shape attribute editing."}

Learning-based approaches have lately emerged to improve the quality of colorization. To handle the lack of paired data in line art and color images, sketch extraction has been widely adopted. This study primarily focuses on the resizing process applied within the sketch extraction procedure, which is essential for normalizing input sketches of various sizes to the target size of the colorization model. We first analyze the inherent risk in a conventional resizing strategy, i.e., early-resizing, which places the resizing step before the line detection process to ensure the practicality. Although the strategy is extensively used, it involves an often overlooked risk of significantly degrading the generalization of the colorization model. Thus, we propose a late-resizing strategy in which resizing is applied after the line detection step. The proposed late-resizing strategy has three advantages: prevention of a quality degradation in the color image, augmentation for downsizing artifacts, and alleviation of look-ahead bias. In conclusion, we present both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on representative learning-based line-art colorization methods, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in the generalization of the colorization model."}

Randomness is indeed a powerful concept. However, it comes with a price--some walks might wander around non-characteristic regions of the mesh, which might be harmful to shape analysis, especially when only a few walks are utilized. We propose a novel walk-attention mechanism that leverages the fact that multiple walks are used for a single mesh representation. The key idea is that the walks may provide each other with information regarding the meaningful (attentive) features of the mesh. We utilize this mutual information to extract a single descriptor of the mesh. This differs from common attention mechanisms that use attention to improve the representation of each individual descriptor. Our approach achieves SoTA results for two basic 3D shape analysis tasks: classification and retrieval. Even a handful of walks along a mesh suffice for learning. Furthermore, our approach provides insight into mesh importance detection."}

The basic idea is to train sub-network to match the prediction of the full network, so-called \"Self-Guidance\". Under the \"teacher-student\" framework, we construct both teacher and student within the same target network. Student network is the sub-networks that randomly skip some portions of the full network. The teacher network is the full network, can be considered as the ensemble of all possible student networks. The training process is performed in a closed-loop: (1) Forward prediction contains two passes that generate student and teacher predictions. (2) Backward distillation allows knowledge transfer from the teacher back to students. Comprehensive evaluations show that our approach improves the generalization ability of deep neural networks to a significant margin. The results prove our superior performance in both image classification on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and facial expression recognition on FER-2013 and RAF."}

To prevent such harm, we propose an anti-spoofing method using the pairs of RGB images and depth maps provided by the mobile camera with a time-of-fight sensor. When images are recaptured on display screens, various patterns differing by the screens as known as the moire patterns can be also captured in spoof images. These patterns lead the anti-spoofing model to be overfitted and unable to detect spoof images recaptured on unseen media. To avoid the issue, we build a novel representation model composed of two embedding models, which can be trained without considering the recaptured images. Also, we newly introduce mToF dataset, the largest and most diverse object anti-spoofing dataset, and the first to utilize the time-of-flight (ToF) data.

The number of monocular images in each multi-view input can variate during training and inference; actually, this number might be unique for each multi-view input.

Existing approaches exploit convolutional layers that extract image-level features learning the colourisation on the entire image, but miss entities-level ones due to pooling strategies. We believe that entity-level features are of paramount importance to deal with the intrinsic multimodality of the problem (i.e., the same object can have different colours, and the same colour can have different properties). Models based on capsule layers aim to identify entity-level features in the image from different points of view, but they do not keep track of global features. Our network architecture integrates entity-level features into the image-level features to generate a plausible image colourisation. We observed that results obtained with direct integration of such two representations are largely dominated by the image-level features, thus resulting in unsaturated colours for the entities. To limit such an issue, we propose a gradual growth of the reconstruction phase of the model while training. By advantaging of prior knowledge from each growing step, we obtain a stable collaboration between image-level and entity-level features that ultimately generates stable and vibrant colourisations. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets, and a user study, demonstrate that our approach has competitive performance with respect to the state-of-the-art and provides more consistent colourisation.

SaBN is motivated by addressing the inherent feature distribution heterogeneity that one can be identified in many tasks, which can arise from data heterogeneity (multiple input domains) or model heterogeneity (dynamic architectures, model conditioning, etc.). Our SaBN factorizes the BN affine layer into one shared sandwich affine layer, cascaded by several parallel independent affine layers. Concrete analysis reveals that, during optimization, SaBN promotes balanced gradient norms while still preserving diverse gradient directions -- a property that many application tasks seem to favor. We demonstrate the prevailing effectiveness of SaBN as a drop-in replacement in four tasks: conditional image generation, neural architecture search (NAS), adversarial training, and arbitrary style transfer. Leveraging SaBN immediately achieves better Inception Score and FID on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet conditional image generation with three state-of-the-art GANs; boosts the performance of a state-of-the-art weight-sharing NAS algorithm significantly on NAS-Bench-201; substantially improves the robust and standard accuracies for adversarial defense; and produces superior arbitrary stylized results.

This is a challenging problem due to vast localization areas, the variable appearance of outdoor environments and the scarcity of available data. In order to make the research of new approaches possible, we first create two databases containing \"synthetic\" images of various modalities. These image modalities are rendered from a 3D terrain model and include semantic segmentations, silhouette maps and depth maps. By combining the rendered database views with existing datasets of photographs (used as \"queries\" to be localized), we create a unique benchmark for visual geo-localization in natural environments, which contains correspondences between query photographs and rendered database imagery. The distinct ability to match photographs to synthetically rendered databases defines our task as \"cross-modal\". On top of this benchmark, we provide thorough ablation studies analysing the localization potential of the database image modalities. We reveal the depth information as the best choice for outdoor localization. Finally, based on our observations, we carefully develop a fully-automatic method for large-scale cross-modal localization using image retrieval. We demonstrate its localization performance outdoors in the entire state of Switzerland. Our method reveals a large gap between operating within a single image domain (e.g. photographs) and working across domains (e.g. photographs matched to rendered images), as gained knowledge is not transferable between the two. Moreover, we show that modern localization methods fail when applied to such a cross-modal task and that our method achieves significantly better results than state-of-the-art approaches.

Our model generates novel poses based on keypoint locations, which can be modified in real time while providing interactive feedback, allowing for intuitive reposing and animation. Since we only have very limited training samples, one of the key challenges lies in how to address (dis)occlusions, e.g. when a hand moves behind or in front of a body. To address this, we introduce a novel layering approach which explicitly splits the input keypoints into different layers which are processed independently. These layers represent different parts of the character and provide a strong implicit bias that helps to obtain realistic results even with strong (dis)occlusions. To combine the features of individual layers we use an adaptive scaling approach conditioned on all keypoints. Finally, we introduce a mask connectivity constraint to reduce distortion artifacts that occur with extreme out-of-distribution poses at test time. We show that our approach outperforms recent baselines and creates realistic animations for diverse characters. We also show that our model can handle discrete state changes, for example a profile facing left or right, that the different layers do indeed learn features specific for the respective keypoints in those layers, and that our model scales to larger datasets when more data is available.

This paper presents a new deep periocular recognition framework called attribute-based deep periocular recognition (ADPR), which predicts soft biometrics and incorporates the prediction into a periocular recognition algorithm to determine identity from periocular images with high accuracy. We propose an end-to-end framework, which uses several shared convolutional neural network (CNN) layers (a common network) whose output feeds two separate dedicated branches (modality dedicated layers); the first branch classifies periocular images while the second branch predicts soft biometrics. Next, the features from these two branches are fused together for a final periocular recognition. The proposed method is different from existing methods as it not only uses a shared CNN feature space to train these two tasks jointly, but it also fuses predicted soft biometric features with the periocular features in the training step to improve the overall periocular recognition performance. Our proposed model is extensively evaluated using four different publicly available datasets. Experimental results indicate that our soft biometric based periocular recognition approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for periocular recognition in wild environments."}

In both cases, the phase content is discarded. To address the fundamental problem of real-valued deep networks, i.e. their inability to process complex-valued data, we propose a complex-valued generative adversarial network (Co-VeGAN) framework, which is the first-of-its-kind generative model exploring the use of complex-valued weights and operations. Further, since real-valued activation functions do not generalize well to the complex-valued space, we propose a novel complex-valued activation function that is sensitive to the input phase and has a learnable profile.

Most successful defense strategies adopt adversarial training or random input transformations that typically require retraining or fine-tuning the model to achieve reasonable performance. In this work, our investigations of intermediate representations of a pre-trained DNN lead to an interesting discovery pointing to intrinsic robustness to adversarial attacks. We find that we can learn a generative classifier by statistically characterizing the neural response of an intermediate layer to clean training samples. The predictions of multiple such intermediate-layer based classifiers, when aggregated, show unexpected robustness to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we devise an ensemble of these generative classifiers that rank-aggregates their predictions via a Borda count-based consensus. Our proposed approach uses a subset of the clean training data and a pre-trained model, and yet is agnostic to network architectures or the adversarial attack generation method.

Our model is simple to implement and more efficient with respect to the state of the art -- faster in inference and smaller in terms of memory occupancy -- with comparable accuracy. Our method also provides a measure of the heteroscedastic uncertainties associated with the three angles, through an appropriately designed loss function; we show there is a correlation between error and uncertainty values, thus this extra source of information may be used in subsequent computational steps.

More recently, MLP-mixer abandons both the convolution and the self-attention operation, proposing an architecture containing only MLP layers. To achieve cross-patch communications, it devises an additional token-mixing MLP besides the channel-mixing MLP. It achieves promising results when training on an extremely large-scale dataset such as JFT-300M. But it cannot achieve as outstanding performance as its CNN and ViT counterparts when training on medium-scale datasets such as ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K. The performance drop of MLP-mixer motivates us to rethink the token-mixing MLP. We discover that token-mixing operation in MLP-mixer is a variant of depthwise convolution with a global reception field and spatial-specific configuration. It is the global reception field and the spatial-specific property that make token-mixing MLP prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel pure MLP architecture, spatial-shift MLP (S^2-MLP). Different from MLP-mixer, our S^2-MLP only contains channel-mixing MLP. We devise a spatial-shift operation for achieving the communication between patches. It has a local reception field and is spatial-agnostic. Meanwhile, it is parameter-free and efficient for computation. The proposed S^2-MLP attains higher recognition accuracy than MLP-mixer when training on ImageNet-1K dataset. Meanwhile, S^2-MLP accomplishes as excellent performance as ViT on ImageNet-1K dataset with considerably simpler architecture and fewer FLOPs and parameters."}

For models to generalize to unseen classes in unseen domains, it is crucial to learn feature representation that preserves class-level (domain-invariant) as well as domain-specific information. Motivated from the success of generative zero-shot approaches, we propose a feature generative framework integrated with a COntext COnditional Adaptive (COCOA) Batch-Normalization layer to seamlessly integrate class-level semantic and domain-specific information. The generated visual features better capture the underlying data distribution enabling us to generalize to unseen classes and domains at test-time. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on established large-scale benchmarks -- DomainNet, DomainNet-LS (Limited Sources) -- as well as a new CUB-Corruptions benchmark, and demonstrate promising performance over baselines and state-of-the-art methods. We show detailed ablations and analysis to verify that our proposed approach indeed allows us to generate better quality visual features relevant for zero-shot domain generalization."}

Recently, there has been several efforts to make DNNs more efficient via quantization. However, SR demands pixel-level accuracy in the system, it is more difficult to perform quantization without significantly sacrificing SR performance. To this end, we introduce a new ultra-low precision yet effective quantization approach specifically designed for SR. In particular, we observe that in recent SR networks, each channel has different distribution characteristics. Thus we propose a channel-wise distribution-aware quantization scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed quantization, dubbed Distribution-Aware Quantization (DAQ), manages to greatly reduce the computational and resource costs without the significant sacrifice in SR performance, compared to other quantization methods."}

Our method enables effortless creation of an arbitrarily large dataset of carefully tampered images in which controlled detection cues are present. Starting with raw images, we alter aspects of the image formation pipeline inside a mask, while leaving the rest of the image intact. This does not change the image's interpretation; we thus call such alterations \"non-semantic\", as they yield no semantic inconsistencies. This method avoids the painful and often biased creation of convincing semantics. All aspects of image formation (noise, CFA, compression pattern and quality, etc.) can vary independently in both the authentic and tampered parts of the image. Alteration of a specific cue enables precise evaluation of the many forgery detectors that rely on this cue, and of the sensitivity of more generic forensic tools to each specific trace of forgery, and can be used to guide the combination of different methods. Based on this methodology, we create a database and conduct an evaluation of the main state-of-the-art image forensics tools, where we characterize the performance of each method with respect to each detection cue.

To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply it to three different tasks: human affordance prediction, Location2Object and 6D object pose hallucination.

It has been studied extensively in robotics as a problem of motion planning, actuator control and obstacle avoidance. However, the task of developing a generalized framework for assembly robust to structural variants remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we tackle this problem using a recurrent graph learning framework considering inter-part relations and the progressive update of the part pose. Our network can learn more plausible predictions of shape structure by accounting for priorly assembled parts. Compared to the current state-of-the-art, our network yields up to 10% improvement in part accuracy and up to 15% improvement in connectivity accuracy on the PartNet dataset. Moreover, our resulting latent space facilitates exciting applications such as shape recovery from the point-cloud components.

To improve the robustness for navigation in dark environments, SIGNAV leverages a multi-sensor navigation architecture to fuse vision with additional sensing modalities, including an inertial measurement unit (IMU), LiDAR, and wheel odometry. A new 2.5D semantic segmentation method is also developed to combine both images and LiDAR depth maps to generate semantic labels of 3D mapped points in real time.

We take inspiration from Video Textures, which showed that plausible new videos could be generated from a single one by stitching its frames together in a novel yet consistent order. This classic work, however, was constrained by its use of hand-designed distance metrics, limiting its use to simple, repetitive videos. We draw on recent techniques from self-supervised learning to learn this distance metric, allowing us to compare frames in a manner that scales to more challenging dynamics, and to condition on other data, such as audio. We learn representations for video frames and frame-to-frame transition probabilities by fitting a video-specific model trained using contrastive learning. To synthesize a texture, we randomly sample frames with high transition probabilities to generate diverse temporally smooth videos with novel sequences and transitions. The model naturally extends to an audio-conditioned setting without requiring any fine-tuning. Our model outperforms baselines on human perceptual scores, can handle a diverse range of input videos, and can combine semantic and audio-visual cues in order to synthesize videos that synchronize well with an audio signal."}

Modern computer vision algorithms are of great interest in aiding such missions. However, they are dependent on large amounts of real-case training data from UAVs, which is only available for traffic scenarios on land. Moreover, current object detection and tracking data sets only provide limited environmental information or none at all, neglecting a valuable source of information. Therefore, this paper introduces a large-scaled visual object detection and tracking benchmark (SeaDronesSee) aiming to bridge the gap from land-based vision systems to sea-based ones. We collect and annotate over 54,000 frames with 400,000 instances captured from various altitudes and viewing angles ranging from 5 to 260 meters and 0 to 90 degrees while providing the respective meta information for altitude, viewing angle and other meta data.

Existing works in self-supervised landmark detection are based on learning dense (pixel-level) feature representations from an image, which are further used to learn landmarks in a semi-supervised manner. While there have been advances in self-supervised learning of image features for instance-level tasks like classification, these methods do not ensure dense equivariant representations. The property of equivariance is of interest for dense prediction tasks like landmark estimation. In this work, we introduce an approach to enhance the learning of dense equivariant representations in a self-supervised fashion. We follow a two-stage training approach: first, we train a network using the BYOL objective which operates at an instance level. The correspondences obtained through this network are further used to train a dense and compact representation of the image using a lightweight network. We show that having such a prior in the feature extractor helps in landmark detection, even under drastically limited number of annotations while also improving generalization across scale variations."}

In this paper, we identify a \"warm-up obstacle\": the inability of standard warm-up stages to train high quality feature extractors and avert memorization of noisy labels. We propose \"Contrast to Divide\" (C2D), a simple framework that solves this problem by pre-training the feature extractor in a self-supervised fashion. Using self-supervised pre-training boosts the performance of existing LNL approaches by drastically reducing the warm-up stage's susceptibility to noise level, shortening its duration, and improving extracted feature quality. C2D works out of the box with existing methods and demonstrates markedly improved performance, especially in the high noise regime, where we get a boost of more than 27% for CIFAR-100 with 90% noise over the previous state of the art. In real-life noise settings, C2D trained on mini-WebVision outperforms previous works both in WebVision and ImageNet validation sets by 3% top-1 accuracy. We perform an in-depth analysis of the framework, including investigating the performance of different pre-training approaches and estimating the effective upper bound of the LNL performance with semi-supervised learning.

To this end, a novel network (Co-Net) is presented to dynamically use fine saliency segmentation to guide finer segmentation on boundaries. The whole architecture contains double mutually boosted decoders sharing one common encoder. Specifically, a new structure named Global-guided Interaction Module (GIM) is designed to effectively control the information flow and reduce redundancy in the cross-level feature fusion process. At the same time, the global features are used in it to make the features of each layer gain access to richer context, and a fine segmentation map is obtained initially; Discontinuous Boundary Supervision (DBS) strategy is applied to pay more attention to discontinuity positions and modifying segmentation errors on boundaries. At last, Selective Kernel (SK) is used for dynamical aggregation of the region and contour features to obtain a finer segmentation. Our proposed approach is evaluated on an independent GEDD dataset labeled by pathologists and also on open polyp datasets to test the generalization. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of different modules. On all datasets, our proposal achieves high segmentation accuracy and surpasses previous methods."}

However, human can learn new classes quickly even given few samples since human can tell what discriminative features should be focused on about each category based on both the visual and semantic prior knowledge. To better utilize those prior knowledge, we propose the SEmantic Guided Attention (SEGA) mechanism where the semantic knowledge is used to guide the visual perception in a top-down manner about what visual features should be paid attention to when distinguishing a category from the others. As a result, the embedding of the novel class even with few samples can be more discriminative. Concretely, a feature extractor is trained to embed few images of each novel class into a visual prototype with the help of transferring visual prior knowledge from base classes. Then we learn a network that maps semantic knowledge to category-specific attention vectors which will be used to perform feature selection to enhance the visual prototypes. Extensive experiments on miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and CUB indicate that our semantic guided attention realizes anticipated function and outperforms state-of-the-art results."}

Although recent methods have achieved early success in improving feature extraction technique for AVSD, the technique of feature fusion still needs further investigation. In this paper, inspired by the success of self-attention mechanism and the importance of understanding questions for VQA answering, we propose a question-guided self-attentive multi-modal fusion network (QUALIFIER) (QUALIFIER) to improve the AVSD practice in the stage of feature fusion and answer generation. Specifically, after extracting features and learning a comprehensive feature for each modality, we first use the designed self-attentive multi-modal fusion (SMF) module to aggregate each feature with the correlated information learned from others. Later, by prioritizing the question feature, we concatenate it with each fused feature to guide the generation of a natural language response to the question. As for experimental results, QUALIFIER shows better performance than other baseline methods in the large-scale AVSD dataset named DSTC7. Additionally, the human evaluation and ablation study results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our network architecture."}

However, we find that these methods fail to remove the rain streaks when applied for image deraining tasks. The method's poor performance is due to the explicit assumptions: (i) the distribution of noise or haze is uniform and (ii) the value of a noisy or hazy pixel is independent of its neighbors. The rainy pixels are non-uniformly distributed, and it is not necessarily dependant on its neighboring pixels. Hence, we conclude that the self-supervised method needs to have some prior knowledge about rain distribution to perform the deraining task. To provide this knowledge, we hypothesize a network trained with minimal supervision to estimate the likelihood of rainy pixels. This leads us to our proposed method called FLUID: Few Shot Self-Supervised Image Deraining. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons with existing image deraining and few-shot image-to-image translation methods on Rain 100L and DDN-SIRR datasets containing real and synthetic rainy images. In addition, we use the Rainy Cityscapes dataset to show that our method trained in a few-shot setting can improve semantic segmentation and object detection in rainy conditions. Our approach obtains a mIoU gain of 51.20 over the current best-performing deraining method."}

Incorporating user feedback, via multi-modal inputs, to navigate visual search can help tailor retrieved results to specific user queries. We focus on the task of text-conditioned image retrieval that utilizes support text feedback alongside a reference image to retrieve images that concurrently satisfy constraints imposed by both inputs. The task is challenging since it requires learning composite image-text features by incorporating multiple cross-granular semantic edits from text feedback and then applying the same to visual features. To address this, we propose a novel framework SAC which resolves the above in two major steps: \"where to see\" (Semantic Feature Attention) and \"how to change\" (Semantic Feature Modification). We systematically show how our architecture streamlines the generation of text-aware image features by removing the need for various modules required by other state-of-art techniques. We present extensive quantitative, qualitative analysis, and ablation studies, to show that our architecture SAC outperforms existing techniques by achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3 benchmark datasets: FashionIQ, Shoes, and Birds-to-Words while supporting natural language feedback of varying lengths."}

This is particularly true for camera-LiDAR based multimodal fusion, which may require three separate deep-learning networks and/or processing pipelines that are designated for the visual data, LiDAR data, and for some form of a fusion framework. In this paper, we propose Fast Camera-LiDAR Object Candidates (Fast-CLOCs) fusion network that can run high-accuracy fusion-based 3D object detection in near real-time. Fast-CLOCs operates on the output candidates before Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) of any 3D detector, and adds a lightweight 3D detector-cued 2D image detector (3D-Q-2D) to extract visual features from the image domain to improve 3D detections significantly. The 3D detection candidates are shared with the proposed 3D-Q-2D image detector as proposals to reduce the network complexity drastically. The superior experimental results of our Fast-CLOCs on the challenging KITTI and nuScenes datasets illustrate that our Fast-CLOCs outperforms state-of-the-art fusion-based 3D object detection approaches."}

In this paper, we introduce a real-time method that is a significant step towards enabling touch typing on arbitrary flat surfaces (e.g., tables). The method employs only a simple video camera, placed in front of the user on the flat surface --- at an angle practical for mobile usage. To achieve this, we adopt a classification framework, based on the observation that, in touch typing, similar hand configurations imply the same typed character across users. Importantly, this approach allows the convenience of un-calibrated typing, where the hand positions, with respect to the camera and each other, are not dictated. To improve accuracy, we propose a Language Processing scheme, which corrects the typed text and is specifically designed for real-time performance and integration with the vision-based signal. To enable feasible data collection and training, we propose a self-refinement approach that allows training on unlabeled flat-surface-typing footage; A network trained on (labeled) keyboard footage labels flat-surface videos using dynamic time warping, and is trained on them, in an Expectation Maximization (EM) manner. Using these techniques, we introduce the TypingHands26 Dataset, comprising videos of 26 different users typing on a keyboard, and 10 users typing on a flat surface, labeled at the frame level. We validate our approach and present a single camera-based system with character-level accuracy of 93.5% on average for known users, and 85.7% for unknown ones, outperforming pose-estimation-based methods by a large margin, despite performing at natural typing speeds of up to 80 Words Per Minute. Our method is the first to rely on a simple camera alone, and runs in interactive speeds, while still maintaining accuracy comparable to systems employing non-commodity equipment."}

Previous works such as RecipeQA have proposed datasets and cloze-style tasks for evaluation. However, we identify three critical biases stemming from the question-answer generation process and memorization capabilities of large deep models. These biases makes it easier for a model to overfit by relying on spurious correlations or naive data patterns. We propose a systematic framework to address these biases through three Control-Knobs that enable us to generate a test bed of datasets of progressive difficulty levels. We believe that our benchmark (referred to as Meta- RecipeQA) will provide, for the first time, a fine grained estimate of a model's generalization capabilities. We also propose a generalM3C model that is used to realize several prior SOTA models and motivate a novel hierarchical transformer based reasoning network (HTRN). We perform a detailed evaluation of these models with different language and visual features on our benchmark. We observe a consistent improvement with HTRN over SOTA (  18% in Visual Cloze task and   13% in average over all the tasks). We also observe a drop in performance across all the models when testing on RecipeQA and proposed Meta-RecipeQA (e.g. 83.6% versus 67.1% for HTRN), which shows that the proposed dataset is relatively less biased. We conclude by highlighting the impact of the control knobs with some quantitative results."}

Thus in this work we propose an unsupervised method, namely SSCAP, that operates on a corpus of unlabeled videos and predicts a likely set of temporal segments across the videos. SSCAP leverages Self-Supervised learning to extract distinguishable features and then applies a novel Co-occurrence Action Parsing algorithm to not only capture the correlation among sub-actions underlying the structure of activities, but also estimate the temporal path of the sub-actions in an accurate and general way. We evaluate on both classic datasets (Breakfast, 50Salads) and the emerging fine-grained action dataset (FineGym) with more complex activity structures and similar sub-actions. Results show that SSCAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets and can even outperform some weakly-supervised approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability."}

As annotated objects exist in the target domain, instance level alignment can be utilized to improve the performance. Traditional methods conduct the instance level alignment by semantically aligning the distributions of paired object features with domain adversarial training. Although it is demonstrated that point-wise surrogates of distribution alignment provide a more effective solution in few-shot classification tasks across domains, this point-wise alignment approach has not yet been extended to object detection. In this work, we propose a method that extends the point-wise alignment from classification to object detection. Moreover, in the few-shot loose annotation setting, the background ROIs of target domain suffer from severe label noise problem, which may make the point-wise alignment fail. To this end, we exploit moving average centroids to mitigate the label noise problem of background ROIs. Meanwhile, we exploit point-wise alignment over instances and centroids to tackle the problem of scarcity of labeled target instances. Hence this method is not only robust against label noises of background ROIs but also robust against the scarcity of labeled target objects. Experimental results show that the proposed instance level alignment method brings significant improvement compared with the baseline and is superior to state-of-the-art methods."}

By having to implicitly account for geometric and photometric variations in facial shape and appearance, such approaches result in unrealistic completions, especially under large variations in pose, shape, illumination and mask sizes. To alleviate these limitations, we introduce 3DFaceFill, an analysis-by-synthesis approach for face completion that explicitly considers the image formation process. It comprises three components, (1) an encoder that disentangles the face into its constituent 3D mesh, 3D pose, illumination and albedo factors, (2) an autoencoder that inpaints the UV representation of facial albedo, and (3) a renderer that resynthesizes the completed face. By operating on the UV representation, 3DFaceFill affords the power of correspondence and allows us to naturally enforce geometrical priors (e.g. facial symmetry) more effectively. Quantitatively, 3DFaceFill improves the state-of-the-art by up to 4dB higher PSNR and 25% better LPIPS for large masks. And, qualitatively, it leads to demonstrably more photorealistic face completions over a range of masks and occlusions while preserving consistency in global and component-wise shape, pose, illumination and eye-gaze."}

While imputation-based techniques are still one of the most popular solutions, they frequently introduce unreliable information to the data and do not take into account the uncertainty of estimation, which may be destructive for a machine learning model. In this paper, we present MisConv, a general mechanism, for adapting various CNN architectures to process incomplete images. By modeling the distribution of missing values by the Mixture of Factor Analyzers, we cover the spectrum of possible replacements and find an analytical formula for the expected value of convolution operator applied to the incomplete image. The whole framework is realized by matrix operations, which makes MisConv extremely efficient in practice.

In this work we propose a simple sample selection criterion that moves beyond the conventional reliance on model uncertainty as proxy to leverage new labels. By first accepting the model prediction and then judging its effect on the generalization error, we can better identify wrongly predicted samples. We also present a very efficient approximation to our criterion, providing a similarity-based interpretation. In addition to evaluating our method on the standard benchmarks of active learning, we consider the challenging yet realistic imbalanced data scenario. We show state-of-the-art results, especially on the imbalanced setting, and achieve better rates at identifying wrongly predicted samples than existing active learning methods. Our method is simple, model agnostic and relies on the current model status without the need for re-training from scratch."}

First, we introduce DeepPatent, a new large-scale dataset for recognition and retrieval of design patent drawings. The dataset provides more than 350,000 design patent drawings for the purpose of image retrieval. Unlike existing datasets, DeepPatent provides fine-grained image retrieval associations within the collection of drawings and does not rely on cross-domain associations for supervision. We develop a baseline deep learning models, named PatentNet, based on best practices for training retrieval models for static images. We demonstrate the superior performance of PatentNet when trained on our fine-grained associations of DeepPatent against other deep learning approaches and classic computer vision descriptors, such as histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), on DeepPatent. With the introduction of this new dataset, and benchmark algorithms, we demonstrate that the analysis and retrieval of line drawings remains an open challenge in computer vision; and that patent drawing retrieval provides a concrete testbench to spur research."}

We define it as a metric learning problem, where similar products are projected close to each other and dissimilar ones are projected further apart. To this end, we propose a scalable end-to-end multimodal framework for product representation learning in a weakly supervised setting using raw data from the catalog. This includes product images as well as textual attributes like product title and category information. The model uses the image as the primary source of information, while the title helps the model focus on relevant regions in the image by ignoring the background clutter. To validate our approach, we created multimodal datasets covering three broad product categories, where we achieve up to 10% improvement in precision compared to state-of-the-art multimodal benchmark. Along with this, we also incorporate several effective heuristics for training data generation, which further complements the overall training. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating the product title makes the model scale effectively across multiple product categories."}

Recent work aims to overcome this limitation by leveraging the power of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), a joint text-image model. While promising, these methods require several hours of preprocessing or training to achieve the desired manipulations. In this paper, we present StyleMC, a fast and efficient method for text-driven image generation and manipulation. StyleMC uses a CLIP-based loss and an identity loss to manipulate images via a single text prompt without significantly affecting other attributes. Unlike prior work, StyleMC requires only a few seconds of training per text prompt to find stable global directions, does not require prompt engineering and can be used with any pre-trained StyleGAN2 model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and compare it to state-of-the-art methods."}

A limitation of existing models is that they have many parameters, which in turn prevents their use for larger image resolutions and leads to slower run-times. We introduce two mechanisms that enable our design of a more compact model that we call PhotoWCT2, which preserves state-of-art stylization strength and photorealism. First, we introduce blockwise training to perform coarse-to-fine feature transformations that enable state-of-art stylization strength in a single autoencoder in place of the inefficient cascade of four autoencoders used in PhotoWCT. Second, we introduce skip connections of high-frequency residuals in order to preserve image quality when applying the sequential coarse-to-fine feature transformations. Our PhotoWCT2 model requires fewer parameters (e.g., 30.3% fewer) while supporting higher resolution images (e.g., 4K) and achieving faster stylization than existing models."}

Current place recognition approaches lack the ability to go beyond objects that are available in the image and hence miss out on understanding the scene completely. In this paper, we take a step towards holistic scene understanding. We address the problem of image geo-localization by retrieving corresponding aerial views from a large database of geotagged aerial imagery. One of the main challenges in tackling this problem is the limited Field of View (FoV) nature of query images which needs to be matched to aerial views which contain 360degFoV details. State-of-the-art method DSM-Net [17] tackles this challenge by matching aerial images locally within fixed FoV sectors. We show that local matching limits complete scene understanding and is inadequate when partial buildings are visible in query images or when local sectors of aerial images are covered by dense trees. Our approach considers both local and global properties of aerial images and hence is robust to such conditions. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed approach improves top-1% image recall rate on the CVACT [9] data-set from 57.08% to 77.19% and from 61.20% to 75.21% on the CVUSA [25] data-set for 70degFoV. We also achieve state-of-the art results for 90degFoV on both CVACT [9] and CVUSA [25] data-sets demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method."}

Due to potentially large drifts in the initial pose guess as well as maps containing unfiltered dynamic and temporal static objects (e.g. parking cars), traditional methods like ICP tend to fail and show high computation times. We propose a novel and fast relocalization method for accurate pose estimation inside a pre-built map based on 3D point clouds. The method is robust against inaccurate initialization caused by low performance GPS systems and tolerates the presence of unfiltered objects by specifically learning to extract significant features from current scans and adjacent map sections. More specifically, we introduce a novel distance-based matching loss enabling us to simultaneously extract important information from raw point clouds and aggregating inner- and inter-cloud context by utilizing self- and cross-attention inside a Graph Neural Network. We evaluate StickyLocalization's (SL) performance through an extensive series of experiments using two benchmark datasets in terms of Relocalization on NuScenes and Loop Closing using KITTI's Odometry dataset. We found that SL outperforms state-of-the art point cloud registration and relocalization methods in terms of transformation errors and runtime."}

Despite achieving state-of-the-art results, one of the major drawbacks of those approaches is the lack of a forward model that informs the agent about the potential consequences of its actions, i.e., being model-free. In this work, we augment the model-free RL with such a forward model that can predict a representation of a future state, from the beginning of a navigation episode, if the episode were to be successful. Furthermore, in order for efficient training, we develop an algorithm to integrate a replay buffer into the model-free RL that alternates between training the policy and the forward model. We call our agent ForeSI; ForeSI is trained to imagine a future latent state that leads to success. By explicitly imagining such a state, during the navigation, our agent is able to take better actions leading to two main advantages: first, in the absence of an object detector, ForeSI presents a more robust policy, i.e., it leads to about 5% absolute improvement on the Success Rate (SR); second, when combined with an off-the-shelf object detector to help better distinguish the target object, our method leads to about 3% absolute improvement on the SR and about 2% absolute improvement on Success weighted by inverse Path Length (SPL), i.e., presents higher efficiency."}

The existing MOTS studies face two critical challenges: 1) the published datasets inadequately capture the real-world complexity for network training to address various driving settings; 2) the working pipeline annotation tool is under-studied in the literature to improve the quality of MOTS learning examples. In this work, we introduce the DG-Labeler and DGL-MOTS dataset to facilitate the training data annotation for the MOST task and accordingly improve network training accuracy and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, our DG-Labeler is the first tool publicly available for MOTS data annotation. DG-Labeler uses the novel Depth-Granularity Module to depict the instance spatial relations and produce fine-grained instance masks. Annotated by DG-Labeler, our DGL-MOTS dataset exceeds the prior effort (i.e., KITTI MOTS and BDD100K) in data diversity, annotation quality, and temporal representations. Results on extensive cross-dataset evaluations indicate significant performance improvements for several state-of-the-art methods trained on our DGL-MOTS dataset.

An AV must drive safely towards its destination, avoiding obstacles, and respond quickly when the vehicle must stop. Any transient errors in software calculations or hardware memory in these deepnet applications can potentially lead to dramatically incorrect results. Therefore, assessing and mitigating any transient errors and providing robust results are important for safety-critical systems. Previous research on this subject focused on detecting errors and then recovering from the errors by re-running the network. Other approaches were based on the extent of full network duplication such as the ensemble learning-based approach to boost system fault-tolerance by leveraging each model's advantages. However, it is hard to detect errors in a deep neural network, and the computational overhead of full redundancy can be substantial. We first study the impact of the error types and locations in deepnets. We next focus on selecting which part should be duplicated using multiple ranking methods to measure the order of importance among neurons. We find that the duplication overhead for computation and memory is a trade-off between algorithmic performance and robustness. To achieve higher robustness with less system overhead, we present two error protection mechanisms that only duplicate parts of the network from critical neurons. Finally, we substantiate the practical feasibility of our approach and evaluate the improvement in the accuracy of a deepnet in the presence of errors. We demonstrate these results using a case study with real-world applications on an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070Ti GPU and an Nvidia Xavier embedded platform used by automotive OEMs."}

To this end, we propose a gradually shrinking GAN (PPCD-GAN) by introducing progressive pruning residual block (PP-Res) and class-aware distillation. The PP-Res is an extension of the conventional residual block where each convolutional layer is followed by a learnable mask layer to progressively prune network parameters as training proceeds. The class-aware distillation, on the other hand, enhances the stability of training by transferring immense knowledge from a well-trained teacher model through instructive attention maps. We train the pruning and distillation processes simultaneously on a well-known GAN architecture in an end-to-end manner. After training, all redundant parameters as well as the mask layers are discarded, yielding a lighter network while retaining the performance. We comprehensively illustrate, on ImageNet 128 x 128 dataset, PPCD-GAN reduces up to 5.2x (81%) parameters against state-of-the-arts while keeping better performance."}

While depth- and RGB-based pose refinement approaches increase the accuracy of the resulting pose estimates, they are susceptible to ambiguity in the observation as they consider visual alignment. We propose to leverage the fact that we often observe static, rigid scenes. Thus, the objects therein need to be under physically plausible poses. We show that considering plausibility reduces ambiguity and, in consequence, allows poses to be more accurately predicted in cluttered environments. To this end, we extend a recent RL-based registration approach towards iterative refinement of object poses. Experiments on the LINEMOD and YCB-VIDEO datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our depth-based refinement approach."}

While recently proposed models for such data setup achieve high accuracy metrics, their complexity is a limiting factor for real-time processing. In this paper, we propose a real-time model and analytically derive its relationship to prior methods. Our CFLOW-AD model is based on a conditional normalizing flow framework adopted for anomaly detection with localization. In particular, CFLOW-AD consists of a discriminatively pretrained encoder followed by a multi-scale generative decoders where the latter explicitly estimate likelihood of the encoded features. Our approach results in a computationally and memory-efficient model: CFLOW-AD is faster and smaller by a factor of 10x than prior state-of-the-art with the same input setting. Our experiments on the MVTec dataset show that CFLOW-AD outperforms previous methods by 0.36% AUROC in detection task, by 1.12% AUROC and 2.5% AUPRO in localization task, respectively.

The DP sensor was developed to improve how cameras perform autofocus. Since the DP sensor's introduction, researchers have found additional uses for the DP data, such as depth estimation, reflection removal, and defocus deblurring. We are interested in the latter task of defocus deblurring. In particular, we propose a single-image deblurring network that incorporates the two sub-aperture views into a multi-task framework. Specifically, we show that jointly learning to predict the two DP views from a single blurry input image improves the network's ability to learn to deblur the image. Our experiments show this multi-task strategy achieves +1dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art defocus deblurring methods. In addition, our multi-task framework allows accurate DP-view synthesis (e.g.,  39dB PSNR) from the single input image. These high-quality DP views can be used for other DP-based applications, such as reflection removal. As part of this effort, we have captured a new dataset of 7,059 high-quality images to support our training for the DP-view synthesis task."}

However, it is very dependent on the performance of the detector. When the detector has a behavior of missing detection, the tracking result will be directly affected. In this paper, we analyze the phenomenon of the lost tracking object in real-time tracking model on MOT2020 dataset. Based on simple and traditional methods, we propose a compensation tracker to further alleviate the lost tracking problem caused by missing detection. It consists of a motion compensation module and an object selection module. The proposed method not only can re-track missing tracking objects from lost objects, but also does not require additional networks so as to maintain speed-accuracy trade-off of the real-time model. Our method only needs to be embedded into the tracker to work without re-training the network. Experiments show that the compensation tracker can efficaciously improve the performance of the model and reduce identity switches. With limited costs, the compensation tracker successfully enhances the baseline tracking performance by a large margin and reaches 66% of MOTA and 67% of IDF1 on MOT2020 dataset."}

Our controllable approach enables variable-length generations customizable by action category, across more than 100 categories. To enable intra/inter-category diversity, we model the latent generative space using a Conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder. To enable realistic generation of actions involving locomotion, we decouple local pose and global trajectory components of the action sequence. We incorporate duration-aware feature representations to enable variable-length sequence generation. We use a hybrid pose sequence representation with 3D pose sequences sourced from videos and 3D Kinect-based sequences of NTU-RGBD-120. To enable principled comparison of generation quality, we employ suitably modified strong baselines during evaluation. Although smaller and simpler compared to baselines, MUGL provides better quality generations, paving the way for practical and controllable large-scale human action generation."}

However, traditional people detection and tracking algorithms developed for side-mounted, rectilinear-lens cameras do not work well on images from overhead fisheye cameras due to their viewpoint and unique optics. While several people-detection algorithms have been recently developed for such cameras, they have all been tested on datasets consisting of \"staged\" recordings with a limited variety of people, scenes and challenges. Clearly, the performance of these algorithms \"in the wild\", i.e., on recordings with real-world challenges, remains unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of in-the-Wild Events for People Detection and Tracking from Overhead Fisheye cameras (WEPDTOF). The dataset features 14 YouTube videos captured in a wide range of scenes, 188 distinct person identities consistently labeled across time, and real-world challenges such as extreme occlusions and camouflage. Also, we propose 3 spatio-temporal extensions of a state-of-the-art people-detection algorithm to enhance the coherence of detections across time. Compared to top-performing algorithms, that are purely spatial, the new algorithms offer a significant performance improvement on the new dataset.

In this paper, we propose an efficient low displacement rank (LDR) regularization strategy termed Ortho-Shot; a technique that imposes orthogonal regularization on the convolutional layers of a few-shot classifier, which is based on the doubly-block toeplitz (DBT) matrix structure. The regularized convolutional layers of the few-shot classifier enhances model generalization and intra-class feature embeddings that are crucial for few-shot learning. Overfitting is a typical issue for few-shot models, the lack of data diversity inhibits proper model inference which weakens the classification accuracy of few-shot learners to novel classes. In this regard, we broke down the pipeline of the few-shot classifier and established that the support, query and task data augmentation collectively alleviates overfitting in networks. With compelling results, we demonstrated that combining a DBT-based low-rank orthogonal regularizer with data augmentation strategies, significantly boosts the performance of a few-shot classifier. We perform our experiments on the miniImagenet, CIFAR-FS and Stanford datasets with performance values of about 5% when compared to state-of-the-art."}

Such attacks are carefully crafted imperceptible noises that can fool the network and can cause severe consequences when deployed. To encounter them, the model requires training data for adversarial training or explicit regularization-based techniques. However, privacy has become an important concern, restricting access to only trained models but not the training data (e.g. biometric data). Also, data curation is expensive and companies may have proprietary rights over it. To handle such situations, we propose a completely novel problem of \"test-time adversarial defense in absence of training data and even their statistics\". We solve it in two stages: a) detection and b) correction of adversarial samples. Our adversarial sample detection framework is initially trained on arbitrary data and is subsequently adapted to the unlabelled test data through unsupervised domain adaptation. We further correct the predictions on detected adversarial samples by transforming them in Fourier domain and obtaining their low frequency component at our proposed suitable radius for model prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed technique via extensive experiments against several adversarial attacks and for different model architectures and datasets. For a non-robust Resnet-18 model pretrained on CIFAR-10, our detection method correctly identifies 91.42% adversaries. Also, we significantly improve the adversarial accuracy from 0% to 37.37% with a minimal drop of 0.02% in clean accuracy on state-of-the-art \"Auto Attack\" without having to retrain the model."}

Su et al., 2020 used an auto-encoder architecture and an image reconstruction objective function to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the NTU60 C-View benchmark. Rao et al., 2020 used Contrastive learning in the latent space to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the NTU60 C-Sub benchmark. Here, we reconcile these disparate approaches by developing a taxonomy of self-supervised learning for action recognition. We observe that leading approaches generally use one of two types of objective functions: those that seek to reconstruct the input from a latent representation (\"Attractive\" learning) versus those that also try to maximize the representations distinctiveness (\"Contrastive\" learning). Independently, leading approaches also differ in how they implement these objective functions: there are those that optimize representations in the decoder output space and those which optimize representations in the network's latent space (encoder output). We find that combining these approaches leads to larger gains in performance and tolerance to transformation than is achievable by any individual method, leading to state-of-the-art performance on three standard action recognition datasets.

Existing face rotation or de-occlusion methods only have emphasized the aspect of each problem. In addition, the lack of high-quality paired data remains an obstacle for both methods. In this work, we present a self-supervision strategy called Swap-R&R to overcome the lack of ground-truth in a fully unsupervised manner for joint face rotation and de-occlusion. To generate an input pair for self-supervision, we transfer the occlusion from a face in an image to an estimated 3D face and create a damaged face image, as if rotated from a different pose by rotating twice with the roughly de-occluded face. Furthermore, we propose Complete Face Recovery GAN (CFR-GAN) to restore the collapsed textures and disappeared occlusion areas by leveraging the structural and textural differences between two rendered images. Unlike previous works, which have selected occlusion-free images to obtain ground-truths, our approach does not require human intervention and paired data. We show that our proposed method can generate a de-occluded frontal face image from an occluded profile face image. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can boost the performance of facial recognition and facial expression recognition. The code is publicly available."}

Meanwhile, an effective mode selection scheme is introduced to automatically resolve the conflicting cases between global pose and part detections.

The proposed TA-Net has a multitask learning architecture and enhances the generalization of gland segmentation by learning shared representation from two tasks: instance segmentation and gland topology estimation. The proposed topology loss computes gland topology using gland skeletons and markers. It drives the network to generate segmentation results that comply with the true gland topology. We validate the proposed approach on the GlaS and CRAG datasets using three quantitative metrics, F1-score, object-level Dice coefficient, and object-level Hausdorff distance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the two datasets. TA-Net outperforms other approaches in the presence of densely clustered glands."}

However, in order to map deep neural network (DNN) based object detection models to edge devices, one typically needs to compress such models significantly, thus compromising the model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel edge GPU friendly module for multi-scale feature interaction by exploiting missing combinatorial connections between various feature scales in existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we propose a novel transfer learning backbone adoption inspired by the changing translational information flow across various tasks, designed to complement our feature interaction module and together improve both accuracy as well as execution speed on various edge GPU devices available in the market. For instance, YOLO-ReT with MobileNetV2x0.75 backbone runs real-time on Jetson Nano, and achieves 68.75 mAP on Pascal VOC and 34.91 mAP on COCO, beating its peers by 3.05 mAP and 0.91 mAP respectively, while executing faster by 3.05 FPS. Furthermore, introducing our multi-scale feature interaction module in YOLOv4-tiny and YOLOv4-tiny (3l) improves their performance to 41.5 and 48.1 mAP respectively on COCO, outperforming the original versions by 1.3 and 0.9 mAP."}

In this paper, we propose an effective and flexible framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation using a small set of fully labeled images and a set of weakly labeled images with bounding box labels. In our framework, position and class priors are designed to guide the annotation network to predict accurate pseudo masks for weakly labeled images, which are used to train the segmentation network. We also propose a mixed-dual-head training method to reduce the interference of label noise while enabling the training process more stable. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and can achieve competitive results even with very few fully labeled images. Furthermore, the performance can be further boosted with extra weakly labeled images from COCO dataset."}

Moreover, gaze annotation is a time-consuming process and requires specialized hardware setups. We propose MTGLS: a Multi-Task Gaze estimation framework with Limited Supervision, which leverages abundantly available non-annotated facial image data. MTGLS distills knowledge from off-the-shelf facial image analysis models, and learns strong feature representations of human eyes, guided by three complementary auxiliary signals: (a) the line of sight of the pupil (i.e. pseudo-gaze) defined by the localized facial landmarks, (b) the head-pose given by Euler angles, and (c) the orientation of the eye patch (left/right eye). To overcome inherent noise in the supervisory signals, MTGLS further incorporates a noise distribution modelling approach. Our experimental results show that MTGLS learns highly generalized representations which consistently perform well on a range of datasets. Our proposed framework outperforms the unsupervised state-of-the-art on CAVE (by approx. 6.43%) and even supervised state-of-the-art methods on Gaze360 (by approx. 6.59%) datasets."}

We then train a simple prototype based model over different splits of pseudo masks and augmentations of images. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach achieves promising results, highlighting the potential of self-supervised training. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that addresses unsupervised few-shot segmentation problem on natural images."}

Inspired by the recent success to consider spatial-temporal information for space-time super-resolution, our main goal in this work is to take full considerations of spatial and temporal correlations within the video sequences of fast dynamic events. To this end, we propose a novel one-stage memory enhanced graph attention network (MEGAN) for space-time video super-resolution. Specifically, we build a novel long-range memory graph aggregation (LMGA) module to dynamically capture correlations along the channel dimensions of the feature maps and adaptively aggregate channel features to enhance the feature representations. We introduce a non-local residual block, which enables each channel-wise feature to attend global spatial hierarchical features. In addition, we adopt a progressive fusion module to further enhance the representation ability by extensively exploiting spatio-temporal correlations from multiple frames. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves better results compared with the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and visually."}

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a promising approach to adapt detectors for new domains/environments without any expensive label cost. Previous mainstream UDA works for object detection usually focused on image-level and/or feature-level adaptation by using adversarial learning methods. In this work, we show that such adversarial-based methods can only reduce the domain style gap, but cannot address the domain content gap that is also important for object detectors. To overcome this limitation, we propose the SC-UDA framework to concurrently reduce both gaps: We propose fine-grained domain style transfer to reduce the style gaps with finer image details preserved for detecting small objects; Then we leverage the pseudo-label-based self-training to reduce content gaps; To address pseudo label error accumulation during self-training, novel optimizations are proposed, including uncertainty-based pseudo labeling and imbalanced mini-batch sampling strategy. Experiment results show that our approach consistently outperforms prior stat-of-the-art methods (up to 8.6%, 2.7%, and 2.5% mAP on three UDA benchmarks)."}

In recent years, point cloud representation in 2D space has attracted increasing research interest since it exposes the local geometry features in a 2D space. By projecting those points to a 2D feature map, the relationship between points is inherited in the context between pixels, which are further extracted by a 2D convolutional neural network. However, existing 2D representing methods are either accuracy limited or time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D representation method that projects a point cloud onto an ellipsoid surface space, where local patterns are well exposed in ellipsoid-level and point-level. Additionally, a novel convolutional neural network named EllipsoidNet is proposed to utilize those features for point cloud classification and segmentation applications. The proposed methods are evaluated in ModelNet40 and ShapeNet benchmarks, where the advantages are clearly shown over existing 2D representation methods."}

This has led to an effective rank-based channel pruning algorithm, yet the constant rank phenomenon remains mysterious and unexplained. This work aims at demystifying and interpreting such rank behavior from a frequency-domain perspective, which as a bonus suggests an extremely efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based metric for measuring channel importance without explicitly computing its rank. We achieve remarkable CNN channel pruning based on this analytically sound and computationally efficient metric, and adopt it for repetitive pruning to demonstrate robustness via our scheme named Energy-Zoned Channels for Robust Output Pruning (EZCrop), which shows consistently better results than other state-of-the-art channel pruning methods.

Existing methods rely either on optical flow regularization or fine-tuning with test data to attain temporal consistency. However, optical flow is not always avail-able and reliable. Besides, it is expensive to compute. Fine-tuning the original model in test time is cost sensitive. This paper presents an efficient, intuitive, and unsupervised online adaptation method, AuxAdapt, for improving the temporal consistency of most neural network models. It does not require optical flow and only takes one pass of the video. Since inconsistency mainly arises from the model's uncertainty in its output, we propose an adaptation scheme where the model learns from its own segmentation decisions as it streams a video, which allows producing more confident and temporally consistent labeling for similarly-looking pixels across frames. For stability and efficiency, we leverage a small auxiliary segmentation network (AuxNet) to assist with this adaptation. More specifically, AuxNet readjusts the decision of the original segmentation network (Main-Net) by adding its own estimations to that of MainNet. At every frame, only AuxNet is updated via back-propagation while keeping MainNet fixed. We extensively evaluate our test-time adaptation approach on standard video benchmarks, including Cityscapes, CamVid, and KITTI. The results demonstrate that our approach provides label-wise accurate, temporally consistent, and computationally efficient adaptation (5+ folds overhead reduction comparing to state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods)."}

Increasingly, DL models are applied in healthcare settings with seemingly high levels of performance on-par with medical experts. Yet, very few are deployed into real-life scenarios with variable success rate. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of trust in those models by medical professionals driven by the black-box nature of the deployed models. Numerous explainable techniques have been developed to alleviate this issue by providing a view on how the model reached a given decision. Recent studies have shown that those explanations can expose the models' reliance on areas of the feature space that has no justifiable medical interpretation, widening the gap with the medical experts. In this paper we evaluate the deviation of saliency maps produced by DL classification models from radiologist's eye-gaze while they study the MIMIC-CXR-EGD images, and we propose a novel model architecture that utilises model explanations during training only (i.e. not during inference) to improve the overall plausibility of the model explanations. We substantially improve the similarity between the model's explanations and radiologists' eye-gaze data, reducing Kullback-Leibler Divergence by 90% and increasing Normalised Scanpath Saliency by 216%. We argue that this significant improvement is an important step towards building more robust and interpretable DL solutions in healthcare."}

Recent W-VLP methods, which pair visual features with object tags, help achieve performances comparable with some VLP models trained with aligned pairs in various V-L downstream tasks. This, however, is not the case in cross- modal retrieval (XMR). We argue that the learning of such a W-VLP model is curbed and biased by the object tags of limited semantics. We address the lack of paired V-L data for model supervision with a novel Visual Vocabulary based Feature Hallucinator (WFH), which is trained via weak supervision as a W-VLP model, not requiring images paired with captions. WFH generates visual hallucinations from texts, which are then paired with the originally unpaired texts, allowing more diverse interactions across modalities. Empirically, WFH consistently boosts the prior W-VLP works, e.g. U-VisualBERT (U-VB), over a variety of V-L tasks, i.e. XMR, Visual Question Answering, etc. Notably, benchmarked with recall@ 1,5,10 , it consistently improves U-VB on image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval on two popular datasets Flickr30K and MSCOCO. Meanwhile, it gains by at least 14.5% in cross-dataset generalization tests on these XMR tasks. Moreover, in other V-L downstream tasks considered, our WFH models are on par with models trained with paired V-L data, revealing the utility of unpaired data. These results demonstrate greater generalization of the proposed W-VLP model with WFH."}

One of the most popular SSL approaches is pseudo-labeling (PL). PL approaches assign labels to unlabeled data before re-training the model with a combination of labeled and pseudo-labeled data. However, PL methods are severely degraded by noise and are prone to over-fitting to noisy labels, due to the inclusion of erroneous high confidence pseudo-labels generated from poorly calibrated models, thus, rendering threshold-based selection ineffective. Moreover, the combinatorial complexity of the hypothesis space and the error accumulation due to multiple incorrect autoregressive steps posit pseudo-labeling challenging for sequential self-training. To this end, we propose a pseudo-label generation and an uncertainty-based data selection framework for semi-supervised text recognition. We first use Beam-Search inference to yield highly probable hypotheses to assign pseudo-labels to the unlabelled examples. Then we adopt an ensemble of models, sampled by applying dropout, to obtain a robust estimate of the uncertainty associated with the prediction, considering both the character-level and word-level predictive distribution to select good quality pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on several benchmark handwriting and scene-text datasets show that our method outperforms the baseline approaches and the previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised text-recognition methods."}

Even though existing approaches can successfully transfer style information, arbitrary style transfer still faces many challenges, such as the content leak issue. To be specific, the embedding of artistic style can lead to content changes. In this paper, we solve the content leak problem from the perspective of image restoration. In particular, an iterative architecture is proposed to achieve the restorable arbitrary style transfer (RAST), which can realize the transmission of both content and style information through the multi-restorations. We control the content-style balance in stylized images by the accuracy of image restoration. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed RAST architecture, we design two novel loss functions: multi-restoration loss and style difference loss. In addition, we propose a new quantitative evaluation method to measure content preservation performance and style embedding performance. Comprehensive experiments comparing with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our proposed architecture can produce stylized images with superior performance on content preservation and style embedding."}

Recent works show promising results on single datasets. Nevertheless, the generalization ability of these methods under different attribute distributions, viewpoints, varying illumination, and low resolutions remains rarely understood due to strong biases and varying attributes in current datasets. To close this gap and support a systematic investigation, we present UPAR, the Unified Person Attribute Recognition Dataset. It is based on four well-known person attribute recognition datasets: PA100K, PETA, RAPv2, and Market1501. We unify those datasets by providing 3,3M additional annotations to harmonize 40 important binary attributes over 12 attribute categories across the datasets. We thus enable research on generalizable pedestrian attribute recognition as well as attribute-based person retrieval for the first time. Due to the vast variance of the image distribution, pedestrian pose, scale, and occlusion, existing approaches are greatly challenged both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we develop a strong baseline for PAR and attribute-based person retrieval based on a thorough analysis of regularization methods. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain and specialization settings on PA100k, PETA, RAPv2, Market1501-Attributes, and UPAR.

In recent years, several adaptive momentum based SGD optimizers have been introduced, such as Adam, diffGrad, Radam and AdaBelief. However, the existing SGD optimizers do not exploit the gradient norm of past iterations and lead to poor convergence and performance. In this paper, we propose a novel AdaNorm based SGD optimizers by correcting the norm of gradient in each iteration based on the adaptive training history of gradient norm. By doing so, the proposed optimizers are able to maintain high and representive gradient throughout the training and solves the low and atypical gradient problems. The proposed concept is generic and can be used with any existing SGD optimizer.

Domain-specific challenges associated with visual scenes in movies include transitions, person coverage, and a wide array of real-life and fictional scenarios. Existing visual scene datasets in movies have limited taxonomies and don't consider the visual scene transition within movie clips. In this work, we address the problem of visual scene recognition in movies by first automatically curating a new and extensive movie-centric taxonomy of 179 scene labels derived from movie scripts and auxiliary web-based video datasets. Instead of manual annotations which can be expensive, we use CLIP to weakly label 1.12 million shots from 32K movie clips based on our proposed taxonomy. We provide baseline visual models trained on the weakly labeled dataset called MovieCLIP and evaluate them on an independent dataset verified by human raters. We show that leveraging features from models pretrained on MovieCLIP benefits downstream tasks such as multi-label scene and genre classification of web videos and movie trailers."}

Therefore, TI2Net is a reference-agnostic detector and can be used on unseen datasets. For a video clip of a given identity, identity information in all frames will first be encoded to identity vectors. TI2Net learns the temporal identity embedding from the temporal difference of the identity vectors. The temporal embedding, representing the identity inconsistency in the video clip, is finally used to determine the authenticity of the video clip. During training, TI2Net incorporates triplet loss to learn more discriminative temporal embeddings. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed TI2Net. Experimental results indicate that TI2Net generalizes well to unseen manipulations and datasets with unseen identities.

The commonly used paradigm to categorize pathology images is patch-based processing, which often incorporates multiple instance learning MIL to aggregate local patch-level representations yielding image-level prediction. Nonetheless, diagnostically relevant regions may only take a small fraction of the whole tissue, and current MIL-based approaches often process images uniformly, discarding the inter-patches interactions. To alleviate these issues, we propose ScoreNet, a new efficient transformer that exploits a differentiable recommendation stage to extract discriminative image regions and dedicate computational resources accordingly. The proposed transformer leverages the local and global attention of a few dynamically recommended high-resolution regions at an efficient computational cost. We further introduce a novel mixing data-augmentation, namely ScoreMix, by leveraging the image's semantic distribution to guide the data mixing and produce coherent sample-label pairs. ScoreMix is embarrassingly simple and mitigates the pitfalls of previous augmentations, which assume a uniform semantic distribution and risk mislabeling the samples. Thorough experiments and ablation studies on three breast cancer histology datasets of Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) have validated the superiority of our approach over prior arts, including transformer-based models on tumour regions-of-interest TRoIs classification. ScoreNet equipped with proposed ScoreMix augmentation demonstrates better generalization capabilities and achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with only 50% of the data compared to other mixing augmentation variants. Finally, ScoreNet yields high efficacy and outperforms SOTA efficient transformers, namely TransPath and SwinTransformer, with throughput around 3x and 4x higher than the aforementioned architectures, respectively."}

Keypoint detection differs from other visual tasks where contrastive learning has been applied because the input is a set of images in which multiple keypoints are annotated. This requires the contrastive learning to be extended such that the keypoints are represented and detected independently, which enables the contrastive loss to make the keypoint features different from each other and from the background. Our approach has two benefits: It enables us to exploit the power of contrastive learning for keypoint detection, and by detecting each keypoint independently the detection becomes more robust to occlusion compared to holistic methods, such as stacked hourglass networks, which attempt to detect all keypoints jointly. Our CoKe framework introduces several technical innovations. In particular, we introduce: (i) A clutter bank to represent non-keypoint features; (ii) a keypoint bank that stores prototypical representations of keypoints to approximate the contrastive loss between keypoints; and (iii) a cumulative moving average update to learn the keypoint prototypes while training the feature extractor. Our experiments on a range of diverse datasets (PASCAL3D+, MPII, ObjectNet3D) show that our approach works as well, or better than, alternative methods for keypoint detection, even for human keypoints, for which the literature is vast. Moreover, we observe that CoKe is exceptionally robust to partial occlusion and previously unseen object poses."}

However, there present many challenges for the existing ultra-FGVC methods, firstly there are always not enough samples in the existing ultra-FGVC datasets based on which the models can easily get overfitting. Secondly, in practice, we are likely to find new species that we have not seen before and need to add them to existing models, which is known as incremental learning. The existing methods solve these problems by Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL), but the main challenge of the FSCIL models on ultra-FGVC tasks lies in their inferior discrimination detection ability since they usually use low-capacity networks to extract features, which leads to insufficient discriminative details extraction from ultra-fine-grained images. In this paper, a self-supervised feature enhancement for the few-shot incremental learning network (SSFE-Net) is proposed to solve this problem. Specifically, a self-supervised learning (SSL) and knowledge distillation (KD) framework is developed to enhance the feature extraction of the low-capacity backbone network for ultra-FGVC few-shot class incremental learning tasks. Besides, we for the first time create a series of benchmarks for FSCIL tasks on two public ultra-FGVC datasets and three normal fine-grained datasets, which will facilitate the development of the Ultra-FGVC community.

Such models are trained on large-scale datasets that contain millions of real human face images collected from the internet. Web-crawled face images are severely biased (in terms of race, lighting, make-up, etc) and often contain label noise. More importantly, the face images are collected without explicit consent, raising ethical concerns. To avoid such problems, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset for face recognition, obtained by rendering digital faces using a computer graphics pipeline. We first demonstrate that aggressive data augmentation can significantly reduce the synthetic-to-real domain gap. Having full control over the rendering pipeline, we also study how each attribute (e.g., variation in facial pose, accessories and textures) affects the accuracy. Compared to SynFace, a recent method trained on GAN-generated synthetic faces, we reduce the error rate on LFW by 52.5% (accuracy from 91.93% to 96.17%). By fine-tuning the network on a smaller number of real face images that could reasonably be obtained with consent, we achieve accuracy that is comparable to the methods trained on millions of real face images."}

However, the massive computation brought from the full attention mechanism became a heavy burden for memory consumption. Sequentially, the limitation of memory consumption hinders the deployment of the Transformer model on the embedded system where the computing resources are limited. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel memory economy attention mechanism named Couplformer, which decouples the attention map into two sub-matrices and generates the alignment scores from spatial information. Our method enables the Transformer model to improve time and memory efficiency while maintaining expressive power. A series of different scale image classification tasks are applied to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. The result of experiments shows that on the ImageNet-1K classification task, the Couplformer can significantly decrease 42% memory consumption compared with the regular Transformer. Meanwhile, it accesses sufficient accuracy requirements, which outperforms 0.56% on Top-1 accuracy and occupies the same memory footprint. Besides, the Couplformer achieves state-of-art performance in MS COCO 2017 object detection and instance segmentation tasks. As a result, the Couplformer can serve as an efficient backbone in visual tasks and provide a novel perspective on deploying attention mechanisms for researchers."}

Parsing such visually-rich documents is a core task for workflow automation, but it remains challenging since most documents do not encode explicit layout information, e.g., how characters and words are grouped into boxes and ordered into larger semantic entities. Current state-of-the-art layout extraction methods are challenged on such documents as they rely on word sequences to have correct reading order and do not exploit their hierarchical structure. We propose LayerDoc, an approach that uses visual features, textual semantics, and spatial coordinates along with constraint inference to extract the hierarchical layout structure of documents in a bottom-up layer-wise fashion. LayerDoc recursively groups smaller regions into larger semantic elements in 2D to infer complex nested hierarchies. Experiments show that our approach outperforms competitive baselines by 10-15% on three diverse datasets of forms and mobile app screen layouts for the tasks of spatial region classification, higher-order group identification, layout hierarchy extraction, reading order detection, and word grouping."}

Such approaches need labeled data to guide the self distillation process. Inspired by self-supervised (SS) learning, we propose a self-supervised self distillation (SSSD) approach in this work. Based on an unlabeled image dataset, a model is constructed to learn visual representations in a self-supervised manner. This pre-trained model is then adopted to extract visual representations of the target dataset and generates pseudo labels via clustering. The pseudo labels guide the SD process, and thus enable SD to proceed in an unsupervised way (no data labels are required at all). We verify this idea based on evaluations on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this unsupervised SD approach. Performance outperforming similar frameworks is also shown."}

Most current endeavors focus on completely cutting the researcher out of the picture by generating highly generalized models. However, these models invariably fail when faced with novel data, distributed differently than the ones used for training. Rather than approaching the problem with methods that presume the availability of large amounts of target data and computing power for retraining, in this work we address the even greater challenge of designing an approach that requires minimal amounts of new annotated data as well as training time. We do so by designing specialized contrastive losses that leverage the few annotated samples very efficiently. A large set of results show that 3 to 5 annotations lead to models with accuracy that: 1) significantly mitigate the covariate shift effects; 2) matches or surpasses other adaptation methods; 3) even approaches methods that have been fully retrained on the target distribution. The adaptation training is only a few minutes, paving a path towards a balance between model performance, computing requirements and expert-level annotation needs."}

Many current panoptic segmentation methods, however, predict masks of semantic classes and object instances in separate branches, yielding inconsistent predictions. Moreover, because state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation models rely on box proposals, the instance masks predicted are often of low-resolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Panoptic Refinement Network (PRN), which takes masks from base panoptic segmentation models and refines them jointly to produce coherent results. PRN extends the offset map-based architecture of Panoptic-Deeplab with several novel ideas including a foreground mask and instance bounding box offsets, as well as coordinate convolutions for improved spatial prediction. Experimental results on COCO and Cityscapes show that PRN can significantly improve already accurate results from a variety of panoptic segmentation networks."}

Triplet loss, popular for metric learning, has made a great success in many computer vision tasks. In this paper, we redesign the patch-based triplet loss in MDE to alleviate the ubiquitous edge-fattening issue. We show two drawbacks of the raw triplet loss in MDE and demonstrate our problem-driven redesigns. First, we present a min. operator based strategy applied to all negative samples, to prevent well-performing negatives sheltering the error of edge-fattening negatives. Second, we split the anchor-positive distance and anchor-negative distance from within the original triplet, which directly optimizes the positives without any mutual effect with the negatives. Extensive experiments show the combination of these two small redesigns can achieve unprecedented results: Our powerful and versatile triplet loss not only makes our model outperform all previous SoTA by a large margin, but also provides substantial performance boosts to a large number of existing models, while introducing no extra inference computation at all."}

We propose a novel solution with a multi-task network that performs monocular depth estimation and video panoptic segmentation. Since acquiring ground truth labels for both depth and image segmentation has a relatively large cost, we leverage the power of unlabeled video sequences with self-supervised monocular depth estimation and semi-supervised learning from pseudo-labels for video panoptic segmentation. To further improve the depth prediction, we introduce panoptic-guided depth losses and a novel panoptic masking scheme for moving objects to avoid corrupting the training signal.

Our key idea is to formulate MVS as an end-to-end learnable network, which we refer to as nLMVS-Net, that seamlessly integrates radiometric cues to leverage surface normals as view-independent surface features for learned cost volume construction and filtering. It first estimates surface normals as pixel-wise probability densities for each view with a novel shape-from-shading network. These per-pixel surface normal densities and the input multi-view images are then input to a novel cost volume filtering network that learns to recover per-pixel depth and surface normal. The reflectance is also explicitly estimated by alternating with geometry reconstruction. Extensive quantitative evaluations on newly established synthetic and real-world datasets show that nLMVS-Net can robustly and accurately recover the shape and reflectance of complex objects in natural settings."}

While event cameras can measure subtle brightness changes in high frame rates, the measurements in low lighting or extreme motion suffer from significant domain discrepancy with complex noise. As a result, the performance of event-based vision tasks does not transfer to challenging environments, where the event cameras are expected to thrive over normal cameras. We find that the multi-view consistency of NeRF provides a powerful self-supervision signal for eliminating spurious measurements and extracting the consistent underlying structure despite highly noisy input. Instead of posed images of the original NeRF, the input to Ev-NeRF is the event measurements accompanied by the movements of the sensors. Using the loss function that reflects the measurement model of the sensor, Ev-NeRF creates an integrated neural volume that summarizes the unstructured and sparse data points captured for about 2-4 seconds. The generated neural volume can also produce intensity images from novel views with reasonable depth estimates, which can serve as a high-quality input to various vision-based tasks. Our results show that Ev-NeRF achieves competitive performance for intensity image reconstruction under extreme noise conditions and high-dynamic-range imaging."}

We argue that depending on the application, users of image retrieval systems have different and changing similarity notions that should be incorporated as easily as possible. Therefore, we present Language-Guided Zero-Shot Deep Metric Learning (LanZ-DML) as a new DML setting in which users control the aspects that should be important for image representations without training data by only using natural language. To this end, we propose InDiReCT (Image representations using Dimensionality Reduction on CLIP embedded Texts), a model for LanZ-DML on images that exclusively uses a few text prompts for training. InDiReCT utilizes CLIP as a fixed feature extractor for images and texts and transfers the variation in text prompt embeddings to the image embedding space. Extensive experiments on five datasets and overall thirteen similarity notions show that, despite not seeing any images during training, InDiReCT performs better than strong baselines and approaches the performance of fully-supervised models. An analysis reveals that InDiReCT learns to focus on regions of the image that correlate with the desired similarity notion, which makes it a fast to train and easy to use method to create custom embedding spaces only using natural language."}

However, real-world computing systems do not always provide stable resource guarantees. Computational resources need to be conserved when load from other processes is high, or available memory is low. In this work, we present a training procedure to produce DNNs that can be compressed in real-time to arbitrary compression levels entirely on-device. This enables the deployment of a single model that can efficiently adapt to its host device's available resources. We formulate this problem as learning an adaptively compressible network subspace, where one end is optimized for accuracy, and the other for efficiency. Our subspace model requires no recalibration nor retraining when changing compression levels. Moreover, our generic training framework is amenable to multiple forms of compression, and we present results for unstructured sparsity, structured sparsity, and quantization on a variety of architectures. We present models that require a single extra copy of network parameters, as well as models that require no extra parameters. Both models allow for operation at any compression level within a wide range (for example, 0% to 90% for structured sparsity with ResNet18 on ImageNet). At each compression level, our models achieve an accuracy comparable to a baseline model optimized for that particular compression level. To our knowledge, our method is the first to enable adaptive on-device network compression with little to no computational overhead."}

In object detection, the bias exists in the form of various imbalances such as class, background-foreground, and object size. In this paper, we denote size of an object as the number of pixels it covers in an image and size imbalance as the over-representation of certain sizes of objects in a dataset. We aim to address the problem of size imbalance in drone-based aerial image datasets. Existing methods for solving size imbalance are based on architectural changes that utilize multiple scales of images or feature maps for detecting objects of different sizes. We, on the other hand, propose a novel ARchitectUre-agnostic BAlanced Loss (ARUBA) that can be applied as a plugin on top of any object detection model. It follows a neighborhood-driven approach inspired by the ordinality of object size. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments on aerial datasets such as HRSC2016, DOTAv1.0, DOTAv1.5 and VisDrone and obtain consistent improvement in performance."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2023", "Area": "CV", "Where": "WACV", "Abbreviation": "FUSSL", "Title": "Fuzzy Uncertain Self Supervised Learning", "Abstract": "Self supervised learning (SSL) has become a very successful technique to harness the power of unlabeled data, with no annotation effort. A number of developed approaches are evolving with the goal of outperforming supervised alternatives, which have been relatively successful. Similar to some other disciplines in deep representation learning, one main issue in SSL is robustness of the approaches under different settings. In this paper, for the first time, we recognize the fundamental limits of SSL coming from the use of a single-supervisory signal. To address this limitation, we leverage the power of uncertainty representation to devise a robust and general standard hierarchical learning/training protocol for any SSL baseline, regard- less of their assumptions and approaches. Essentially, using the information bottleneck principle, we decompose feature learning into a two-stage training procedure, each with a distinct supervision signal. This double supervision approach is captured in two key steps: 1) invariance enforcement to data augmentation, and 2) fuzzy pseudo labeling (both hard and soft annotation). This simple, yet, effective protocol which enables cross-class/cluster feature learning, is instantiated via an initial training of an ensemble of models through invariance enforcement to data augmentation as first training phase, and then assigning fuzzy labels to the original samples for the second training phase. We consider multiple alternative scenarios with double supervision and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on recent baselines, covering four different SSL paradigms, including geometrical, contrastive, non-contrastive, and hard/soft whitening (redundancy reduction) baselines. We performed extensive experiments under multiple settings to show that the proposed training protocol consistently improves the performance of the former baselines, independent of their respective underlying principles."}

Models such as neural radiance fields (NeRF), which uses relatively small neural networks, can represent high-quality scenes and achieve state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. Training these types of networks, however, is still computationally expensive and the model struggles with real life 360 degree scenes. In this work, we propose the depth distribution neural radiance field (DDNeRF), a new method that significantly increases sampling efficiency along rays during training, while achieving superior results for a given sampling budget. DDNeRF achieves this performance by learning a more accurate representation of the density distribution along rays. More specifically, the proposed framework trains a coarse model to predict the internal distribution of the transparency of an input volume along each ray. This estimated distribution then guides the sampling procedure of the fine model. Our method allows using fewer samples during training while achieving better output quality with the same computational resources."}

The benchmark consists of 581 high-quality videos, which have 436K frames densely annotated with rotated bounding boxes for the targets spanning 74 object classes. The dataset is geared for development, evaluation and analysis of visual tracking algorithms that are robust to occlusions. It is comprised of videos with high occlusion levels, where the median percentage of occluded frames per-video is 68%. It also provides critical attributes on occlusions, which include defining a taxonomy for occluders, providing occlusion masks for every bounding box, per-frame partial/full occlusion labels and more. HOOT has been compiled to encourage development of new methods targeting occlusion handling in visual tracking, by providing training and test splits with high occlusion levels. This makes HOOT the first densely-annotated, large dataset designed for single-object tracking under severe occlusion. We evaluate 15 state-of-the-art trackers on this new dataset to act as a baseline for future work focusing on occlusions."}

The traditional wisdom in this space is to employ sign() for binarizing featuremaps. We argue and illustrate that sign() is a uniqueness bottleneck, limiting information propagation throughout the network. To alleviate this, we propose to dispense sign(), replacing it with a learnable activation binarizer (LAB), allowing the network to learn a fine-grained binarization kernel per layer - as opposed to global thresholding. LAB is a novel universal module that can seamlessly be integrated into existing architectures. To confirm this, we plug it into four seminal BNNs and show a considerable performance boost at the cost of tolerable increase in delay and complexity. Finally, we build an end-to-end BNN (coined as LAB-BNN) around LAB, and demonstrate that it achieves competitive performance on par with the state-of-the-art on ImageNet.

We argue that this is because the rotated image is always treated as either positive or negative. The semantics of an image can be rotation-invariant or rotation-variant, so whether the rotated image is treated as positive or negative should be determined based on the content of the image. Therefore, we propose a novel augmentation strategy, adaptive Positive or Negative Data Augmentation (PNDA), in which an original and its rotated image are a positive pair if they are semantically close and a negative pair if they are semantically different. To achieve PNDA, we first determine whether rotation is positive or negative on an image-by-image basis in an unsupervised way. Then, we apply PNDA to contrastive learning frameworks. Our experiments showed that PNDA improves the performance of contrastive learning."}

Far3Det is particularly important for autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating at highway speeds, which require detections of far-field obstacles to ensure sufficient braking distances. However, contemporary AV benchmarks such as nuScenes underemphasize this problem because they evaluate performance only up to a certain distance (50m). One reason is that obtaining far-field 3D annotations is difficult, particularly for lidar sensors that produce very few point returns for far-away objects. Indeed, we find that almost 50% of far-field objects (beyond 50m) contain zero lidar points. Secondly, current metrics for 3D detection employ a \"one-size-fits-all\" philosophy, using the same tolerance thresholds for near and far objects, inconsistent with tolerances for both human vision and stereo disparities. Both factors lead to an incomplete analysis of the Far3Det task. For example, while conventional wisdom tells us that high-resolution RGB sensors should be vital for the 3D detection of far-away objects, lidar-based methods still rank higher compared to RGB counterparts on the current benchmark leaderboards. As a first step towards a Far3Det benchmark, we develop a method to find well-annotated scenes from the nuScenes dataset and derive a well-annotated far-field validation set. We also propose a Far3Det evaluation protocol and explore various 3D detection methods for Far3Det. Our result convincingly justifies the long held conventional wisdom that high-resolution RGB improves 3D detection in the far-field. We further propose a simple yet effective method that fuses detections from RGB and lidar detectors based on non-maximum suppression, which remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art 3D detectors in the far-field."}

However, finding resources to learn or improve one's lipreading skills can be challenging. This is further exacerbated in the COVID19 pandemic due to restrictions on direct interactions with peers and speech therapists. Today, online MOOCs platforms like Coursera and Udemy have become the most effective form of training for many types of skill development. However, online lipreading resources are scarce as creating such resources is an extensive process needing months of manual effort to record hired actors. Because of the manual pipeline, such platforms are also limited in vocabulary, supported languages, accents, and speakers and have a high usage cost. In this work, we investigate the possibility of replacing real human talking videos with synthetically generated videos. Synthetic data can easily incorporate larger vocabularies, variations in accent, and even local languages and many speakers. We propose an end-to-end automated pipeline to develop such a platform using state-of-the-art talking head video generator networks, text-to-speech models, and computer vision techniques. We then perform an extensive human evaluation using carefully thought out lipreading exercises to validate the quality of our designed platform against the existing lipreading platforms. Our studies concretely point toward the potential of our approach in developing a large-scale lipreading MOOC platform that can impact millions of people with hearing loss."}

In this domain, low-rank approximation is a promising method, but existing solutions considered a restricted number of design choices and failed to efficiently explore the design space, which lead to severe accuracy degradation and limited compression ratio achieved. To address the above limitations, this work proposes the SVD-NAS framework that couples the domains of low-rank approximation and neural architecture search. SVD-NAS generalises and expands the design choices of previous works by introducing the Low-Rank architecture space, LR-space, which is a more fine-grained design space of low-rank approximation. Afterwards, this work proposes a gradient-descent-based search for efficiently traversing the LR-space. This finer and more thorough exploration of the possible design choices results in improved accuracy as well as reduction in parameters, FLOPS, and latency of a CNN model. Results demonstrate that the SVD-NAS achieves 2.06-12.85pp higher accuracy on ImageNet than state-of-the-art methods under the data-limited problem settings.

Many recently proposed approaches try to counter this by aligning the model to the new distribution prior to inference. With no labels available this requires unsupervised objectives to adapt the model on the observed test data. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Self-Training (TeST): a technique that takes as input a model trained on some source data and a novel data distribution at test time, and learns invariant and robust representations using a student-teacher framework. We find that models adapted using TeST significantly improve over baseline test-time adaptation algorithms. TeST achieves competitive performance to modern domain adaptation algorithms [4,43], while having access to 5-10x less data at time of adaption. We thoroughly evaluate a variety of baselines on two tasks: object detection and image segmentation and find that models adapted with TeST. We find that TeST sets the new state-of-the art for test-time domain adaptation algorithms."}

An unstructured and complex driving layout found in several developing countries such as India poses a challenge to these models due to the sheer degree of variations in the object types, densities, and locations. To facilitate better research toward accommodating such scenarios, we build a new dataset,  IDD-3D , which consists of multi-modal data from multiple cameras and LiDAR sensors with 12k annotated driving LiDAR frames across various traffic scenarios. We discuss the need for this dataset through statistical comparisons with existing datasets and highlight benchmarks on standard 3D object detection and tracking tasks in complex layouts."}

The widely adopted activation function ReLU despite being simple and effective has few disadvantages including the Dying ReLU problem. In order to tackle such problems, we propose a novel activation function called Serf which is self-regularized and nonmonotonic in nature. Like Mish, Serf also belongs to the Swish family of functions. Based on several experiments on computer vision (image classification and object detection) and natural language processing (machine translation, sentiment classification and multimodal entailment) tasks with different state-of-the-art architectures, it is observed that Serf vastly outperforms ReLU (baseline) and other activation functions including both Swish and Mish, with a markedly bigger margin on deeper architectures. Ablation studies further demonstrate that Serf based architectures perform better than those of Swish and Mish in varying scenarios, validating the effectiveness and compatibility of Serf with varying depth, complexity, optimizers, learning rates, batch sizes, initializers and dropout rates. Finally, we investigate the mathematical relation between Swish and Serf, thereby showing the impact of preconditioner function ingrained in the first derivative of Serf which provides a regularization effect making gradients smoother and optimization faster."}

Precise localization of the AVEs is very challenging since it demands effective multi-modal feature correspondence to ground the short and long range temporal interactions. Existing approaches struggle in capturing the different scales of multi-modal interaction due to ineffective multi-modal training strategies. To overcome this limitation, we introduce AVE-CLIP, a novel framework that integrates the AudioCLIP pre-trained on large-scale audio-visual data with a multi-window temporal transformer to effectively operate on different temporal scales of video frames. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We introduce a multi-stage training framework to incorporate AudioCLIP pre-trained with audio-image pairs into the AVE localization task on video frames through contrastive fine-tuning, effective mean video feature extraction, and multi-scale training phases. (2) We propose a multi-domain attention mechanism that operates on both temporal and feature domains over varying timescales to fuse the local and global feature variations.

Several presentation (adversary) attack detection (PAD) algorithms, including iris PAD, are proposed and have shown superlative performance. However, a recent study, on a small-scale database, has highlighted that iris PAD may have gender biases. In this research, we present a rigorous study on gender bias in iris presentation attack detection algorithms using a large-scale and gender-balanced database. The paper provides several interesting observations which can help in building future presentation attack detection algorithms with aim of fair treatment of each demography. In addition, we also present a robust iris presentation attack detection algorithm by combining gender-covariate biased classifiers. The proposed robust classifier not only reduces the difference in accuracy between different genders but also improves the overall performance of the PAD system."}

In reality, these scenarios are not all represented in the model's training data, leading to poor performance. To tackle this, current training strategies attempt to either exploit additional unlabeled data with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), or to reduce overfitting using the limited available labeled data with domain generalization (DG). However, it is not clear from current literature which of these methods allows for better generalization to unseen data from the wild. Therefore, in this work, we present an evaluation framework in which the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art UDA and DG methods can be compared fairly. From this evaluation, we find that UDA methods, which leverage unlabeled data, outperform DG methods in terms of generalization, and can deliver similar performance on unseen data as fully-supervised training methods that require all data to be labeled. We show that semantic segmentation performance can be increased up to 30% for a priori unknown data without using any extra labeled data."}

We propose a method to generate, select, and encode external commonsense knowledge alongside visual and textual cues in a new pre-trained Vision-Language-Commonsense transformer model, VLC-BERT. Through our evaluation on the knowledge-intensive OK-VQA and A-OKVQA datasets, we show that VLC-BERT is capable of outperforming existing models that utilize static knowledge bases. Furthermore, through a detailed analysis, we explain which questions benefit, and which don't, from contextualized commonsense knowledge from COMET."}

PLS", "Title": "Robustness To Label Noise With Two Stage Detection", "Abstract": "Designing robust algorithms capable of training accurate neural networks on uncurated datasets from the web has been the subject of much research as it reduces the need for time consuming human labor. The focus of many previous research contributions has been on the detection of different types of label noise; however, this paper proposes to improve the correction accuracy of noisy samples once they have been detected. In many state-of-the-art contributions, a two phase approach is adopted where the noisy samples are detected before guessing a corrected pseudo-label in a semi-supervised fashion. The guessed pseudo-labels are then used in the supervised objective without ensuring that the label guess is likely to be correct. This can lead to confirmation bias, which reduces the noise robustness. Here we propose the pseudo-loss, a simple metric that we find to be strongly correlated with pseudo-label correctness on noisy samples. Using the pseudo-loss, we dynamically down weight under-confident pseudo-labels throughout training to avoid confirmation bias and improve the network accuracy. We additionally propose to use a confidence guided contrastive objective that learns robust representation on an interpolated objective between class bound (supervised) for confidently corrected samples and unsupervised representation for under-confident label corrections. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our Pseudo-Loss Selection (PLS) algorithm on a variety of benchmark datasets including curated data synthetically corrupted with in-distribution and out-of-distribution noise, and two real world web noise datasets.

More collected data leads to more concerns about data privacy, including but not limited to pedestrian faces and surrounding vehicle license plates, which urges for robust solutions for detecting and anonymizing them in realistic road-driving scenarios. Existing public datasets for both face and license plate detection are either not focused on autonomous driving or only in parking lots. In this paper, we introduce a challenging public dataset for face and license plate detection in autonomous driving domain. The dataset is aggregated from visual data that is available in public domain, to cover scenarios from six European cities, including daytime and nighttime, annotated with both faces and license plates. All of the images feature a variety of poses and sizes for both faces and license plates. Our dataset offers not only a benchmark for evaluating data anonymization models but also data to get more insights about privacy-preserving autonomous driving. The experimental results showed that 1) current generic state-of-the-art face and/or license plate detection models do not perform well on a realistic and diverse road-driving dataset like ours, 2) our model trained with autonomous driving data (even with soft-labeling data) outperformed strong but generic models, and 3) the size of faces and license plates is an important factor for evaluating and optimizing the performance of privacy-preserving autonomous driving.

The tiny, fuzzy camouflaged objects result in visually indistinguishable properties. However, current single-view COD detectors are sensitive to background distractors. Therefore, blurred boundaries and variable shapes of the camouflaged objects are challenging to be fully captured with a single-view detector. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a behavior-inspired framework, called Multi-view Feature Fusion Network (MFFN), which mimics the human behaviors of finding indistinct objects in images, i.e., observing from multiple angles, distances, perspectives. Specifically, the key idea behind it is to generate multiple ways of observation (multi-view) by data augmentation and apply them as inputs. MFFN captures critical boundary and semantic information by comparing and fusing extracted multi-view features. In addition, our MFFN exploits the dependence and interaction between views and channels. Specifically, our methods leverage the complementary information between different views through a two-stage attention module called Co-attention of Multi-view (CAMV). And we design a local-overall module called Channel Fusion Unit (CFU) to explore the channel-wise contextual clues of diverse feature maps in an iterative manner. The experiment results show that our method performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art methods via training with the same data.

In this paper, we aim to accelerate MOT by transferring the knowledge from high-level features of a complex network (teacher) to a lightweight network (student) at both training and inference times. The proposed AttTrack framework has three key components: 1) cross-model feature learning to align intermediate representations from the teacher and student models, 2) interleaving the execution of the two models at inference time, and 3) incorporating the updated predictions from the teacher model as prior knowledge to assist the student model. Experiments on pedestrian tracking tasks are conducted on the MOT17 and MOT15 datasets using two different object detection backbones YOLOv5 and DLA34 show that AttTrack can significantly improve student model tracking performance while sacrificing only minor degradation of tracking speed."}

ML-Decoder predicts the existence of class labels via queries, and enables better utilization of spatial data compared to global average pooling.

Compared to using a larger backbone, ML-Decoder consistently provides a better speed-accuracy trade-off. ML-Decoder is also versatile - it can be used as a drop-in replacement for various classification heads, and generalize to unseen classes when operated with word queries. Novel query augmentations further improve its generalization ability. Using ML-Decoder, we achieve state-of-the-art results on several classification tasks: on MS-COCO multi-label, we reach 91.1% mAP; on NUS-WIDE zero-shot, we reach 31.1% ZSL mAP; and on ImageNet single-label, we reach with vanilla ResNet50 backbone a new top score of 80.7%, without extra data or distillation.

This paper focuses on texture images and considers how few normal samples are needed for accurate AD. We first highlight the critical nature of the problem that previous studies have overlooked: accurate detection gets harder for anisotropic textures when image orientations are not aligned between inputs and normal samples. We then propose a zero-shot method, which detects anomalies without using a normal sample. The method is free from the issue of unaligned orientation between input and normal images. It assumes the input texture to be homogeneous, detecting image regions that break the homogeneity as anomalies. We present a quantitative criterion to judge whether this assumption holds for an input texture. Experimental results show the broad applicability of the proposed zero-shot method and its good performance comparable to or even higher than the state-of-the-art methods using hundreds of normal samples.

Constructing a dataset with per-frame object region and consistent relationship annotations requires extremely high labor costs. Existing datasets sparsely annotate frames sampled from videos, resulting in the lack of dense spatio-temporal correlation in videos. Additionally, existing datasets contain inconsistent relationship annotations, leading to the problem of learning ambiguous temporal associations. Moreover, existing datasets mainly discuss relationships that can be inferred from a single frame, ignoring the significance of temporal associations. To resolve those issues, we created a simulated dataset with per-frame consistent annotations and introduced a range of relationships requiring both spatial and temporal context. Most existing methods explore spatial correlations within single images and do not explicitly consider the dynamic changes across frames. Therefore, we proposed a tracking-based approach that explicitly grasps spatio-temporal human-object interactions while simultaneously localizing humans and objects. Our proposed approach achieved state-of-the-art performance on scene graph generation and outperformed existing methods in scene graph localization by large margins on the proposed dataset. Moreover, the experiments show the efficacy of pre-training on the proposed dataset while adapting to a previous benchmark consisting of real daily videos, indicating the potential of the proposed dataset in real-world scenarios."}

However, for an ever-growing range of applications, interpreting a model's prediction remains non-trivial. Understanding decisions made by black-box algorithms is critical, and assessing their fairness and susceptibility to bias is a key step towards healthcare deployment. In this paper, we propose DBCE (Deformation Based Counterfactual Explainability). We optimise a diffeomorphic transformation that deforms a given input image to change the prediction of the model. This provides anatomically meaningful saliency maps indicating tissue atrophy and expansion, which can be easily interpreted by clinicians. In our test case, DBCE replicates the transition of a patient from healthy control (HC) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We benchmark DBCE against three commonly used saliency methods. We show that it provides more meaningful saliency maps when applied to one subject and disease-consistent atrophy patterns when used over a larger cohort.

We propose a new time-surface-like event stream representation method called Tencode. The event stream data processed by Tencode can obtain the pixel-level positioning of interest points while also simultaneously extracting descriptors through a neural network. Instead of using costly and unreliable manual annotation, our network leverages the prior knowledge of local feature extraction on color images and conducts self-supervised learning via homographic and spatio-temporal adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first research on event-based local features learning using a deep neural network. We provide comprehensive experiments of feature point detection and matching, and three public datasets are used for evaluation (i.e. DSEC, N-Caltech101, and HVGA ATIS Corner Dataset).

Many papers train one model for each scene respectively and few of them explore incorporating multi-modal data into this problem. In this paper, we focus on a rarely discussed but important setting: can we train one model that can represent multiple scenes, with 360deg insufficient views and RGB-D images? We refer insufficient views to few extremely sparse and almost non-overlapping views. To deal with it, X-NeRF, a fully explicit approach which learns a general scene completion process instead of a coordinate-based mapping, is proposed. Given a few insufficient RGB-D input views, X-NeRF first transforms them to a sparse point cloud tensor and then applies a 3D sparse generative Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to complete it to an explicit radiance field whose volumetric rendering can be conducted fast without running networks during inference. To avoid overfitting, besides common rendering loss, we apply perceptual loss as well as view augmentation through random rotation on point clouds.

However, DNNs are notoriously fragile to the class imbalance in image classification. We further point out that such imbalance fragility can be amplified when it comes to more sophisticated tasks such as pathology localization, as imbalances in such problems can have highly complex and often implicit forms of presence. For example, different pathology can have different sizes or colors (w.r.t.the background), different underlying demographic distributions, and in general different difficulty levels to recognize, even in a meticulously curated balanced distribution of training data. In this paper, we propose to use pruning to automatically and adaptively identify hard-to-learn (HTL) training samples, and improve pathology localization by attending them explicitly, during training in supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly-supervised settings. Our main inspiration is drawn from the recent finding that deep classification models have difficult-to-memorize samples and those may be effectively exposed through network pruning - and we extend such observation beyond classification for the first time. We also present interesting demographic analysis which illustrates HTLs ability to capture complex demographic imbalances. Our extensive experiments on the Skin Lesion Localization task in multiple training settings by paying additional attention to HTLs show significant improvement of localization performance by  2-3%."}

Here, the challenges related to underlying detection and re-identification tasks need to be addressed along with a joint optimization of these two tasks. In this paper, we propose a three-stage cascaded Scale-Augmented Transformer (SAT) person search framework. In the three-stage design of our SAT framework, the first stage performs person detection whereas the last two stages performs both detection and re-identification. Considering the contradictory nature of detection and identification, in the last two stages, we introduce separate norm feature embeddings for the two tasks to reconcile the relationship between them in a joint person search model. Our SAT framework benefits from the attributes of convolutional neural networks and transformers by introducing a convolutional encoder and a scale modulator within each stage. Here, the convolutional encoder increases the generalization ability of the model whereas the scale modulator performs context aggregation at different granularity levels to aid in handling pose/scale variations within a region of interest. To further improve the performance during occlusion, we apply shifting augmentation operations at each granularity level within the scale modulator.

Complementary images in the reference set can improve the generated headshot quality across many different views and poses. However, it is challenging to make the best use of multiple exemplars: the quality and alignment of each exemplar cannot be guaranteed. Using low-quality and mismatched images as references will impair the output results. To overcome these issues, we propose the efficient Headshot Image Super-Resolution with Multiple Exemplars network (HIME) method. Compared with previous methods, our network can effectively handle the misalignment between the input and the reference without requiring facial priors and learn the aggregated reference set representation in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, to reconstruct more detailed facial features, we propose a correlation loss that provides a rich representation of the local texture in a controllable spatial range. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only has significantly fewer computation cost than recent exemplar-guided methods but also achieves better qualitative and quantitative performance."}

A multi-task framework is favorable for sharing information across tasks under restricted computational resources. However, tasks not only share information but may also compete for resources and conflict with each other, making the optimization of shared parameters difficult and leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a simple but effective training scheme called GradSplit that alleviates this issue by utilizing asymmetric inter-task relations. Specifically, at each convolution module, it splits features into T groups for T tasks and trains each group only using the gradient back-propagated from the task losses with which it does not have conflicts. During training, we apply GradSplit to a series of convolution modules. As a result, each module is trained to generate a set of task-specific features using the shared features from the previous module. This enables a network to use complementary information across tasks while circumventing gradient conflicts. Experimental results show that GradSplit achieves a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than existing methods. It minimizes accuracy drop caused by task conflicts while significantly saving compute resources in terms of both FLOPs and memory at inference. We further show that GradSplit achieves higher cross-dataset accuracy compared to single-task and other multi-task networks."}

TransPillars aggregates spatial-temporal point cloud features from two perspectives. First, it fuses voxel-level features directly from multi-frame feature maps instead of pooled instance features to preserve instance details with contextual information that are essential to accurate object localization. Second, it introduces a hierarchical coarse-to-fine strategy to fuse multi-scale features progressively to effectively capture the motion of moving objects and guide the aggregation of fine features. Besides, a variant of deformable transformer is introduced to improve the effectiveness of cross-frame feature matching.

These variations are subtle, imperceptible to human eyes, and easily affected by noise. Existing deep learning-based rPPG estimators are incompetent due to three reasons. Firstly, they suppress the noise by utilizing information from the whole face even though different facial regions contain different noise characteristics. Secondly, local noise characteristics inherently affect the convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Lastly, the CNN sequential architectures fail to preserve long temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose RADIANT, that is, rPPG estimation using Signal Embeddings and Transformer. Our Transformer utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism that facilitates the feature subspace learning to extract the multiple correlations among the color variations corresponding to the periodic pulse. Also, its global information processing ability helps to suppress local noise characteristics. Apart from Transformer, we propose novel signal embedding to enhance the rPPG feature representation and suppress noise. We have also improved the generalization of our architecture by adding a new training set. To this end, the effectiveness of synthetic temporal signals and data augmentations were explored.

Finally, the queries are reshaped according the layout of grids in the BEV, and upsampled to produce the semantic segmentation result in a supervised manner. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on the public nuScenes dataset and a self-collected dataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance on BEV semantic segmentation from arbitrary camera rigs. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of each component via ablation study."}

However, endowing mobile agents with such a spatial sensing ability is still a challenge, due to two difficulties: (1) the previous convolutional models are limited by the local receptive field, thus, struggling to capture holistic long-range dependencies during observation; (2) the excessive computational budgets required for success, often lead to a separation of the mapping pipeline into stages, resulting the entire mapping process inefficient. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end one-stage Transformer-based framework for Mapping, termed Trans4Map. Our egocentric-to-allocentric mapping process includes three steps: (1) the efficient transformer extracts the contextual features from a batch of egocentric images; (2) the proposed Bidirectional Allocentric Memory (BAM) module projects egocentric features into the allocentric memory; (3) the map decoder parses the accumulated memory and predicts the top-down semantic segmentation map. In contrast, Trans4Map achieves state-of-the-art results, reducing 67.2% parameters, yet gaining a +3.25% mIoU and a +4.09% mBF1 improvements on the Matterport3D dataset."}

We have two major contributions: Adaptive Feature Fusion Attention (AFFA) and Interpreted Feature Similarity Regularization (IFSR). The AFFA module is embedded in the decoder and adaptively learns to fuse attribute features and features conditioned on identity information without requiring any additional facial segmentation process. In IFSR, we leverage the intermediate features in an identity encoder to preserve important attributes such as head pose, facial expression, lighting, and occlusion in the target face, while still transferring the identity of the source face with high fidelity. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on various datasets and show that the proposed FaceDancer outperforms other state-of-the-art networks in terms of identity transfer, while having significantly better pose preservation than most of the previous methods."}

Neither previous regression-based nor optimization-based frameworks could well balance between the facial reconstruction fidelity and efficiency. We notice that the large amount of in-the-wild facial images contain diverse appearance information, however, their underlying knowledge is not fully exploited for face modeling. To this end, we propose our Reconstruction by Encoding Facial Priors (ReEnFP) pipeline to exploit the potential of unconstrained facial images for further improvement. Our key is to encode generative priors learned by a style-based texture generator on unconstrained data for fast and detail-preserving face reconstruction. With our texture generator pre-trained using a differentiable renderer, faces could be encoded to its latent space as opposed to the time-consuming optimization-based inversion. Our generative prior encoding is further enhanced with a pyramid fusion block for adaptive integration of input spatial information. Extensive experiments show that our method reconstructs photo-realistic facial textures and geometric details with precise identity recovery."}

UDA adapts models trained on normal conditions to the target adverse-condition domains. Meanwhile, multiple datasets with driving scenes provide corresponding images of the same scenes across multiple conditions, which can serve as a form of weak supervision for domain adaptation. We propose Refign, a generic extension to self-training-based UDA methods which leverages these cross-domain correspondences. Refign consists of two steps: (1) aligning the normal-condition image to the corresponding adverse-condition image using an uncertainty-aware dense matching network, and (2) refining the adverse prediction with the normal prediction using an adaptive label correction mechanism. We design custom modules to streamline both steps and set the new state of the art for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on several adverse-condition benchmarks, including ACDC and Dark Zurich. The approach introduces no extra training parameters, minimal computational overhead--during training only--and can be used as a drop-in extension to improve any given self-training-based UDA method.

The reference images are usually retrieved via similarity search using global descriptor, and the local descriptors are used to re-rank the initial retrieved candidates. The local descriptors re-ranking can significantly improve the accuracy of global retrieval but comes at a high computational cost. To achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose an Efficient Transformer for Re-ranking (ETR), utilizing both global and local descriptors to re-rank the top candidates in a single shot. In contrast to traditional re-ranking methods, we leverage self-attention to capture relationships between local descriptors in a single image and cross-attention to explore the similarity of the image pairs. We show that the proposed model can be regarded as a general re-ranking algorithm for significantly boosting the performance of other global-only retrieval methods. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts and is orders of magnitude faster in terms of computational efficiency."}

However, there are times when unexpected and severe weather occurs in outdoor environments, making the detection tasks less effective and unexpected. In this case, additional sensors like lidar and radar are adopted to help the camera work in bad weather. However, existing multimodal detection methods do not consider the characteristics of different vehicle sensors to complement each other. Therefore, a novel end-to-end multimodal multistage object detection network called MT-DETR is proposed. Unlike the unimodal object detection networks, MT-DETR adds fusion modules and enhancement modules and adopts a hierarchical fusion mechanism. The Residual Fusion Module (RFM) and Confidence Fusion Module (CFM) are designed to fuse camera, lidar, radar, and time features. The Residual Enhancement Module (REM) reinforces each unimodal branch while a multistage loss is introduced to strengthen each branch's effectiveness. The synthesis algorithm for generating camera-lidar data pairs in foggy conditions further boosts the performance in unseen adverse weather. Extensive experiments on various weather conditions of the STF dataset demonstrate that MT-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The generality of MT-DETR has also been confirmed by replacing the feature extractor in the experiments. The code and pre-trained models are available on https://github.com/Chushihyun/MT-DETR."}

But the computational and memory requirements of these models prohibit their use in many applications, especially those that depend on high-resolution images, such as medical image classification. Efforts to train ViTs more efficiently are overly complicated, necessitating architectural changes or intricate training schemes. In this work, we show that standard ViT models can be efficiently trained at high resolution by randomly dropping input image patches. This simple approach, PatchDropout, reduces FLOPs and memory by at least 50% in standard natural image datasets such as ImageNet, and those savings only increase with image size. On CSAW, a high-resolution medical dataset, we observe a 5x savings in computation and memory using PatchDropout, along with a boost in performance. For practitioners with a fixed computational or memory budget, PatchDropout makes it possible to choose image resolution, hyperparameters, or model size to get the most performance out of their model."}

First, limited high-dimensional HSI training examples exacerbate the difficulty of deep learning methods in learning effective spatial and spectral representations. Second, the existing CNN-based methods model local relations and present limitations in capturing long-range dependencies. In this paper, we customize a novel dual-stream Transformer (DSTrans) for HSI restoration, which mainly consists of the dual-stream attention and the dual-stream feed-forward network. Specifically, we develop the dual-stream attention consisting of Multi-Dconv-head spectral attention (MDSA) and Multi-head Spatial self-attention (MSSA). MDSA and MSSA respectively calculate self-attention along the spectral and spatial dimensions in local windows to capture long-range spectrum dependencies and model global spatial interactions. Meanwhile, the dual-stream feed-forward network is developed to extract global signals and local details in parallel branches. In addition, we exploit a multi-tasking network to train the auxiliary RGB image (RGBI) task and HSI task jointly so that both numerous RGBI samples and limited HSI samples are exploited to learn parameter distribution for DSTrans. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on HSI restoration tasks, including HSI super-resolution and denoising.

When sampling correspondences to build the cost volume, a large neighborhood radius is required to deal with large displacements, introducing a significant computational burden. To address this, coarse-to-fine or recurrent processing of the cost volume is usually adopted, where correspondence sampling in a local neighborhood with a small radius suffices. In this paper, we propose an alternative by constructing cost volumes with different dilation factors to capture small and large displacements simultaneously. A U-Net with sikp connections is employed to convert the dilated cost volumes into interpolation weights between all possible captured displacements to get the optical flow. Our proposed model DCVNet only needs to process the cost volume once in a simple feedforward manner and does not rely on the sequential processing strategy. DCVNet obtains comparable accuracy to existing approaches and achieves real-time inference (30 fps on a mid-end 1080ti GPU)."}

Yet, these two axes are heterogeneous and challenging to fully explore. Existing works craft point operator under a single axis and reuse the crafted operator in all parts of 3D models. This overlooks the opportunity to better combine point interactions and dimensions by exploiting varying geometry/density of 3D point clouds. In this work, we establish PIDS, a novel paradigm to jointly explore point interactions and point dimensions to serve semantic segmentation on point cloud data. We establish a large search space to jointly consider versatile point interactions and point dimensions. This supports point operators with various geometry/density considerations. The enlarged search space with heterogeneous search components calls for a better ranking of candidate models. To achieve this, we improve the search space exploration by leveraging predictor-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS), and enhance the quality of prediction by assigning unique encoding to heterogeneous search components based on their priors. We thoroughly evaluate the networks crafted by PIDS on two semantic segmentation benchmarks, showing  1% mIOU improvement on SemanticKITTI and S3DIS over state-of-the-art 3D models."}

This dataset is created using cross-calibrated mmWave radar sensors and a monocular RGB camera for cross-modality training of radar-based human pose estimation. There are two advantages of using mmWave radar to perform human pose estimation. First, it is robust to dark and low-light conditions. Second, it is not visually perceivable by humans and therefore, can be widely applied to applications with privacy concerns, e.g., surveillance systems in patient rooms. In addition to the benchmark, we propose a cross-modality training framework that leverages the ground-truth 2D keypoints representing human body joints for training, which are systematically generated from the pre-trained 2D pose estimation network based on a monocular camera input image, avoiding laborious manual label annotation efforts. The framework consists of a new radar pre-processing method that better extracts the velocity information from radar data, Cross- and Self-Attention Module (CSAM), to fuse multi-scale radar features, and Pose Refinement Graph Convolutional Networks (PRGCN), to refine the predicted keypoint confidence heatmaps. Our intensive experiments on the HuPR benchmark show that the proposed scheme achieves better human pose estimation performance with only radar data, as compared to traditional pre-processing solutions and previous radio-frequency-based methods.

The primary challenge is how to precisely place the pixels from the reference image into the hole region. Therefore, understanding the 3D geometry that relates pixels between two views is a crucial step towards building a better model. Given the complexity of handling various types of reference images, we focus on the scenario where the images are captured by freely moving the same camera around. Compared to the previous work, we propose a principled approach that does not make heuristic assumptions about the planarity of the scene. We leverage a monocular depth estimate and predict relative pose between cameras, then align the reference image to the target by a differentiable 3D reprojection and a joint optimization of relative pose and depth map scale and offset. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both RealEstate10K and MannequinChallenge dataset with large baselines, complex geometry and extreme camera motions.

For each pixel in the reference image, our method leverages a deep architecture to search for the corresponding point in the source image directly along the corresponding epipolar line. We denote our method DELS-MVS: Deep Epipolar Line Search Multi-View Stereo. Previous works in deep MVS select a range of interest within the depth space, discretize it, and sample the epipolar line according to the resulting depth values: this can result in an uneven scanning of the epipolar line, hence of the image space. Instead, our method works directly on the epipolar line: this guarantees an even scanning of the image space and avoids both the need to select a depth range of interest, which is often not known a priori and can vary dramatically from scene to scene, and the need for a suitable discretization of the depth space. In fact, our search is iterative, which avoids the building of a cost volume, costly both to store and to process. Finally, our method performs a robust geometry-aware fusion of the estimated depth maps, leveraging a confidence predicted alongside each depth. We test DELS-MVS on the ETH3D, Tanks and Temples and DTU benchmarks and achieve competitive results with respect to state-of-the-art approaches."}

While the uplifting methods themselves are rather efficient, the true computational complexity depends on the per-frame 2D pose estimation. In this paper, we present a Transformer-based pose uplifting scheme that can operate on temporally sparse 2D pose sequences but still produce temporally dense 3D pose estimates. We show how masked token modeling can be utilized for temporal upsampling within Transformer blocks. This allows to decouple the sampling rate of input 2D poses and the target frame rate of the video and drastically decreases the total computational complexity. Additionally, we explore the option of pre-training on large motion capture archives, which has been largely neglected so far. We evaluate our method on two popular benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.

Existing learning-based methods majorly work for specific garment type (e.g. t-shirt, skirt, etc) or garment topology, and needs retraining for a new type of garment. Similarly, some methods focus on a particular fabric, body shape, and pose. To circumvent these limitations, our method fundamentally learns the physical dynamics of the garment vertices conditioned on underlying body shape, motion, and fabric properties to generalize across garment types, topology, and fabric along with different body shape and pose. In particular, we represent the garment as a graph, where the nodes represent the physical state of the garment vertices, and the edges represent the relation between the two nodes. The nodes and edges of the garment graph encode various properties of garments and the human body to compute the dynamics of the vertices through a learned message-passing. Learning of such dynamics of the garment vertices conditioned on underlying body motion and fabric properties enables our method to be trained simultaneously for multiple types of garments (e.g., tops, skirts, etc) with arbitrary mesh resolutions, varying topologies, and fabric properties. Our experimental results show that GarSim with less amount of training data not only outperforms the SOTA methods on challenging CLOTH3D dataset both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also works reliably well on the unseen poses obtained from YouTube videos, and give satisfactory results on unseen cloth types which were not present during the training."}

Currently, this is formulated as an automatic disease segmentation task addressed via deep learning frameworks. These deep leaning frameworks trained with leaf image data in a supervised paradigm have few limitations, mainly: (1) training datasets are heavily imbalanced towards healthy leaf images, (2) disease region annotation is labour-intensive and (3) due to the heterogeneity of disease symptoms, these frameworks lacks generalisability. In this paper, we reformulate disease segmentation as an anomaly localisation task. Specifically, we introduce a novel unsupervised framework (AnoLeaf) based on an edge-guided inpainting that optimises the learning of contextual attention on only healthy leaf images. The network utilisation on diseased leaf images results in reconstruction of its healthy counterparts, generating an inpainting error. The contextual attention maps reinforce the inpainting error to effectively localise the disease. Thus, AnoLeaf alleviates the acquisition and annotation of rare disease images.

To address these limitations, we propose an unguided approach based on UNet that is invariant to sparsity of inputs. Boundary consistency in reconstruction is explicitly enforced through auxiliary learning on a synthetic dataset with dense depth and depth contour images as targets, followed by fine-tuning on a real-world dataset. With our network architecture and simple implementation approach, we achieve competitive results among unguided approaches on KITTI benchmark and show that the reconstructed image has sharp boundaries and is robust even towards extremely sparse LiDAR measurements."}

Many works were dedicated to this topic, but randomized smoothing has been recently proven to be an effective approach for the certified defense of deep neural networks and getting robust classifiers. Some prior results were obtained utilizing the techniques of adding extra parameters to extend the limits of the certification regions. In this way, sample-wise optimization was proposed to maximize the certification radius per input. The idea was further extended with the generalized anisotropic counterparts of l1 and l2 certificates which allow achieving larger certified region volume avoiding worst-case certification near potentially larger safe regions. However, anisotropic certification is limited by the aligned axis lacking the freedom to extend in any direction. To mitigate this constraint, in this work, we (i) revisit the anisotropic certification, provide an analysis of its non-axis aligned counterpart and propose its rotation-free extension, (ii) conduct experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset to report the improved performance."}

In addition to achieving reliable accuracy, a critical subtask for these models is to detect Out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Given the nature of the deployment environment, one may expect such OOD inputs to also be fine-grained w.r.t. the known classes (e.g., a novel bird species), which are thus extremely difficult to identify. Unfortunately, OOD detection in fine-grained scenarios remains largely underexplored. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by first carefully constructing four large-scale fine-grained test environments, in which existing methods are shown to have difficulties. Particularly, we find that even explicitly incorporating a diverse set of auxiliary outlier data during training does not provide sufficient coverage over the broad region where fine-grained OOD samples locate. We then propose Mixture Outlier Exposure (MixOE), which mixes ID data and training outliers to expand the coverage of different OOD granularities, and trains the model such that the prediction confidence linearly decays as the input transitions from ID to OOD. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of MixOE for building up OOD detector in fine-grained environments. The code is available at https://github.com/zjysteven/MixOE."}

Along with tackling these challenges, an efficient VPR technique must also be practical in real-world scenarios where latency matters. To address this, we introduce MixVPR, a new holistic feature aggregation technique that takes feature maps from pre-trained backbones as a set of global features. Then, it incorporates a global relationship between elements in each feature map in a cascade of feature mixing, eliminating the need for local or pyramidal aggregation as done in NetVLAD or TransVPR. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through extensive experiments on multiple large-scale benchmarks.

Rather than using pointwise flow vectors, our approach represents scene flow as the composition a global ego-motion and a set of bounding boxes with their own rigid motions, exploiting the multi-body rigidity commonly present in dynamic scenes. We jointly optimize these parameters over a novel loss function based on the nearest neighbor distance using a differentiable bounding box formulation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on KITTI Scene Flow and nuScenes without requiring any annotations, outperforming even supervised methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on motion segmentation and ego-motion estimation. Lastly, we visualize our predictions and validate our loss function design with an ablation study."}

Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from three key problems: negative transfer, lack of discriminability, and domain invariance in the latent space. To alleviate the above issues, we develop a novel 'Select, Label, and Mix' (SLM) framework that aims to learn discriminative invariant feature representations for partial domain adaptation. First, we present an efficient \"select\" module that automatically filters out the outlier source samples to avoid negative transfer while aligning distributions across both domains. Second, the \"label\" module iteratively trains the classifier using both the labeled source domain data and the generated pseudo-labels for the target domain to enhance the discriminability of the latent space. Finally, the \"mix\" module utilizes domain mixup regularization jointly with the other two modules to explore more intrinsic structures across domains leading to a domain-invariant latent space for partial domain adaptation. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over state-of-the-art methods. Project page: https://cvir.github.io/projects/slm."}

Graph Convolutional networks (GCNs) allow for the preservation of the topologies of hands poses and shapes by modeling them as a graph. In this work, we propose the THOR-Net which combines the power of GCNs, Transformer, and self-supervision to realistically reconstruct two hands and an object from a single RGB image. Our network comprises two stages; namely the features extraction stage and the reconstruction stage. In the features extraction stage, a Keypoint RCNN is used to extract 2D poses, features maps, heatmaps, and bounding boxes from a monocular RGB image. Thereafter, this 2D information is modeled as two graphs and passed to the two branches of the reconstruction stage. The shape reconstruction branch estimates meshes of two hands and an object using our novel coarse-to-fine GraFormer shape network. The 3D poses of the hands and objects are reconstructed by the other branch using a GraFormer network. Finally, a self-supervised photometric loss is used to directly regress the realistic textured of each vertex in the hands' meshes. Our approach achieves State-of-the-art results in Hand shape estimation on the HO3D dataset (10.0mm) exceeding ArtiBoost (10.8mm). It also surpasses other methods in hand pose estimation on the challenging two hands and object (H2O) dataset by 5mm on the left-hand pose and 1 mm on the right-hand pose.

To achieve the desired efficiency-effectiveness trade-off, we then leverage an input information compression on its frequency domain representation, which highlights the visually significant signals inspired by JPEG compression. We explore different frequency domain down-sampling strategies and show that it is possible to preserve the semantic meaningful information by strategically dropping the high-frequency components. The proposed DCFormer is tested on various downstream tasks including image classification, object detection and instance segmentation, and achieves state-of-the-art comparable performance with less FLOPs, and outperforms the commonly used backbone (e.g. SWIN) at similar FLOPs.

These CNN models are computationally expensive and diminish the quality of receptive fields for tasks like micro-expression recognition (MER) with limited training samples. Therefore, we proposed a refined neural architecture search strategy to search a tiny CNN architecture for MER. In addition, we introduced a refined hybrid module (RHM) for innerlevel search space and an optimal path explore network (OPEN) for outer-level search. The RHM focuses on discovering optimal cell structures by incorporating a multilateral hybrid spatiotemporal operation space. Also, spatiotemporal attention blocks are embedded to refine the aggregated cell features. The OPEN search space aims to trace an optimal path between the cells to generate a tiny spatiotemporal CNN architecture instead of covering all possible tracks. The aggregate mix of RHM and OPEN search space availed the NAS method to robustly search and design an effective and efficient framework for MER. Compared with contemporary works, experiments reveal that the RNAS-MER is capable of bridging the gap between NAS algorithms and MER tasks.

However, they inevitably suffer from the limitation in modeling long-range dependencies and spatial correlations due to the nature of convolution operation. Although Transformers were first developed to address this issue, they fail to capture low-level features. In contrast, it is demonstrated that both local and global features are crucial for dense prediction, such as segmenting in challenging contexts. In this paper, we propose HiFormer, a novel method that efficiently bridges a Convolutional neural network and a Transformer for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we design two multi-scale feature representations using the seminal Swin-Transformer module and a CNN-based encoder. To secure a fine fusion of global and local features obtained from the two aforementioned representations, we propose a Double-Level Fusion (DLF) module in the skip connection of the encoder-decoder outline.

Prior research on generative FSOSR cannot handle such a situation due to their inability to approximate the open space prudently. To address this issue, we propose a method, Meta-learning-based Open-set Recognition via Generative Adversarial Network (MORGAN), that can learn a finer separation between the closed and the open spaces. MORGAN seeks to generate class-conditioned adversarial samples for both the closed and open spaces in the few-shot regime using two GANs by judiciously tuning noise variance while ensuring discriminability using a novel Anti-Overlap Latent (AOL) regularizer. Adversarial samples from low noise variance amplify known class data density, and we use samples from high noise variance to augment known-unknowns. A first-order episodic strategy is adapted to ensure stability in the GAN training. Finally, we introduce a combination of metric losses which push these augmented known-unknowns or outliers to disperse in the open space while condensing known class distributions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets indicate that MORGAN achieves state-of-the-art FSOSR performance consistently."}

However, while the self-attention models fail to incorporate the global context due to the limited size of the receptive fields, cross-attention learning may generate ambiguous features as the feature extractors for all the modalities are jointly trained. This results in the generation of redundant multi-modal features, thus limiting the fusion performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel fusion architecture called Global Attention based Fusion Network (GAF-Net), equipped with novel self and cross-attention learning techniques. We introduce the within-modality feature refinement module through global spectral-spatial attention learning using the query-key-value processing where both the global spatial and channel contexts are used to generate two channel attention masks. Since it is non-trivial to generate the cross-attention from within the fusion network, we propose to leverage two auxiliary tasks of modality-specific classification to produce highly discriminative cross-attention masks. Finally, to ensure non-redundancy, we propose to penalize the high correlation between attended modality-specific features. Our extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, including optical, multispectral (MS), hyperspectral (HSI), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and audio modalities establish the superiority of GAF-Net concerning the literature."}

Surgical tools are similar in appearance and are long, thin, and handled at an angle. The fine-tuning of state-of-the-art (SOTA) instance segmentation models trained on natural images for instrument segmentation has difficulty discriminating instrument classes. Our research demonstrates that while the bounding box and segmentation mask are often accurate, the classification head misclassifies the class label of the surgical instrument. We present a new neural network framework that adds a classification module as a new stage to existing instance segmentation models. This module specializes in improving the classification of instrument masks generated by the existing model. The module comprises multi-scale mask attention, which attends to the instrument region and masks the distracting background features. We propose training the proposed classifier module using metric learning with arc loss to handle low inter-class variance of surgical instruments. We conduct exhaustive experiments on the benchmark datasets EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018.

Previous work is mainly built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn domain-invariant representations. With the recent exponential increase in applying Vision Transformer (ViT) to vision tasks, the capability of ViT in adapting cross-domain knowledge, however, remains unexplored in the literature. To fill this gap, this paper first comprehensively investigates the performance of ViT on a variety of domain adaptation tasks. Surprisingly, ViT demonstrates superior generalization ability, while the performance can be further improved by incorporating adversarial adaptation. Notwithstanding, directly using CNNs-based adaptation strategies fails to take the advantage of ViT's intrinsic merits (e.g., attention mechanism and sequential image representation) which play an important role in knowledge transfer. To remedy this, we propose an unified framework, namely Transferable Vision Transformer (TVT), to fully exploit the transferability of ViT for domain adaptation. Specifically, we delicately devise a novel and effective unit, which we term Transferability Adaption Module (TAM). By injecting learned transferabilities into attention blocks, TAM compels ViT focus on both transferable and discriminative features. Besides, we leverage discriminative clustering to enhance feature diversity and separation which are undermined during adversarial domain alignment. To verify its versatility, we perform extensive studies of TVT on four benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that TVT attains significant improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art UDA methods."}

Essential to our framework is the realization that the accuracy, rather than the density, of pixel flows is what is required for high-quality video enhancement. Most of prior works take the opposite approach: they estimate dense (per-pixel)--but generally less robust--flows, mostly using computationally costly algorithms. Instead, we propose a lightweight flow estimation algorithm; it fuses the sparse point cloud data and (even sparser and less reliable) IMU data available in modern autonomous agents to estimate the flow information. Building on top of the flow estimation, we demonstrate a general framework that integrates the flows in a plug-and-play fashion with different task-specific layers. Algorithms built in our framework achieve 1.78x -- 187.41x speedup while providing a 0.42dB - 6.70 dB quality improvement over competing methods."}

In addition, we demonstrate the strengths of SGPCR-based point cloud representation using the fundamental challenge of shape retrieval and point cloud registration on point clouds with zero point-to-point correspondences. Under these conditions, our approach improves registration quality by reducing chamfer distance by up to 90% and rotation root mean square error by up to 86% compared to the state of the art.

However, the core challenge of this task still is the enormous shape variation within each category. With regard to the challenge, we propose a novel framework SD-Pose, which utilizes the instance-category structural discrepancy and the potential geometric-semantic association to enhance the exploration of the intra-class shape information. Specifically, an information exchange augmentation (IEA) module is introduced to supplement the instance-category structural information by their structural discrepancy, thus facilitating the enhanced geometric information to contain both the character of instance shape and the commonality of category structure. For complementing the deficiencies of structural information adaptively, a semantic dynamic fusion (SDF) module is further designed to fuse semantic and geometric features. Finally, the proposed SD-Pose framework equipped with the IEA and SDF modules hierarchically supplements instance-category structural information in a stacked manner and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMERA25 and REAL275 datasets."}

These layers require additional parameters and are hyperparameter sensitive. They significantly increase training time, memory cost, and potential latency which can be costly for resource-limited or real-time applications. In this paper, we present a fast learnable once-for-all adversarial training (FLOAT) algorithm, which instead of the existing FiLM-based conditioning, presents a unique weight conditioned learning that requires no additional layer, thereby incurring no significant increase in parameter count, training time, or network latency compared to standard adversarial training. In particular, we add configurable scaled noise to the weight tensors that enables a trade-off between clean and adversarial performance. Extensive experiments show that FLOAT can yield SOTA performance improving both clean and perturbed image classification by up to  6% and  10%, respectively. Moreover, real hardware measurement shows that FLOAT can reduce the training time by up to 1.43x with fewer model parameters of up to 1.47x on iso-hyperparameter settings compared to the FiLM-based alternatives.

Previous methods like pSp have shown promising results by leveraging StyleGAN as a generator in various I2I tasks but they seem to miss finer or under-represented details in facial images like earrings and caps, and break down on complex datasets due to their solely global approach. To address these shortcomings, we propose a technique termed Spatial Layout Injection (SLI-pSp) that encodes spatial layout information in the input image in the StyleGAN generator along with style. We do so without modifying the style vector injection in the generator through pSp's map2style network, but rather by combining SLI with noise layers in the StyleGAN generator at multiple spatial scales. Such an approach helps preserve global aspects of image generation as well as enhance spatial layout details in the output. We experiment on several challenging datasets and across several I2I tasks that highlight the effectiveness of our approach over previous methods with respect to finer details in the generated image and overall visual quality."}

Unlike object-centered image clustering, anomaly clustering is particularly challenging as anomalous patterns are subtle and local. We present a simple yet effective clustering framework using a patch-based pretrained deep embeddings and off-the-shelf clustering methods. We define a distance function between images, each of which is represented as a bag of embeddings, by the Euclidean distance between weighted averaged embeddings. The weight defines the importance of instances (i.e., patch embeddings) in the bag, which may highlight defective regions.

In the many-to-many setting, an additional guidance example from the target domain is used to determine the domain-specific factors of variation of the generated image. In the absence of attribute annotations, methods have to infer which factors of variation are specific to each domain from data during training. In this paper, we show that many state-of-the-art architectures implicitly treat textures and colors as always being domain-specific, and thus fail when they are not. We propose a new method called RIFT that does not rely on such inductive architectural biases and instead infers which attributes are domain-specific vs shared directly from data. As a result, RIFT achieves consistently high cross-domain manipulation accuracy across multiple datasets spanning a wide variety of domain-specific and shared factors of variation."}

Although many mixup variants and distillation methods have been proposed, much remains to be understood regarding the role of a mixup in knowledge distillation. In this paper, we present a detailed empirical study on various important dimensions of compatibility between mixup and knowledge distillation. We also scrutinize the behavior of the networks trained with a mixup in the light of knowledge distillation through extensive analysis, visualizations, and comprehensive experiments on image classification.

Our experiments show that the performance of recent training-free metrics drops dramatically when the #Param information is not available. Motivated by these observations, we argue that metrics less correlated with the #Param are desired to provide additional information for NAS. We propose a light-weight training-based metric which has a weak correlation with the #Param while achieving better performance than training-free metrics at a lower search cost.

However, in applications with constrained resources, an agent may not be able to observe the complete frame, yet must still locate useful glimpses to predict an incomplete action based on local information only. In this paper, we develop Glimpse Transformers (GliTr), which observe only narrow glimpses at all times, thus predicting an ongoing action and the following most informative glimpse location based on the partial spatiotemporal information collected so far. In the absence of a ground truth for the optimal glimpse locations for action recognition, we train GliTr using a novel spatiotemporal consistency objective: We require GliTr to attend to the glimpses with features similar to the corresponding complete frames (i.e. spatial consistency) and the resultant class logits at time t equivalent to the ones predicted using whole frames up to t (i.e. temporal consistency). Inclusion of our proposed consistency objective yields  10% higher accuracy on the Something-Something-v2 (SSv2) dataset than the baseline cross-entropy objective.

Despite its popularity and universality, such a straightforward paradigm is sensitive to slight numerical deviations, especially in localization. By exploiting the property that point clouds are naturally captured on the surface of objects along with accurate location and intensity information, we introduce a new perspective that views bounding box regression as an implicit function. This leads to our proposed framework, termed Implicit Detection or ImpDet, which leverages implicit field learning for 3D object detection. Our ImpDet assigns specific values to points in different local 3D spaces, thereby high-quality boundaries can be generated by classifying points inside or outside the boundary. To solve the problem of sparsity on the object surface, we further present a simple yet efficient virtual sampling strategy to not only fill the empty region, but also learn rich semantic features to help refine the boundaries. Extensive experimental results on KITTI and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of unifying implicit fields into object detection."}

By contrast, photoplethysmography (PPG) provides easy-to-collect data, but its limited accuracy constrains its clinical usage. To combine the advantages of both signals, recent studies incorporate various deep learning techniques for the reconstruction of PPG signals to ECG; however, the lack of contextual information as well as the limited abilities to denoise biomedical signals ultimately constrain model performance. In this research, we propose Performer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that reconstructs ECG from PPG and combines the PPG and reconstructed ECG as multiple modalities for CVD detection. This method is the first time that Transformer sequence-to-sequence translation has been performed on biomedical waveform reconstruction, combining the advantages of both PPG and ECG. We also create Shifted Patch-based Attention (SPA), an effective method to encode/decode the biomedical waveforms. Through fetching the various sequence lengths and capturing cross-patch connections, SPA maximizes the signal processing for both local features and global contextual representations. The proposed architecture generates a state-of-the-art performance of 0.29 RMSE for the reconstruction of PPG to ECG on the BIDMC database, surpassing prior studies. We also evaluated this model on the MIMIC-III dataset, achieving a 95.9% accuracy in CVD detection, and on the PPG-BP dataset, achieving 75.9% accuracy in related CVD diabetes detection, indicating its generalizability. As a proof of concept, an earring wearable named PEARL (prototype), was designed to scale up the point-of-care (POC) healthcare system."}

In particular, StyleGAN2 has enabled various image generation and manipulation tasks due to its rich and disentangled latent spaces. However, the discovery of such directions is typically made either in a supervised manner, which requires annotated data for each desired manipulation, or in an unsupervised manner, which requires a manual effort to identify the directions. As a result, existing work typically finds only a handful of directions in which controllable edits can be made. In this study, we design a novel submodular framework that finds the most representative and diverse subset of directions in the latent space of StyleGAN2. Our approach takes advantage of the latent space of channel-wise style parameters, so-called stylespace, in which we cluster channels that perform similar manipulations into groups. Our framework promotes diversity by using the notion of clusters and can be efficiently solved with a greedy optimization scheme. We evaluate our framework with qualitative and quantitative experiments and show that our method finds more diverse and disentangled directions."}

Inspired by the compositional representation of objects in humans, we train a neural network architecture that explicitly represents objects as a dictionary of shared components and their spatial composition. In particular, during meta-learning, we train a knowledge base that consists of a dictionary of component representations and a dictionary of component activation maps that encode common spatial activation patterns of components. The elements of both dictionaries are shared among the training classes. During meta-testing, the representation of unseen classes is learned using the component representations and the component activation maps from the knowledge base. Finally, an attention mechanism is used to strengthen those components that are most important for each category. We demonstrate the value of our compositional learning framework for a few-shot classification using miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and FC100, where we achieve comparable performance."}

SRMs that predict residuals remedy this up to a degree, but fall short of providing an accurate and flexible solution. In this paper, we rethink residual predictions and propose Learnable Residual Attention (LRA) and Learnable Dense Reconstruction Attention (LDRA) modules, which operate over the input and the output of SRMs. These modules guide an SRM to concentrate on shadow region reconstruction, and limit reconstruction of non-shadow regions. The modules improve shadow removal (up to 20%) and detection accuracy across various backbones, and even improve the accuracy of other removal methods (up to 10%). In addition, the modules have minimal overhead (+<1MB memory) and are implemented in a few lines of code. Furthermore, to combat the challenge of training SRMs with small datasets, we present a synthetic dataset generation pipeline. Using our pipeline, we create a dataset called PITSA, which has 10 times more unique shadow-free images than the largest benchmark dataset. Pre-training models on the PITSA significantly improves shadow removal (+2 MAE on shadow regions) and detection accuracy of multiple methods. Our results show that LRA&LDRA, when plugged into a lightweight architecture pre-trained on the PITSA, outperform state-of-the-art shadow removal (+0.7 all-region MAE) and detection (+0.1 BER) methods on the benchmark ISTD and SRD datasets, despite running faster (+5%) and consuming less memory (x150)."}

This paper introduces an efficient TransVLAD module, which aggregates attention-based feature maps into a discriminative and compact global descriptor. Unlike existing methods that generate feature maps using only convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we propose a sparse transformer to encode global dependencies and compute attention-based feature maps, which effectively reduces visual ambiguities that occurs in large-scale geo-localization problems. A positional embedding mechanism is used to learn the corresponding geometric configurations between query and gallery images. A grouped VLAD layer is also introduced to reduce the number of parameters, and thus construct an efficient module. Finally, rather than only learning from the global descriptors on entire images, we propose a self-supervised learning method to further encode more information from multi-scale patches between the query and positive gallery images. Extensive experiments on three challenging large-scale datasets indicate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models, and has lower computational complexity."}

It is challenging because hierarchically structured side information is distorted when features are embedded in the Euclidean space in existing literature, which incurs the difficulty of identifying the unseen samples. In this paper, we introduce a side information learning algorithm for generalized open set recognition based on the hyperbolic space to alleviate the distortion and accurately identify the unknown samples. Specifically, we propose a hyperbolic side information learning framework to identify the unseen samples and an ancestor search algorithm to search the most similar ancestor from the taxonomy of selected known classes. Experiments on CUB-200 and AWA 2 datasets show that our method improves the performance of generalized open set recognition by a large margin."}

Estimating the global motion between successive frames, in a manner not influenced by moving objects, is central to many video stabilization techniques, but poses significant challenges. A large body of work uses 2D affine transformations or homography for the global motion. However, in this work, we introduce a more general representation scheme, which adapts any existing optical flow network to ignore the moving objects and obtain a spatially smooth approximation of the global motion between video frames. We achieve this by a knowledge distillation approach, where we first introduce a low pass filter module into the optical flow network to constrain the predicted optical flow to be spatially smooth. This becomes our student network, named as GLOBALFLOWNET. Then, using the original optical flow network as the teacher network, we train the student network using a robust loss function. Given a trained GLOBALFLOWNET, we stabilize videos using a two stage process. In the first stage, we correct the instability in affine parameters using a quadratic programming approach constrained by a user-specified cropping limit to control loss of field of view. In the second stage, we stabilize the video further by smoothing global motion parameters, expressed using small number of discrete cosine transform coefficients. In extensive experiments on a variety of different videos, our technique outperforms state of the art techniques in terms of subjective quality and different quantitative measures of video stability. Additionally, we present a new measure for evaluation of video stabilization based on the flow generated by GLOBALFLOWNET and argue that it is based on a more general motion model in contrast to the affine motion model on which most existing measures are based.

Different from traditional approaches, we propose ConfMix, the first method that introduces a sample mixing strategy based on region-level detection confidence for adaptive object detector learning. We mix the local region of the target sample that corresponds to the most confident pseudo detections with a source image, and apply an additional consistency loss term to gradually adapt towards the target data distribution. In order to robustly define a confidence score for a region, we exploit the confidence score per pseudo detection that accounts for both the detector-dependent confidence and the bounding box uncertainty. Moreover, we propose a novel pseudo labelling scheme that progressively filters the pseudo target detections using the confidence metric that varies from a loose to strict manner along the training. We perform extensive experiments with three datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in two of them and approaching the supervised target model performance in the other.

Existing reconstruction frameworks use convolution-based segmentation networks to partition the neuron from noisy backgrounds before applying the tracing algorithm. The tracing results are sensitive to the raw image quality and segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for 3D neuron reconstruction. Our key idea is to use the geometric representation power of the point cloud to better explore the intrinsic structural information of neurons. Our proposed framework adopts one graph convolutional network to predict the neural skeleton points and another one to produce the connectivity of these points. We finally generate the target SWC file through the interpretation of the predicted point coordinates, radius, and connections. Evaluated on the Janelia-Fly dataset from the BigNeuron project, we show that our framework achieves competitive neuron reconstruction performance. Our geometry and topology learning of point clouds could further benefit 3D medical image analysis, such as cardiac surface reconstruction.

Recent research addressing this issue focuses on optimisation of an explicit voxel grid (EVG) that represents the scene, which can be paired with neural networks to learn radiance fields.

However, in reality, tourists visit various places worldwide and document their trips primarily through photos. These images contain a wealth of raw information that can be used to capture users' preferences and recommend personalized content. Visual content was already used in past works, but no large-scale publicly-available dataset that gives access to users' personal images exists for recommender systems. As such a resource would open-up possibilities for new image-based recommendation algorithms, we introduce Vis2Rec, a new dataset based on visit data extracted from users' Flickr photographic streams, which includes over 7 million photos, 36k recognizable points of interest, and 14k user profiles. Google Landmarks v2 is used as an auxiliary dataset to identify points of interest in users' photos, using a state-of-the-art image-matching deep architecture. Image-based user profiles are then constituted by aggregating the points of interest detected for each user. In addition, ground truth visits were determined for the test subset in order to enable accurate evaluation. Finally, we benchmark Vis2Rec using various existing recommender systems, and discuss the possibilities opened up by the availability of user images, as well as the societal issues that come with them. Following good practice in dataset sharing, Vis2Rec is created using only freely distributable content, and additional anonymization is performed to ensure the privacy of users. The raw dataset and the preprocessed user profiles will be publicly available at https://github.com/MSoumm/Vis2Rec."}

However, in contrast to conventional shape representations such as polygon meshes, the implicit representations cannot be easily edited and existing works that attempt to address this problem are extremely limited. In this work, we propose the first method for efficient interactive editing of signed distance functions expressed through neural networks, allowing free-form editing. Inspired by 3D sculpting software for meshes, we use a brush-based framework that is intuitive and can in the future be used by sculptors and digital artists. In order to localize the desired surface deformations, we regulate the network by using a copy of it to sample the previously expressed surface. We introduce a novel framework for simulating sculpting-style surface edits, in conjunction with interactive surface sampling and efficient adaptation of network weights. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate our method in various different 3D objects and under many different edits. The reported results clearly show that our method yields high accuracy, in terms of achieving the desired edits, while in the same time preserving the geometry outside the interaction areas."}

We claim that the performance of inpainting algorithms can be better judged by the generated structures and textures. Structures refer to the generated object boundary or novel geometric structures within the hole, while texture refers to high-frequency details, especially man-made repeating patterns filled inside the structural regions. We believe that better structures are usually obtained from a coarse-to-fine GAN-based generator network while repeating patterns nowadays can be better modeled using state-of-the-art high-frequency fast fourier convolutional layers. In this paper, we propose a novel inpainting network combining the advantages of the two designs. Therefore, our model achieves a remarkable visual quality to match state-of-the-art performance in both structure generation and repeating texture synthesis using a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, and our conclusions further highlight the two critical factors of image inpainting quality, structures, and textures, as the future design directions of inpainting networks."}

In open set problems, test samples may be drawn from either known or unknown classes. Existing open set action recognition methods are typically based on extending closed set methods by adding post hoc analysis of classification scores or feature distances and do not capture the relations among all the video clip elements. Our approach uses the reconstruction error to determine the novelty of the video since unknown classes are harder to put back together and thus have a higher reconstruction error than videos from known classes. We refer to our solution to the open set action recognition problem as \"Humpty Dumpty\", due to its reconstruction abilities. Humpty Dumpty is a novel graph-based autoencoder that accounts for contextual and semantic relations among the clip pieces for improved reconstruction. A larger reconstruction error leads to an increased likelihood that the action can not be reconstructed, i.e., can not put Humpty Dumpty back together again, indicating that the action has never been seen before and is novel/unknown. Extensive experiments are performed on two publicly available action recognition datasets including HMDB-51 and UCF-101, showing the state-of-the-art performance for open set action recognition."}

For both, the convolutional as well as the recent attention-based models, encoder-decoder-based architectures have been found to be useful due to the simultaneous requirement of global context and pixel-level resolution. Typically, a skip connection module is used to fuse the encoder and decoder features, which comprises of feature map concatenation followed by a convolution operation. Inspired by the demonstrated benefits of attention in a multitude of computer vision problems, we propose an attention-based fusion of encoder and decoder features. We pose MDE as a pixel query refinement problem, where coarsest-level encoder features are used to initialize pixel-level queries, which are then refined to higher resolutions by the proposed Skip Attention Module (SAM). We formulate the prediction problem as ordinal regression over the bin centers that discretize the continuous depth range and introduce a Bin Center Predictor (BCP) module that predicts bins at the coarsest level using pixel queries. Apart from the benefit of image adaptive depth binning, the proposed design helps learn improved depth embedding in initial pixel queries via direct supervision from the ground truth.

Despite of the progress, due to the limited fields of view of regular images, reconstructing large indoor environments still requires collecting many images with sufficient visual overlap, which is quite labor-intensive. 360deg images cover a much larger field of view than regular images and would facilitate the capture process. In this paper, we present 360MVSNet, the first deep learning network for multi-view stereo with 360deg images. Our method combines uncertainty estimation with a spherical sweeping module for 360deg images captured from multiple viewpoints in order to construct multi-scale cost volumes. By regressing volumes in a coarse-to-fine manner, high-resolution depth maps can be obtained. Furthermore, we have constructed EQMVS, a large-scale synthetic dataset that consists of over 50K pairs of RGB and depth maps in equirectangular projection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reconstruct large synthetic and real-world indoor scenes with significantly better completeness than previous traditional and learning-based methods while saving both time and effort in the data acquisition process."}

Weighted loss is one of the most popular ways of mitigating this issue, and a recent work has suggested that class-difficulty might be a better clue than conventionally used class-frequency to decide the distribution of weights. A heuristic formulation was used in the previous work for quantifying the difficulty, but we empirically find that the optimal formulation varies depending on the characteristics of datasets. Therefore, we propose Difficulty-Net, which learns to predict the difficulty of classes using the model's performance in a meta-learning framework. To make it learn reasonable difficulty of a class within the context of other classes, we newly introduce two key concepts, namely the relative difficulty and the driver loss. The former helps Difficulty-Net take other classes into account when calculating difficulty of a class, while the latter is indispensable for guiding the learning to a meaningful direction. Extensive experiments on popular long-tailed datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-tailed datasets.

Further, the task assumes that the source data is not available for adaptation, due to privacy concerns or otherwise. We postulate that such systems need to jointly optimize the dual task of (i) selecting fixed number of samples from the target domain for annotation and (ii) transfer of knowledge from the pre-trained network to the target domain. To do this, SALAD consists of a novel Guided Attention Transfer Network (GATN) and an active learning function, HAL. The GATN enables feature distillation from pre-trained network to the target network, complemented with the target samples mined by HAL using transfer-ability and uncertainty criteria. SALAD has three key benefits: (i) it is task-agnostic, and can be applied across various visual tasks such as classification, segmentation and detection; (ii) it can handle shifts in output label space from the pre-trained source network to the target domain; (iii) it does not require access to source data for adaptation. We conduct extensive experiments across 3 visual tasks, viz. digits classification (MNIST, SVHN, VISDA), synthetic (GTA5) to real (CityScapes) image segmentation, and document layout detection (PubLayNet to DSSE). We show that our source-free approach, SALAD, results in an improvement of 0.5%-31.3% (across datasets and tasks) over prior adaptation methods that assume access to large amounts of annotated source data for adaptation."}

A limitation of GBML is its inability to adapt to real-world applications where input tasks are sampled from multiple distributions. An existing effort learns N initializations for tasks sampled from N distributions; roughly increasing training time by a factor of N. Instead, we use a single model initialization to learn distribution-specific parameters for every input task. This reduces negative knowledge transfer across distributions and overall computational cost. Specifically, we explore two ways of efficiently learning on multi-distribution tasks: 1) Binary Mask Perceptron (BMP), which learns distribution-specific layers, 2) Multi-modal Supermask (MMSUP), which learns distribution-specific parameters. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework (GEMS) on few-shot vision classification tasks.

Therefore, adapting knowledge from a labelled daytime domain to an unlabelled nighttime domain has been widely researched. In addition to labelled daytime datasets, existing nighttime datasets usually provide nighttime images with corresponding daytime reference images captured at nearby locations for reference. The key challenge is to minimize the performance gap between the two domains. In this paper, we propose LoopDA for domain adaptive nighttime semantic segmentation. It consists of self-loops that result in reconstructing the input data using predicted semantic maps, by rendering them into the encoded features. In a warm-up training stage, the self-loops comprise of an inner-loop and an outer-loop, which are responsible for intra-domain refinement and inter-domain alignment, respectively. To reduce the impact of day-night pose shifts, in the later self-training stage, we propose a co-teaching pipeline that involves an offline pseudo-supervision signal and an online reference-guided signal 'DNA' (Day-Night Agreement), bringing substantial benefits to enhance nighttime segmentation. Our model outperforms prior methods on Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets for semantic segmentation. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/fy-vision/LoopDA."}

The multiple cameras with different focal lengths in mobile devices aid recent works in RefVSR, which aim to super-resolve a low-resolution ultra-wide video by utilizing wide-angle videos. Previous works in RefVSR used all reference frames of a Ref video at each time step for the super-resolution of low-resolution videos. However, computation on higher-resolution images increases the runtime and memory consumption, hence hinders the practical application of RefVSR. To solve this problem, we propose an Efficient Reference-based Video Super-Resolution (ERVSR) that exploits a single reference frame to super-resolve whole low-resolution video frames. We introduce an attention-based feature align module and an aggregation upsampling module that attends LR features using the correlation between the reference and LR frames. The proposed ERVSR achieves 12xfaster speed, 1/4 memory consumption than previous state-of-the-art RefVSR networks, and competitive performance on the RealMCVSR dataset while using a single reference image."}

However, such advancements often come at the cost of an increase of model memory and computational requirements. This represents a significant limitation for the deployability of research output in realistic settings, where the cost, the energy consumption, and the complexity of the framework play a crucial role. To solve this issue, the designer should search for models that maximise the performance while limiting its footprint. Typical approaches to reach this goal rely either on manual procedures, which cannot guarantee the optimality of the final design, or upon Neural Architecture Search algorithms to automatise the process, at the expenses of extremely high computational time. This paper provides a solution for the fast identification of a neural network that maximises the model accuracy while preserving size and computational constraints typical of tiny devices. Our approach, named FreeREA, is a custom cell-based evolution NAS algorithm that exploits an optimised combination of training-free metrics to rank architectures during the search, thus without need of model training. Our experiments, carried out on the common benchmarks NAS-Bench-101 and NATS-Bench, demonstrate that i) FreeREA is a fast, efficient and effective search method for models automatic design; ii) it outperforms State of the Art training-based and training-free techniques in all the datasets and benchmarks considered, and iii) it can easily generalise to constrained scenarios, representing a competitive solution for fast Neural Architecture Search in generic constrained applications.

Such falsifications range from cheapfakes (e.g., lookalikes or audio dubbing) to deepfakes (e.g., sophisticated AI media synthesis methods), which are becoming perceptually indistinguishable from real videos. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-modal semantic forensic approach to discover clues that go beyond detecting discrepancies in visual quality, thereby handling both simpler cheapfakes and visually persuasive deepfakes. In this work, our goal is to verify that the purported person seen in the video is indeed themselves by detecting anomalous facial movements corresponding to the spoken words. We leverage the idea of attribution to learn person-specific biometric patterns that distinguish a given speaker from others. We use interpretable Action Units (AUs) to capture a persons' face and head movement as opposed to deep CNN features, and we are the first to use word-conditioned facial motion analysis. We further demonstrate our method's effectiveness on a range of fakes not seen in training including those without video manipulation, that were not addressed in prior work."}

Recent works have therefore assessed their methods using human studies, which is not scalable and involves significant effort. This paper proposes a novel face-centric metric based on an adversarial framework where a generator simulates face restoration and a discriminator assesses image quality. Specifically, our per-pixel discriminator enables interpretable evaluation that cannot be provided by traditional metrics. Moreover, our metric emphasizes facial primary regions considering that even minor changes to the eyes, nose, and mouth significantly affect human cognition. Our face-oriented metric consistently surpasses existing general or facial image quality assessment metrics by impressive margins. We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed strategy in various architectural designs and challenging scenarios. Interestingly, we find that our IFQA can lead to performance improvement as an objective function. The code and models are available at https://github.com/VCLLab/IFQA."}

One early breakthrough was CycleGAN that emphasizes one-to-one mappings between two unpaired image domains via generative-adversarial networks (GAN) coupled with the cycle-consistency constraint, while more recent works promote one-to-many mapping to boost diversity of the translated images. Motivated by scientific simulation and one-to-one needs, this work revisits the classic CycleGAN framework and boosts its performance to outperform more contemporary models without relaxing the cycle-consistency constraint. To achieve this, we equip the generator with a Vision Transformer (ViT) and employ necessary training and regularization techniques. Compared to previous best-performing models, our model performs better and retains a strong correlation between the original and translated image. An accompanying ablation study shows that both the gradient penalty and self-supervised pre-training are crucial to the improvement.

Most existing approaches rely on cameras only to perform segmentation in BEV space, which is fundamentally constrained by the absence of reliable depth information. Latest works leverage both camera and LiDAR modalities, but sub-optimally fuse their features using simple, concatenation-based mechanisms. In this paper, we address these problems by enhancing the alignment of the unimodal features in order to aid feature fusion, as well as enhancing the alignment between the cameras' perspective view (PV) and BEV representations. We propose X-Align, a novel end-to-end cross-modal and cross-view learning framework for BEV segmentation consisting of the following components: (i) a novel Cross-Modal Feature Alignment (X-FA) loss, (ii) an attention-based Cross-Modal Feature Fusion (X-FF) module to align multi-modal BEV features implicitly, and (iii) an auxiliary PV segmentation branch with Cross-View Segmentation Alignment (X-SA) losses to improve the PV-to-BEV transformation. We evaluate our proposed method across two commonly used benchmark datasets, i.e., nuScenes and KITTI-360. Notably, X-Align significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3 absolute mIoU points on nuScenes. We also provide extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the individual components."}

To overcome such problems and achieve real-time face swapping, we propose a lightweight one-stage framework, FastSwap. We design a shallow network trained in a self-supervised manner without any manual annotations. The core of our framework is a novel decoder block, called Triple Adaptive Normalization (TAN) block, which effectively integrates the identity and pose information. Besides, we propose a novel data augmentation and switch-test strategy to extract the attributes from the target image, which further enables controllable attribute editing. Extensive experiments on VoxCeleb2 and wild faces demonstrate that our framework generates high-fidelity face swapping results in 123.22 FPS and better preserves the identity, pose, and attributes than other state-of-the-art methods.

The traditional HR estimation methods, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and photoplethysmographs, require skin contact. Due to the increased risk of viral infection from skin contact, these approaches are avoided in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Alternatively, one can use the non-contact HR estimation technique, remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), wherein HR is estimated from the facial videos of a person. Unfortunately, the existing rPPG methods perform poorly in the presence of facial deformations. Recently, there has been a proliferation of deep learning networks for rPPG. However, these networks require large-scale labelled data for better generalization. To alleviate these shortcomings, we propose a method ALPINE, that is, A noveL rPPG technique for Improving the remote heart rate estimatioN using contrastive lEarning. ALPINE utilizes the contrastive learning framework during training to address the issue of limited labelled data and introduces diversity in the data samples for better network generalization. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid loss comprising contrastive loss, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss and data fidelity loss. Our novel contrastive loss maximizes the similarity between the rPPG information from different facial regions, thereby minimizing the effect of local noise. The SNR loss improves the quality of temporal signals, and the data fidelity loss ensures that the correct rPPG signal is extracted. Our extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method, ALPINE outperforms the previous well-known rPPG methods."}

Thanks to the availability of smartphones with cameras and easy-to-use editing software, images can be remixed (i.e., redacted, edited, and recombined with other content) on-the-fly and with a worldwide audience that can repeat the process. From digital art to memes, the evolution of images through time is now an important topic of study for digital humanists, social scientists, and media forensics specialists. However, because typical data sets in computer vision are composed of static content, the development of automated algorithms to analyze remixed content has been limited. In this paper, we introduce the idea of Motif Mining -- the process of finding and summarizing remixed image content in large collections of unlabeled and unsorted data. In this paper, this idea is formalized and a reference implementation is introduced. Experiments are conducted on three meme-style data sets, including a newly collected set associated with the information war in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. The proposed motif mining approach is able to identify related remixed content that, when compared to similar approaches, more closely aligns with the preferences and expectations of human observers."}

We present a framework, OutfitTransformer, that uses the proposed task-specific tokens and leverages the self-attention mechanism to learn effective outfit-level representations encoding the compatibility relations between all items in the entire outfit for addressing both compatibility prediction and complementary item retrieval. For compatibility prediction, we design an outfit token to capture a global outfit representation and train the framework using a classification loss. For complementary item retrieval, we design a target item token that additionally takes the target item specification (in the form of a category or text description) into consideration. We train our framework using a proposed set-wise outfit ranking loss to generate a target item embedding given an outfit, and a target item specification as inputs. The generated target item embedding is then used to retrieve compatible items that match the rest of the outfit. Additionally, we adopt a pre-training approach and a curriculum learning strategy to improve retrieval performance. Experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on compatibility prediction, fill-in-the-blank, and complementary item retrieval tasks."}

Recently, large gains were made on this task for the domain of natural images using self-supervised contrastive feature learning as a first step followed by kNN or traditional one-class classifiers for feature scoring. Learned representations that are non-uniformly distributed on the unit hypersphere have been shown to be beneficial for this task. We go a step further and investigate how the ph  geometrical compactness  of the ID feature distribution makes isolating and detecting outliers easier, especially in the realistic situation when ID training data is polluted with OOD data. We propose novel architectural modifications to the self-supervised feature learning step, that enable such compact distributions for ID data to be learned. We show that the proposed modifications can be effectively applied to most existing self-supervised objectives, with large gains in performance. Furthermore, this improved OOD performance is obtained without resorting to tricks such as using strongly augmented ID images (e.g. by 90 degree rotations) as proxies for the unseen OOD data, as these impose overly prescriptive assumptions about ID data and its invariances. We perform extensive studies on benchmark datasets for one-class OOD detection and show state-of-the-art performance in the presence of pollution in the ID data, and comparable performance otherwise. We also propose and extensively evaluate a novel feature scoring technique based on the angular Mahalanobis distance, and propose a simple and novel technique for feature ensembling during evaluation that enables a big boost in performance at nearly zero run-time cost compared to the standard use of model ensembling or test time augmentations.

Using the information, the LF de-occlusion (LF-DeOcc) task aims to reconstruct the occlusion-free center view image. Existing LF-DeOcc studies mainly focus on the sparsely sampled (sparse) LF images where most of the occluded regions are visible in other views due to the large disparity. In this paper, we expand LF-DeOcc in more challenging datasets, densely sampled (dense) LF images, which are taken by a micro-lens-based portable LF camera. Due to the small disparity ranges of dense LF images, most of the background regions are invisible in any view. To apply LF-DeOcc in both LF datasets, we propose a framework, ISTY, which is defined and divided into three roles: (1) extract LF features, (2) define the occlusion, and (3) inpaint occluded regions. By dividing the framework into three specialized components according to the roles, the development and analysis can be easier. Furthermore, an explainable intermediate representation, an occlusion mask, can be obtained in the proposed framework. The occlusion mask is useful for comprehensive analysis of the model and other applications by manipulating the mask. In experiments, qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art LF-DeOcc methods in both sparse and dense LF datasets."}

To adapt to novel tasks with unseen categories, we further meta-learn a light-weight transformation to enhance the inter-class margins. As an additional benefit, this light-weight transformation lets us exploit the query data for label propagation from labeled to unlabeled data without any auxiliary network components. The explicitly geometry-regularized feature subspaces allow the classifiers on novel tasks to be inferred in a closed form, with an adaptive subspace truncation that selectively discards non-discriminative dimensions.

Automated segmentation of wound regions from patient images can aid clinicians in measuring and managing chronic wounds and monitoring the wound healing trajectory. While there exists a plethora of work on general medical image segmentation, there is hardly any work on wound image analysis and segmentation. Existing methods are limited to segmenting a smaller subset of ulcers, such as foot ulcers, with no special processing for wound images. In this paper, we build segmentation models for eight different types of wound images. Wound image analysis is a challenging problem due to the lack of availability of extensive data (labeled or unlabeled) and annotation challenges due to the shortage of well-trained wound care clinicians. To handle these challenges, we contribute WoundSeg, a large and diverse dataset of segmented wound images. Generic wound image segmentation is complex due to the heterogeneous appearance of wound area across images of similar wound types. We propose a novel image segmentation framework, WSNet, which leverages (a) wound-domain adaptive pretraining on a large unlabeled wound image collection and (b) a global-local architecture that utilizes full image and its patches to learn fine-grained details of heterogeneous wounds. On WoundSeg, we achieve a decent Dice score of 0.847. On existing AZH Woundcare and Medetec datasets, we establish a new state-of-the-art.

The calibration module iteratively minimizes the segment reprojection error induced by the estimated camera parameters.

We perform experiments on a novel synthetic dataset for inventory management in retail, which we construct and make publicly available to the community. Our results show that regression-based 3D counting methods systematically outperform detection-based methods, and reveal that directly learning from raw point clouds greatly assists count estimation under extreme occlusion.

In its warm-up domain adaptation stage, the model learns a fully-supervised object detector (FSOD) to improve the precision of the object proposals in the target domain, and at the same time learns target-domain-specific and detection-aware proposal features. In its main WSOD stage, a WSOD model is specifically tuned to the target domain. The feature extractor and the object proposal generator of the WSOD model are built upon the fine-tuned FSOD model.

In practice, we utilize a hypernetwork, which takes the aggregated information from support data and returns the classifier's parameters handcrafted for the considered problem. Moreover, we introduce the kernel-based representation of the support examples delivered to hypernetwork to create the parameters of the classification module. Consequently, we rely on relations between embeddings of the support examples instead of direct feature values provided by the backbone models.

In cluttered and crowded environments, monocular multi-object tracking (MOT) systems often fail due to occlusions. Multiple highly overlapped cameras are capable of recovering partial 3D information. When used properly, 3D data can significantly alleviate the occlusion issue. However, training a multi-camera tracker demands a large-scale multi-camera tracking dataset with diverse camera settings and backgrounds. These requirements make the collection of multi-camera tracking dataset challenging and expensive. The cost of creating such a dataset has limited the availability and scale of datasets in this domain. Instead, we appeal to an auto-annotation system to reduce the cost. The system uses overlapped and calibrated depth and RGB cameras to build a 3D tracker and automatically generates the 3D tracking results. We then manually check and correct the 3D tracking results to ensure the label quality, which is much cheaper than solely manual annotation. Next, the 3D tracking results are projected to each calibrated RGB camera view to create 2D tracking results. In this way, we collect and annotate a large-scale densely labeled multi-camera tracking dataset from five different environments. We have conducted extensive experiments using two real-time multi-camera trackers and a person re-identification (ReID) model under different settings. This dataset provides a reliable benchmark for multi-camera, multi-object tracking systems in cluttered and crowded environments. We expect this benchmark to encourage more research attempts in this domain. Also, our results demonstrate that adapting the trackers and ReID models on this dataset significantly improves their performance. Our dataset will be publicly released upon the acceptance of this work."}

LSRNet operates at low-resolution and computes a low-resolution, shadow-free output. It achieves state-of-the-art results on standard datasets with 65x lesser network parameters than existing methods. This is followed by DRNet, which is tasked to refine the low-resolution output to a high-resolution output using the high-resolution input shadow image as guidance. We construct high-resolution shadow removal datasets and through our experiments, prove the effectiveness of our proposed method on them. It is then demonstrated that this method can be deployed on modern day smartphones and is the first of its kind solution that can efficiently (2.4secs) perform shadow removal for high-resolution images (12MP) in these devices. Like many existing approaches, our shadow removal network relies on a shadow region mask as input to the network. To complement the lightweight shadow removal network, we also propose a lightweight shadow detector in this paper."}

Although current point cloud classification models have achieved satisfactory accuracies, most of them trade slight performance gains by stacking complex modules on the grouping-local-global framework, which leads to prolonged processing time and deteriorating interpretability. In this work, we propose a new pipeline named Fractual Projection Forest (FPF) that exploits fractal features to enable traditional machine learning models to achieve competitive performance with DNNs on classification tasks. Though compromises by few percentages in accuracy compared to DNNs, FPF is faster, more interpretable, and easily extendable. We hope that FPF may provide the community with a novel view of point cloud classification. Our code is available on https://github.com/Explain3D/FracProjForest."}

Text-to-image matching is the most common form of cross-modal retrieval where given a large database of images and a textual query, the task is to retrieve the most relevant set of images. Existing methods utilize dual encoders with an attention mechanism and a ranking loss for learning embeddings that can be used for retrieval based on cosine similarity. Despite the fact that existing methods attempt to perform semantic alignment across visual regions and textual words using tailored attention mechanisms, there is no explicit supervision from the training objective to enforce such alignment. To address this, we propose NAPReg, a novel regularization formulation that projects high-level semantic entities i.e Nouns into the embedding space as shared learnable proxies. We show that using such a formulation allows the attention mechanism to learn better word-region alignment while also utilizing region information from other samples to build a more generalized latent representation for semantic concepts. Experiments on three benchmark datasets i.e. MS-COCO, Flickr30k and Flickr8k demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in cross-modal metric learning for text-image and image-text retrieval tasks."}

They take the place of the actors in dangerous stunt scenes or scenes where the same actor plays multiple characters. The double's face is later replaced with the actor's face and expressions manually using expensive CGI technology, costing millions of dollars and taking months to complete. An automated, inexpensive, and fast way can be to use face-swapping techniques that aim to swap an identity from a source face video (or an image) to a target face video. However, such methods cannot preserve the source expressions of the actor important for the scene's context. To tackle this challenge, we introduce video-to-video (V2V) face-swapping, a novel task of face-swapping that can preserve (1) the identity and expressions of the source (actor) face video and (2) the background and pose of the target (double) video. We propose FaceOff, a V2V face-swapping system that operates by learning a robust blending operation to merge two face videos following the constraints above. It reduces the videos to a quantized latent space and then blends them in the reduced space. FaceOff is trained in a self-supervised manner and robustly tackles the non-trivial challenges of V2V face-swapping. As shown in the experimental section, FaceOff significantly outperforms alternate approaches qualitatively and quantitatively."}

It is essential for point-interactive colorization methods to appropriately propagate user-provided colors (i.e., user hints) in the entire image to obtain a reasonably colorized image with minimal user effort. However, existing approaches often produce partially colorized results due to the inefficient design of stacking convolutional layers to propagate hints to distant relevant regions. To address this problem, we present iColoriT, a novel point-interactive colorization Vision Transformer capable of propagating user hints to relevant regions, leveraging the global receptive field of Transformers. The self-attention mechanism of Transformers enables iColoriT to selectively colorize relevant regions with only a few local hints. Our approach colorizes images in real-time by utilizing pixel shuffling, an efficient upsampling technique that replaces the decoder architecture. Also, in order to mitigate the artifacts caused by pixel shuffling with large upsampling ratios, we present the local stabilizing layer. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach highly outperforms existing methods for point-interactive colorization, producing accurately colorized images with a user's minimal effort.

We propose to address the background shift with a novel classifier initialization method which employs gradient-based attribution to identify the most relevant weights for new classes from the classifier's weights for the previous background and transfers these weights to the new classifier. This warm-start weight initialization provides a general solution applicable to several CISS methods. Furthermore, it accelerates learning of new classes while mitigating forgetting. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvement in mIoU compared to the state-of-the-art CISS methods on the Pascal-VOC 2012, ADE20K and Cityscapes datasets."}

Most of the attacks proposed have targeted the model's integrity (i.e., caused the model to make incorrect predictions), while adversarial attacks targeting the model's availability, a critical aspect in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, have not yet been explored by the machine learning research community. In this paper, we propose a novel attack that negatively affects the decision latency of an end-to-end object detection pipeline. We craft a universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) that targets a widely used technique integrated in many object detector pipelines - non-maximum suppression (NMS). Our experiments demonstrate the proposed UAP's ability to increase the processing time of individual frames by adding \"phantom\" objects that overload the NMS algorithm while preserving the detection of the original objects which allows the attack to go undetected for a longer period of time."}

The detector clearly exhibits this bias when employed on a target dataset, particularly towards object sizes. However, object sizes vary heavily between domains due to, for instance, different labeling policies or geographical locations. State-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation approaches outsource methods to overcome the object size bias. Mainstream size adaptation approaches exploit target domain statistics, contradicting the original unsupervised assumption. Our novel unsupervised anchor calibration method addresses this limitation. Given a model trained on the source data, we estimate the optimal target anchors in a completely unsupervised manner. The main idea stems from an intuitive observation: by varying the anchor sizes for the target domain, we inevitably introduce noise or even remove valuable object cues. The latent object representation, perturbed by the anchor size, is closest to the learned source features only under the optimal target anchors. We leverage this observation for anchor size optimization. Our experimental results show that, without any retraining, we achieve competitive results even compared to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised size adaptation approaches. In addition, our anchor calibration can be combined with such existing methods, making them completely unsupervised."}

However, the developed deep reconstruction models are generally limited in generalization when applied to unseen testing samples in target domain. Furthermore, privacy concerns may impede the availability of source-domain training data to retrain or adapt the model to the target-domain testing data, which are quite common in real-world medical applications. To address these issues, we introduce a source-free black-box test-time adaptation method for sparse-view CT reconstruction with unknown noise levels based on prior-informed implicit neural representation learning (PINER). By leveraging implicit neural representation learning to generate the image representations at various noise levels, the proposed method is able to construct the adapted input representations at test time based on the inference of black-box model and output analysis. We performed experiments of source-free test-time adaptation for sparse-view CT reconstruction with unknown noise levels on multiple anatomical sites with different black-box deep reconstruction models, where our method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms."}

Existing works use this technique to provably secure a pretrained non-robust model by training a custom denoiser network on entire training data. However, access to the training set may be restricted to a handful of data samples due to constraints such as high transmission cost and the proprietary nature of the data. Thus, we formulate a novel problem of \"how to certify the robustness of pretrained models using only a few training samples\". We observe that training the custom denoiser directly using the existing techniques on limited samples yields poor certification. To overcome this, our proposed approach (DE-CROP) generates class-boundary and interpolated samples corresponding to each training sample, ensuring high diversity in the feature space of the pretrained classifier. We train the denoiser by maximizing the similarity between the denoised output of the generated sample and the original training sample in the classifier's logit space. We also perform distribution level matching using domain discriminator and maximum mean discrepancy that yields further benefit. In white box setup, we obtain significant improvements over the baseline on multiple benchmark datasets and also report similar performance under the challenging black box setup."}

With this assumption, the long-standing principle behind flow estimation consists in optimizing a photometric loss that maximizes the similarity between paired pixels in successive frames. However, these frames could be subject to strong brightness changes due to the radiometric properties of scenes as well as their viewing conditions. In this paper, we present BrightFlow, a new method to train any optical flow estimation network in an unsupervised manner. It consists in training two networks that jointly estimate optical flow and brightness changes. These changes are then compensated in the photometric loss so that reconstruction errors due to shadows or reflections will not affect negatively the training. As this compensation mechanism is only used at training stage, our method does not impact the number of parameters or the complexity at inference. Extensive experiments conducted on standard datasets and optical flow architectures show a consistent gain of our method. Source code is available at https://github.com/CEA-LIST/BrightFlow."}

While processing this information might seem effortless for human brains, it is challenging to build a machine that can perform similar tasks since complex interactions cannot be dealt with a single type of integration but require more sophisticated approaches. In this paper, we propose a new simple method to address the multisensory integration in video understanding. Unlike previous works where a single fusion type is used, we design a multi-head model with individual event-specific layers to deal with different audio-visual relationships, enabling different ways of audio-visual fusion. Experimental results show that our event-specific layers can discover unique properties of the audio-visual relationships in the videos, e.g., semantically matched moments, and rhythmic events. Moreover, although our network is trained with single labels, our multi-head design can inherently output additional semantically meaningful multi-labels for a video. As an application, we demonstrate that our proposed method can expose the extent of event-characteristics of popular benchmark datasets."}

In this paper we systematically compare the impact of adding transformer structures into state-of-the-art segmentation models for overhead imagery. Each model is given a similar budget of free parameters, and their hyperparameters are optimized using Bayesian Optimization with a fixed quantity of data and computation time. We conduct our experiments with a large and diverse dataset comprising two large public benchmarks: Inria and DeepGlobe. We perform additional ablation studies to explore the impact of specific transformer-based modeling choices. Our results suggest that transformers provide consistent, but modest, performance improvements. We only observe this advantage however in hybrid models that combine convolutional and transformer-based structures, while fully transformer-based models achieve relatively poor performance."}

To address this limitation, we present an anchor-free parametric lane representation, which defines traffic lines as continuous curves in 3D space. Choosing splines as our representation, we show their superiority over polynomials of different degrees that were proposed in previous 2D lane detection approaches. Our continuous representation allows us to model even complex lane shapes at any position in the 3D space, while implicitly enforcing smoothness constraints. Our model is validated on a synthetic 3D lane dataset including a variety of scenes in terms of complexity of road shape and illumination.

Decades-old photos often suffer from severe and commingled degradation such as cracks, defocus, and color-fading, which are difficult to treat individually and harder to repair when they interact. Deep learning presents a plausible avenue, but the lack of large-scale datasets of old photos makes addressing this restoration task very challenging. Here we present a novel reference-based end-to-end learning framework that is able to both repair and colorize old, degraded pictures. Our proposed framework consists of three modules: a restoration sub-network that conducts restoration from degradations, a similarity network that performs color histogram matching and color transfer, and a colorization subnet that learns to predict the chroma elements of images conditioned on chromatic reference signals. The overall system makes uses of color histogram priors from reference images, which greatly reduces the need for large-scale training data. We have also created a first-of-a-kind public dataset of real old photos that are paired with ground truth \"pristine\" photos that have been manually restored by PhotoShop experts.

Experiments on cross-view benchmark datasets including NTU RGB+D dataset show that ViewCLR stands as a state-of-the-art viewpoint invariant self-supervised method."}

However, current methods typically randomly sample video clips for learning, which results in an imperfect supervisory signal. In this work, we propose PreViTS, an SSL framework that utilizes an unsupervised tracking signal for selecting clips containing the same object, which helps better utilize temporal transformations of objects. PreViTS further uses the tracking signal to spatially constrain the frame regions to learn from and trains the model to locate meaningful objects by providing supervision on Grad-CAM attention maps. To evaluate our approach, we train a momentum contrastive (MoCo) encoder on VGG-Sound and Kinetics-400 datasets with PreViTS. Training with PreViTS outperforms representations learnt by contrastive strategy alone on video downstream tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on action classification. PreViTS helps learn feature representations that are more robust to changes in background and context, as seen by experiments on datasets with background changes. Learning from large-scale videos with PreViTS could lead to more accurate and robust visual feature representations."}

We observe that prior works operate on instance-level feature aggregation that imminently neglects the refined pixel-level representation, resulting in confusion among objects sharing similar appearance or motion characteristics. To address this limitation, we pro- pose BoxMask, which effectively learns discriminative representations by incorporating class-aware pixel-level information. We simply consider bounding box-level annotations as a coarse mask for each object to supervise our method.

Inconsistent settings continue to be the root causes for contradictory conclusions and in worst cases, for incorrect appraisal of methods. Our community is in search of a unified framework for exhaustive and fair evaluation of deep active learning. In this paper, we provide just such a framework, one which is built upon systematically fixing, containing and interpreting sources of randomness. We isolate different influence factors, such as neural-network initialization or hardware specifics, to assess their impact on the learning performance. We then use our framework to analyze the effects of basic AL settings, such as the query-batch size and the use of subset selection, and different datasets on AL performance. Our findings enable us to derive specific recommendations for the reliable evaluation of deep active learning, thus helping advance the community toward a more normative evaluation of results."}

NeRF-based approaches are effective for novel view synthesis, however such models memorize the radiance for every point in a scene within a neural network. Since these models are scene-specific and lack a 3D scene representation, classical editing such as shape manipulation, or combining scenes is not possible. While there are some recent hybrid approaches that combine NeRF with external scene representations such as sparse voxels, planes, hash tables, etc., they focus mostly on efficiency and don't explore the scene editing and manipulation capabilities of hybrid approaches. With the aim of exploring controllable scene representations for novel view synthesis, our model couples learnt scene-specific 3D feature volumes with a general NeRF rendering network. We can generalize to novel scenes by optimizing only the scene-specific 3D feature volume, while keeping the parameters of the rendering network fixed. Since the feature volumes are independent of the rendering model, we can manipulate and combine scenes by editing their corresponding feature volumes. The edited volume can then be plugged into the rendering model to synthesise high-quality novel views. We demonstrate scene manipulations including: scene mixing; applying rigid and non-rigid transformations; inserting, moving and deleting objects in a scene; while producing photo-realistic novel-view synthesis results."}

However, the cost of unquantised training is overlooked, despite requiring significantly more time and energy than inference. We present a method for quantizing convolutional neural networks for efficient training. Quantizing gradients is challenging because it requires higher granularity and their values span a wider range than the weight and feature maps. We propose an extension of the Channel-wise Block Floating Point format that allows for quick gradient computation, using a minimal amount of quantization time. This is achieved through sharing an exponent across both depth and batch dimensions in order to quantize tensors once and reuse them during backpropagation. We test our method using standard models such as AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet, on the CIFAR10, SVHN and ImageNet datasets. We show no loss of accuracy when quantizing AlexNet weights, activations and gradients to only 4 bits training ImageNet."}

A balance between stability and plasticity of the incremental process is needed in order to obtain good accuracy for past as well as new classes. Existing exemplar-free class-incremental methods focus either on successive fine tuning of the model, thus favoring plasticity, or on using a feature extractor fixed after the initial incremental state, thus favoring stability. We introduce a method which combines a fixed feature extractor and a pseudo-features generator to improve the stability-plasticity balance. The generator uses a simple yet effective geometric translation of new class features to create representations of past classes, made of pseudo-features. The translation of features only requires the storage of the centroid representations of past classes to produce their pseudo-features. Actual features of new classes and pseudo-features of past classes are fed into a linear classifier which is trained incrementally to discriminate between all classes. The incremental process is much faster with the proposed method compared to mainstream ones which update the entire deep model. Experiments are performed with three challenging datasets, and different incremental settings. A comparison with ten existing methods shows that our method outperforms the others in most cases.

Exploiting the linearity between the qualities and their comparison scores induced by the utilized loss, our quality-aware comparison function is simple and highly generalizable. The experiments conducted on several face recognition databases and benchmarks demonstrate that the introduced quality-awareness leads to consistent improvements in the recognition performance. Moreover, the proposed QMagFace approach performs especially well under challenging circumstances, such as cross-pose, cross-age, or cross-quality.

State-of-the-art approaches provide good results, however, they rely on deep learning architectures of arbitrary complexity, such as Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN), Transformers or Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN), typically requiring multiple training stages and more than 2 million parameters. In this paper, we show that, after combining with a series of standard practices, such as applying Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), predicting residual displacement of joints and optimizing velocity as an auxiliary loss, a light-weight network based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with only 0.14 million parameters can surpass the state-of-the-art performance. An exhaustive evaluation on the Human3.6M, AMASS, and 3DPW datasets shows that our method, named siMLPe, consistently outperforms all other approaches.

However, the high densities, tight contacts, and weak boundaries of the cells pose substantial technical challenges. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a new instance segmentation model, which we refer to as single-cell Transformer segmenter (SCTS). It utilizes a Swin Transformer as its backbone, combining the global modeling capabilities of a Transformer and the local modeling capabilities of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to ensure model adaptability to different cell sizes, shapes, and textures. It also embeds a three-class (background, cell interior, and cell boundary) semantic segmentation branch to classify pixels and to provide semantic features for downstream tasks. The prediction of boundary semantics improves boundary awareness, and the differentiation between foreground and background semantics improves segmentation integrity in regions with weak signals. To reduce the need for annotated training data, we have developed an augmentation strategy that randomly fills instances of single cells into open spaces of training images. Experiments show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art models on the LIVECell dataset and an in-house dataset.

Methods based on 3D Morphable Models (3DMM), and their combination with differentiable renderers, have shown promising results. However, the expressiveness of 3DMMs is limited, and they typically yield over-smoothed and identity-agnostic 3D shapes limited to the face region. Highly accurate full head reconstructions have recently been obtained with neural fields that parameterize the geometry using multilayer perceptrons. The versatility of these representations has also proved effective for disentangling geometry, materials and lighting. However, these methods require several tens of input images. In this paper, we introduce SIRA, a method which, from a single image, reconstructs human head avatars with high fidelity geometry and factorized lights and surface materials. Our key ingredients are two data-driven statistical models based on neural fields that resolve the ambiguities of single-view 3D surface reconstruction and appearance factorization. Experiments show that SIRA obtains state of the art results in 3D head reconstruction while at the same time it successfully disentangles the global illumination, and the diffuse and specular albedos. Furthermore, our reconstructions are amenable to physically-based appearance editing and head model relighting."}

The transformer expanding path models the temporal coherency between embryo images to ensure monotonic non-decreasing constraint and is optimized by a segmentation head.

Vector quantization aims at reducing the model size by indexing model weights with full-precision embeddings, i.e., codewords, while the index needs to be restored to 32-bit during computation. Binary and other low-precision quantization methods can reduce the model size up to 32x, however, at the cost of a considerable accuracy drop. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for ternary quantization to produce smaller and more accurate compressed models. By integrating hyperspherical learning, pruning and reinitialization, our proposed Hyperspherical Quantization (HQ) method reduces the cosine distance between the full-precision and ternary weights, thus reducing the bias of the straight-through gradient estimator during ternary quantization. Compared with existing work at similar compression levels ( 30x,  40x), our method significantly improves the test accuracy and reduces the model size."}

We observe that, while different model architectures achieve similar performance on benchmarks, visual variations between predicted saliency maps are still significant. Inspired by this intuition, we propose a lightweight model that employs multiple simple heterogeneous decoders and adopts several practical approaches to improve accuracy while keeping computational costs low, such as hierarchical multi-map knowledge distillation, multi-output saliency prediction, unlabeled auxiliary datasets and channel reduction with teacher assistant supervision. Our approach achieves saliency prediction accuracy on par or better than state-of-the-art methods on DFH1K, UCF-Sports and Hollywood2 benchmarks, while enhancing significantly the efficiency of the model."}

We present a novel efficient action recognition algorithm, which allocates computational resources adaptively to individual frames depending on their relevance and significance. Specifically, our algorithm adopts LSTM-based policy modules and sequentially estimates the usefulness of each frame based on their intermediate representations. If a certain frame is unlikely to be helpful for recognizing actions, our model stops forwarding the features to the rest of the layers and starts to consider the next sampled frame. We further reduce the computational cost of our approach by introducing a simple yet effective early termination strategy during the inference procedure. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on three public benchmarks: ActivityNet-v1.3, Mini-Kinetics, and THUMOS'14. Our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves outstanding trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in action recognition."}

Other state-of-the-art works mainly focus on fully supervised learning approaches that rely heavily on human annotations. However, the scarcity of labeled and unlabeled data is a long-standing challenge in histopathology. Currently, representation learning without labels remains unexplored in the histopathology domain. The proposed method, Magnification Prior Contrastive Similarity (MPCS), enables self-supervised learning of representations without labels on small-scale breast cancer dataset BreakHis by exploiting magnification factor, inductive transfer, and reducing human prior. The proposed method matches fully supervised learning state-of-the-art performance in malignancy classification when only 20% of labels are used in fine-tuning and outperform previous works in fully supervised learning settings for three public breast cancer datasets, including BreakHis. Further, It provides initial support for a hypothesis that reducing human-prior leads to efficient representation learning in self-supervision, which will need further investigation.

However, many real-life datasets are only partially labeled. We propose a semi-supervised machine learning training strategy to improve event detection performance on sequential data, such as video recordings, when only sparse labels are available, such as event start times without their corresponding end times. Our method uses noisy guesses of the events' end times to train event detection models. Depending on how conservative these guesses are, mislabeled samples may be introduced into the training set. We further propose a mathematical model for explaining and estimating the evolution of the classification performance for increasingly noisier end time estimates. We show that neural networks can improve their detection performance by leveraging more training data with less conservative approximations despite the higher proportion of incorrect labels. We adapt sequential versions of CIFAR-10 and MNIST, and use the Berkeley MHAD and HMBD51 video datasets to empirically evaluate our method, and find that our risk-tolerant strategy outperforms conservative estimates by 3.5 points of mean average precision for CIFAR, 30 points for MNIST, 3 points for MHAD, and 14 points for HMBD51. Then, we leverage the proposed training strategy to tackle a real-life application: processing continuous video recordings of epilepsy patients, and show that our method outperforms baseline labeling methods by 17 points of average precision, and reaches a classification performance similar to that of fully supervised models."}

The sketch-to-photo translation is a computer vision task that enables a machine to do this imagination, taking a binary sketch image and generating plausible RGB images corresponding to the sketch. Hence, deep neural networks for this task should learn to generate a wide range of frequencies because most parts of the input (binary sketch image) are composed of DC signals. In this paper, we propose a new loss function named Wavelet-domain High-Frequency Loss (WHFL) to overcome the limitations of previous methods that tend to have a bias toward low frequencies. The proposed method emphasizes the loss on the high frequencies by designing a new weight matrix imposing larger weights on the high bands. Unlike existing hand-craft methods that control frequency weights using binary masks, we use the matrix with finely controlled elements according to frequency scales. The WHFL is designed in a multi-scale form, which lets the loss function focus more on the high frequency according to decomposition levels. We use the WHFL as a complementary loss in addition to conventional ones defined in the spatial domain. Experiments show we can improve the qualitative and quantitative results in both spatial and frequency domains. Additionally, we attempt to verify the WHFL's high-frequency generation capability by defining a new evaluation metric named Unsigned Euclidean Distance Field Error (UEDFE)."}

However, this detection is challenging due to the visual similarity of melanocytes to other cells in routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images, leading to the failure of current nuclei detection methods. Stains such as Sox10 can mark melanocytes, but they require an additional step and expense and thus are not regularly used in clinical practice. To address these limitations, we introduce VSGD-Net, a novel detection network that learns melanocyte identification through virtual staining from H&E to Sox10. The method takes only routine H&E images during inference, resulting in a promising approach to support pathologists in the diagnosis of melanoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the detection problem using image synthesis features between two distinct pathology stainings. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art nuclei detection methods."}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the conditional generative neural radiance fields (CG-NeRF), which generates multi-view images that reflect multimodal input conditions such as images or text. However, generating 3D-aware images from multimodal conditions bears several challenges. First, each condition type has different amount of information - e.g., the amount of information in text and color images are significantly different. Furthermore, the pose-consistency is often violated when diversifying the generated images from input conditions. Addressing such challenges, we propose 1) a unified architecture that effectively handles multiple types of conditions, and 2) the pose-consistent diversity loss for generating various images while maintaining the view consistency. Experimental results show that the proposed method maintains consistent image quality on various multimodal condition types and achieves superior fidelity and diversity compared to the existing NeRF-based generative models."}

In this paper, we develop a computer vision based infant symmetry assessment system, leveraging 3D human pose estimation for infants. Evaluation and calibration of our system against ground truth assessments is complicated by our findings from a survey of human ratings of angle and symmetry, that such ratings exhibit low inter-rater reliability. To rectify this, we develop a Bayesian estimator of the ground truth derived from a probabilistic graphical model of fallible human raters. We show that the 3D infant pose estimation model can achieve 68% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve performance in predicting the Bayesian aggregate labels, compared to only 61% from a 2D infant pose estimation model and 60% from a 3D adult pose estimation model, highlighting the importance of 3D poses and infant domain knowledge in assessing infant body symmetry. Our survey analysis also suggests that human ratings are susceptible to higher levels of bias and inconsistency, and hence our final 3D pose-based symmetry assessment system is calibrated but not directly supervised by Bayesian aggregate human ratings, yielding higher levels of consistency and lower levels of inter-limb assessment bias."}

Recent works incorporating knowledge graphs with scene graphs prove effective in improving recall for the tail predicate classes.

To incorporate external knowledge, we construct a commonsense knowledge graph by integrating ConceptNet and Wikidata. To explicitly unbias SGG with knowledge in the reasoning process, we propose a novel framework, Explicit Ontological Adjustment (EOA), to adjust the graph model predictions with knowledge priors. We use the edge matrix from the commonsense knowledge graph as a module in the graph neural network model to refine the relationship detection process. This module proves effective in alleviating the long-tail distribution of predicates.

However, the transferability has not been understood in terms of to which class target model's predictions were misled (i.e., class-aware transferability). In this paper, we differentiate the cases in which a target model predicts the same wrong class as the source model (\"same mistake\") or a different wrong class (\"different mistake\") to analyze and provide an explanation of the mechanism. We find that (1) AEs tend to cause same mistakes, which correlates with \"non-targeted transferability\"; however, (2) different mistakes occur even between similar models, regardless of the perturbation size. Furthermore, we present evidence that the difference between same mistakes and different mistakes can be explained by non-robust features, predictive but human-uninterpretable patterns: different mistakes occur when non-robust features in AEs are used differently by models. Non-robust features can thus provide consistent explanations for the class-aware transferability of AEs."}

To this end, we proceed in two steps: Firstly, building upon the recent RAFT-3D approach, we develop an improved two-frame baseline by incorporating an advanced stereo method. Secondly, and even more importantly, exploiting the specific modeling concepts of RAFT-3D, we propose a U-Net architecture that performs a fusion of forward and backward flow estimates and hence allows to integrate temporal information on demand. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark do not only show that the advantages of the improved baseline and the temporal fusion approach complement each other, they also demonstrate that the computed scene flow is highly accurate.

However, these methods have the disadvantage of over-fitting and focusing on only a few specific forgery footprints. On the other hand, real-life manipulated images are generated via a wide variety of forgery operations and thus, leave behind a wide variety of forgery footprints. Therefore, we need a more general approach for image forgery localization that can work well on a variety of forgery conditions. A key assumption in underlying forged region localization is that there remains a difference of feature distribution between untampered and manipulated regions in each forged image sample, irrespective of the forgery type. In this paper, we aim to leverage this difference of feature distribution to aid in image forgery localization. Specifically, we use contrastive loss to learn mapping into a feature space where the features between untampered and manipulated regions are well-separated for each image. Also, our method has the advantage of localizing manipulated region without requiring any prior knowledge or assumption about the forgery type. We demonstrate that our work outperforms several existing methods on three benchmark image manipulation datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/niloy193/CFLNet."}

While the potentials of Convolutional Neural Networks for detection, classification and segmentation tasks have successfully been demonstrated in other application areas, this relatively new field currently lacks the required quantity and quality of training data for such a highly data-driven approach. Therefore, we propose a novel large-scale image dataset specializing in the fine-grained identification of 74 relevant crop and weed species with a strong emphasis on data variability. We provide annotations of labeled bounding boxes, semantic masks and stem positions for about 112k instances in more than 8k high-resolution images of both real-world agricultural sites and specifically cultivated outdoor plots of rare weed types. Additionally, each sample is enriched with an extensive set of meta-annotations regarding environmental conditions and recording parameters. We furthermore conduct benchmark experiments for multiple learning tasks on different variants of the dataset to demonstrate its versatility and provide examples of useful mapping schemes for tailoring the annotated data to the requirements of specific applications. In the course of the evaluation, we furthermore demonstrate how incorporating multiple species of weeds into the learning process increases the accuracy of crop detection. Overall, the evaluation clearly demonstrates that our dataset represents an essential step towards overcoming the data gap and promoting further research in the area of Precision Agriculture."}

Existing work in this area focuses on creating attention maps to capture the correlation between the two modalities to localize the source of the sound. In a video, oftentimes, the objects exhibiting movement are the ones generating the sound. In this work, we capture this characteristic by modeling the optical flow in a video as a prior to better aid in localizing the sound source. We further demonstrate that the addition of flow-based attention substantially improves visual sound source localization.

The tremendous improvements of deep generative networks have created various possibilities for improving such models and have attracted wide interest. Moreover, the recent advances in neural radiance fields, are revolutionising novel-view synthesis of known scenes. In this work, we present a facial 3D Morphable Model, which exploits both of the above, and can accurately model a subject's identity, pose and expression and render it in arbitrary illumination. This is achieved by utilizing a powerful deep style-based generator to overcome two main weaknesses of neural radiance fields, their rigidity and rendering speed. We introduce a style-based generative network that synthesizes in one pass all and only the required rendering samples of a neural radiance field. We create a vast labelled synthetic dataset of facial renders, and train the network, so that it can accurately model and generalize on facial identity, pose and appearance. Finally, we show that this model can accurately be fit to \"in-the-wild\" facial images of arbitrary pose and illumination, extract the facial characteristics, and be used to re-render the face in controllable conditions."}

Although the existing weak supervision methods work well in manipulating the style codes along one attribute, the accuracy of manipulating multiple attributes is neglected. Multi-attribute representations are prone to entanglement in the StyleGAN latent space, while sequential editing leads to error accumulation. To address these limitations, we design a Dynamic Style Manipulation Network (DyStyle) whose structure and parameters vary by input samples, to perform nonlinear and adaptive manipulation of latent codes for flexible and precise attribute control. In order to efficient and stable optimization of the DyStyle network, we propose a Dynamic Multi-Attribute Contrastive Learning (DmaCL) method: including dynamic multi-attribute contrastor and dynamic multi-attribute contrastive loss, which simultaneously disentangle a variety of attributes from the generative image and latent space of model. As a result, our approach demonstrates fine-grained disentangled edits along multiple numeric and binary attributes. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing style manipulation methods verify the superiority of our method in terms of the multi-attribute control accuracy and identity preservation without compromising photorealism."}

Obtaining accurate 3D human poses requires careful camera calibration which is difficult for non-technical personal or in a pop-up scenario. Recent markerless motion capture approaches require accurate camera calibration at least for the final triangulation step. Instead, we solve this problem by presenting ElliPose, Stereoscopic 3D Human Pose Estimation by Fitting Ellipsoids, where we jointly estimate the 3D human as well as the camera pose. We exploit the fact that bones do not change in length over the course of a sequence and thus their relative trajectories have to lie on the surface of a sphere which we can utilize to iteratively correct the camera and 3D pose estimation. As another use-case we demonstrate that our approach can be used as replacement for ground-truth 3D poses to train monocular 3D pose estimators. We show that our method produces competitive results even when comparing with state-of-the-art methods that use more cameras or ground-truth camera extrinsics."}

To this end, we propose a novel VideoQA task that requires reading and understanding the text in the video.

However, different attention maps methods can highlight different regions of the input, with sometimes contradictory explanations for a prediction. This effect is exacerbated when the training set is small. This indicates that either the model learned incorrect representations or that the attention maps methods did not accurately estimate the model's representations. We propose an unsupervised fine-tuning method that optimizes the consistency of attention maps and show that it improves both classification performance and the quality of attention maps. We propose an implementation for two state-of-the-art attention computation methods, Grad-CAM and Guided Backpropagation, which relies on an input masking technique. We also show results on Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients in an ablation study. We evaluate this method on our own dataset of event detection in continuous video recordings of hospital patients aggregated and curated for this work. As a sanity check, we also evaluate the proposed method on PASCAL VOC and SVHN. With the proposed method, with small training sets, we achieve a 6.6 points lift of F1 score over the baselines on our video dataset, a 2.9 point lift of F1 score on PASCAL, and a 1.8 points lift of mean Intersection over Union over Grad-CAM for weakly supervised detection on PASCAL. Those improved attention maps may help clinicians better understand vision model predictions and ease the deployment of machine learning systems into clinical care. We share part of the code for this article at the following repository: https://github.com/alimirzazadeh/SemisupervisedAttention."}

MC-SBIG is a challenging task that requires strong prior knowledge due to the significant domain gap between sketches and natural images. Existing learning-based approaches rely on a large-scale paired dataset to learn the mapping between these two image modalities. However, since the public paired sketch-photo data are scarce, it is struggling for learning-based methods to achieve satisfactory results. In this work, we introduce a new approach based on GAN inversion, which can utilize a powerful pretrained generator to facilitate image generation from a given sketch. Our GAN inversion-based method has two advantages: 1. it can freely take advantage of the prior knowledge of a pretrained image generator; 2. it allows the proposed model to focus on learning the mapping from a sketch to a low-dimension latent code, which is a much easier task than directly mapping to a high-dimension natural image. We also present a novel shape loss to improve generation quality further. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that our method can produce sketch-faithful and photo-realistic images and significantly outperform the baseline methods."}

Leveraging the online knowledge distillation framework, we propose the \"FAN-Trans\" method for AU detection. Our model consists of a hybrid network of convolution layers and transformer blocks designed to learn per-AU features and to model AU co-occurrences. The model uses a pre-trained face alignment network as the feature extractor. After further transformation by a small learnable add-on convolutional subnet, the per-AU features are fed into transformer blocks to enhance their representation. As multiple AUs often appear together, we propose a learnable attention drop mechanism in the transformer block to learn the correlation between the features for different AUs. We also design a classifier that predicts AU presence by considering all AUs' features, to explicitly capture label dependencies. Finally, we make the first attempt of adapting online knowledge distillation in the training stage for this task, further improving the model's performance. Experiments on the BP4D and DISFA datasets show our method has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on both, demonstrating its effectiveness."}

Both part segmentation and structure inference have been extensively studied in the recent deep learning literature, while the supervisions used for each task have not been fully exploited to assist the other task. Namely, structure inference has been typically conducted with an autoencoder that does not leverage the point-to-part associations. Also, segmentation has been mostly performed without structural priors that tell the plausibility of the output segments. We present how these two tasks can be best combined while fully utilizing supervision to improve performance. Our framework first decomposes a raw input shape into part segments using an off-the-shelf algorithm, whose outputs are then mapped to nodes in a part hierarchy, establishing point-to-part associations. Following this, ours predicts the structural information, e.g., part bounding boxes and part relationships. Lastly, the segmentation is rectified by examining the confusion of part boundaries using the structure-based part features. Our experimental results based on the StructureNet and PartNet demonstrate that the interplay between the two tasks results in remarkable improvements in both tasks: 27.91% in structure inference and 0.5% in segmentation."}

State-of-art methods rely on multiple independent stages, where initial spatio-temporal proposals are generated using visual and motion cues, and then prominent objects are identified and refined. The localization involves solving an optimization problem over one or more videos, and video tags are typically used for video clustering. This process requires a model per video or per class making for costly inference. Moreover, localized regions are not necessary discriminant because these methods rely on unsupervised motion methods like optical flow, or discarded video tags from optimization. In this paper, we leverage the successful class activation mapping (CAM) methods, designed for WSOL based on still images. A new Temporal CAM (TCAM) method is introduced for training a discriminant deep learning (DL) model to exploit spatio-temporal information in videos, using an CAM-Temporal Max Pooling (CAM-TMP) aggregation mechanism over consecutive CAMs. In particular, activations of regions of interest (ROIs) are collected from CAMs produced by a pretrained CNN classifier, and generate pixel-wise pseudo-labels for training a decoder. In addition, a global unsupervised size constraint, and local constraint such as CRF are used to yield more accurate CAMs. Inference over single independent frames allows parallel processing of a clip of frames, and real-time localization. Extensive experiments on two challenging YouTube-Objects datasets with unconstrained videos indicate that CAM methods (trained on independent frames) can yield decent localization accuracy. Our proposed TCAM method achieves a new state-of-art in WSVOL accuracy, and visual results suggest that it can be adapted for subsequent tasks, such as object detection and tracking."}

And how can we implement this in a practical manner? This paper proposes a training strategy to ConveY Brain Oversight to Raise Generalization (CYBORG). This new approach incorporates human-annotated saliency maps into a loss function that guides the model's learning to focus on image regions that humans deem salient for the task. The Class Activation Mapping (CAM) mechanism is used to probe the model's current saliency in each training batch, juxtapose this model saliency with human saliency, and penalize large differences. Results on the task of synthetic face detection, selected to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach, show that CYBORG leads to significant improvement in accuracy on unseen samples consisting of face images generated from six Generative Adversarial Networks across multiple classification network architectures. We also show that scaling to even seven times the training data, or using non-human-saliency auxiliary information, such as segmentation masks, and standard loss cannot beat the performance of CYBORG-trained models. As a side effect of this work, we observe that the addition of explicit region annotation to the task of synthetic face detection increased human classification accuracy. This work opens a new area of research on how to incorporate human visual saliency into loss functions in practice. All data, code and pre-trained models used in this work are offered with this paper."}

Visual localization algorithms determine the position and orientation from which an image has been captured, using a set of geo-referenced images or a 3D scene representation. Our new localization paradigm, named Implicit Pose Encoding (ImPosing), embeds images and camera poses into a common latent representation with 2 separate neural networks, such that we can compute a similarity score for each image-pose pair. By evaluating candidates through the latent space in a hierarchical manner, the camera position and orientation are not directly regressed but incrementally refined. Very large environments force competitors to store gigabytes of map data, whereas our method is very compact independently of the reference database size. In this paper, we describe how to effectively optimize our learned modules, how to combine them to achieve real-time localization, and demonstrate results on diverse large scale scenarios that significantly outperform prior work in accuracy and computational efficiency."}

We focus on one such representation, scene graphs, and propose a novel scene expansion task where we enrich an input seed graph by adding new nodes (objects) and the corresponding relationships. To this end, we formulate scene graph expansion as a sequential prediction task involving multiple iterations of first predicting a new node and then predicting the set of relationships between the newly predicted node and previously chosen nodes in the graph. We propose and evaluate a sequencing strategy that retains the clustering patterns amongst nodes. In addition, we leverage external knowledge to train our graph generation model, enabling greater generalization of node predictions. Due to the inefficiency of existing maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) based metrics standard for graph generation problems, we design novel metrics that comprehensively evaluate different aspects of node and relation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on Visual Genome and VRD datasets to evaluate the expanded scene graphs using the standard MMD based metrics and our proposed metrics. We observe that the graphs generated by our method, GEMS, better represent the real distribution of the scene graphs compared with baseline methods like GraphRNN."}

In dominant approaches to iris recognition, the size of a ring-shaped iris region is linearly scaled to a canonical rectangle, used further in encoding and matching. However, the biological complexity of the iris sphincter and dilator muscles causes the movements of iris features to be nonlinear in a function of pupil size, and not solely organized along radial paths. Alternatively to the existing theoretical models based on the biomechanics of iris musculature, in this paper we propose a novel deep autoencoder-based model that can effectively learn complex movements of iris texture features directly from the data. The proposed model takes two inputs, (a) an ISO-compliant near-infrared iris image with initial pupil size, and (b) the binary mask defining the target shape of the iris. The model makes all the necessary nonlinear deformations to the iris texture to match the shape of the iris in an image (a) with the shape provided by the target mask (b). The identity-preservation component of the loss function helps the model in finding deformations that preserve identity and not only the visual realism of the generated samples. We also demonstrate two immediate applications of this model: better compensation for iris texture deformations in iris recognition algorithms, compared to linear models, and the creation of a generative algorithm that can aid human forensic examiners, who may need to compare iris images with a large difference in pupil dilation. We offer the source codes and model weights available along with this paper."}

In this work, we focus on a more general and challenging scenario, namely the separation of unknown musical instruments, where the categories in training and testing phases have no overlap with each other. To tackle this new setting, we propose the \"Separation-with-Consistency\" (SeCo) framework, which can accomplish the separation on unknown categories by exploiting the consistency constraints. Furthermore, to capture richer characteristics of the novel melodies, we devise an online matching strategy, which can bring stable enhancements with no cost of extra parameters. Experiments demonstrate that our SeCo framework exhibits strong adaptation ability on the novel musical categories and outperforms the baseline methods by a notable margin."}

However, the cross-modal attention models of existing methods could be sub-optimal and inaccurate because there is no direct supervision provided during the training process. In this work, we propose two novel training strategies, namely Contrastive Content Re-sourcing (CCR) and Contrastive Content Swapping (CCS) constraints, to address such limitations. These constraints supervise the training of cross-modal attention models in a contrastive learning manner without requiring explicit attention annotations. They are plug-in training strategies and can be generally integrated into existing cross-modal attention models. Additionally, we introduce three metrics, including Attention Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, to quantitatively measure the quality of learned attention models. We evaluate the proposed constraints by incorporating them into four state-of-the-art cross-modal attention-based image-text matching models. Experimental results on both Flickr30k and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate that integrating these constraints generally improves the model performance in terms of both retrieval performance and attention metrics."}

Since such a substitution is artificial, without labels for supervised learning, our core contribution is to build a mapping from audio to video that learns from unpaired examples via high-level constraints. For speech, we additionally disentangle content from style, such as gender and dialect. Qualitative and quantitative results, including a human study, demonstrate that our unpaired translation approach maintains important audio features in the generated video and that videos of faces and numbers are well suited for visualizing high-dimensional audio features that can be parsed by humans to match and distinguish between sounds and words.

Since anomalies by definition cannot be learned, their detection must rely on a very accurate \"normality model\". To this aim, we introduce here a global-to-local Gaussian model for neural network features, learned from a set of normal images. This probabilistic model enables unsupervised anomaly detection. A global Gaussian mixture model of the features is first learned using all available features from normal data. This global Gaussian mixture model is then localized by an adaptation of the K-MLE algorithm, which learns a spatial weight map for each Gaussian. These weights are then used instead of the mixture weights to detect anomalies. This method enables precise modeling of complex data, even with limited data. Applied on WideResnet50-2 features, our approach outperforms the previous state of the art on the MVTec dataset, particularly on the object category. It is robust to perturbations that are frequent in production lines, such as imperfect alignment, and is on par in terms of memory and computation time with the previous state of the art."}

Examples of such solutions comprise quantization, i.e. converting the processing values (weights and inputs) from floating point into integers e.g. int8 or int4. Concurrently, the rise of privacy concerns motivated the study of less invasive acceleration methods, such as data-free quantization of pre-trained models weights and activations. Previous approaches either exploit statistical information to deduce scalar ranges and scaling factors for the activations in a static manner, or dynamically adapt this range on-the-fly for each input of each layers (also referred to as activations): the latter generally being more accurate at the expanse of significantly slower inference. In this work, we argue that static input quantization can reach the accuracy levels of dynamic methods by means of a per-channel input quantization scheme that allows one to more finely preserve cross-channel dynamics. We show through a thorough empirical evaluation on multiple computer vision problems (e.g. ImageNet classification, Pascal VOC object detection as well as CityScapes semantic segmentation) that the proposed method, dubbed SPIQ, achieves accuracies rivalling dynamic approaches with static-level inference speed, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art quantization methods on every benchmark."}

Given the need for lowering the time cost of multiple acquisitions, current deep accelerated MRI reconstruction networks focus on exploiting the redundancy between multiple contrasts. However, existing works are largely supervised with paired data and/or prohibitively expensive fully-sampled MRI sequences. Further, reconstruction networks typically rely on convolutional architectures which are limited in their capacity to model long-range interactions and may lead to suboptimal recovery of fine anatomical detail. To these ends, we present a dual-domain self-supervised transformer (DSFormer) for accelerated MC-MRI reconstruction. DSFormer develops a deep conditional cascade transformer (DCCT) consisting of cascaded Swin transformer reconstruction networks (SwinRN) trained under two deep conditioning strategies to enable MC-MRI information sharing. We further use a dual-domain (image and k-space) self-supervised learning strategy for DCCT to alleviate the costs of acquiring fully sampled training data. DSFormer generates high-fidelity reconstructions which outperform current fully-supervised baselines. Moreover, we find that DSFormer achieves nearly the same performance when trained either with full supervision or with the proposed self-supervision."}

To solve these problems, we propose Spatio-TemporAl cRoss (STAR)-transformer, which can effectively represent two cross-modal features as a recognizable vector. First, from the input video and skeleton sequence, video frames are output as global grid tokens and skeletons are output as joint map tokens, respectively. These tokens are then aggregated into multi-class tokens and input into STAR-transformer. The STAR-transformer encoder consists of a full spatio-temporal attention (FAttn) module and a proposed zigzag spatio-temporal attention (ZAttn) module. Similarly, the continuous decoder consists of a FAttn module and a proposed binary spatio-temporal attention (BAttn) module. STAR-transformer learns an efficient multi-feature representation of the spatio-temporal features by properly arranging pairings of the FAttn, ZAttn, and BAttn modules.

Atmospheric turbulence causes significant degradation to image quality by introducing blur and geometric distortion. In recent years, various deep learning-based single image atmospheric turbulence mitigation methods, including CNN-based and GAN inversion-based, have been proposed in the literature which attempt to remove the distortion in the image. However, some of these methods are difficult to train and often fail to reconstruct facial features and produce unrealistic results, especially in the case of high turbulence. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently gained some traction because of their stable training process and their ability to generate high quality images. In this paper, we propose the first DDPM-based solution for the problem of atmospheric turbulence mitigation. We also propose a fast sampling technique for reducing the inference times for conditional DDPMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world data to show the significance of our model.

There are at least three advantages of incorporating decision trees and graphs: they are easy to interpret since they are based on sequential decisions, they can make decisions faster, and they provide a hierarchy of classes. However, one of the well-known drawbacks of decision trees, as compared to decision graphs, is that decision trees cannot reuse the decision nodes. Nevertheless, decision graphs were not commonly used in deep learning due to the lack of efficient gradient-based training techniques. In this paper, we fill this gap and provide a general paradigm based on Markov processes, which allows for efficient training of the special type of decision graphs, which we call Self-Organizing Neural Graphs (SONG). We provide a theoretical study on SONG, complemented by experiments conducted on Letter, Connect4, MNIST, CIFAR, and TinyImageNet datasets, showing that our method performs on par or better than existing decision models."}

Poses are subsequently estimated using the Perspective-n-Points algorithm at runtime. Unfortunately, multi-model formulations are slow and do not scale well with the number of object instances involved. Recent approaches show that direct 6D object pose estimation is feasible when derived from the aforementioned geometric correspondences. We present an approach that learns an intermediate geometric representation of multiple objects to directly regress 6D poses of all instances in a test image. The inherent end-to-end trainability overcomes the requirement of separately processing individual object instances. By calculating the mutual Intersection-over-Unions, pose hypotheses are clustered into distinct instances, which achieves negligible runtime overhead with respect to the number of object instances. Results on multiple challenging standard datasets show that the pose estimation performance is superior to single-model state-of-the-art approaches despite being more than  35 times faster. We additionally provide an analysis showing real-time applicability (>24 fps) for images where more than 90 object instances are present. Further results show the advantage of supervising geometric correspondence-based object pose estimation with the 6D pose."}

However, learning unknown types of anomalies using an unsupervised approach is more practical than a supervised approach as annotation is an extra burden. In this paper, we use isolation tree-based unsupervised clustering to partition the deep feature space of the video segments. The RGB- stream generates a pseudo anomaly score and the flow stream generates a pseudo dynamicity score of a video segment. These scores are then fused using a majority voting scheme to generate preliminary bags of positive and negative segments. However, these bags may not be accurate as the scores are generated only using the current segment which does not represent the global behavior of a typical anomalous event. We then use a refinement strategy based on a cross-branch feed-forward network designed using a popular I3D network to refine both scores. The bags are then refined through a segment re-mapping strategy. The intuition of adding the dynamicity score of a segment with the anomaly score is to enhance the quality of the evidence. The method has been evaluated on three popular video anomaly datasets, i.e., UCF-Crime, CCTV-Fights, and UBI-Fights. Experimental results reveal that the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art video anomaly detection methods."}

While the global perspective effect shown as size and position variations has been exploited for monocular 3D detection extensively, the local perspectives has long been overlooked. We propose a new regression target named keyedge-ratios as the parameterization of the local shape distortion to account for the local perspective, and derive the object depth and yaw angle from it. Theoretically, this approach does not rely on the absolute size or position of the objects in the image, therefore independent of the camera intrinsic parameters. This approach provides a new perspective for monocular 3D reasoning and can be plugged in flexibly to existing monocular 3D object detection frameworks. We demonstrate effectiveness and superior performance over strong baseline methods in multiple datasets."}

In this paper, we discuss the necessity of considering the difference between the feature space and the distribution when performing multimodal learning. We deal with this problem through deep learning and a generative model approach. We introduce a novel network, GAFNet (Global Attention Fourier Net) which learns through large-scale pre-training over three image-text datasets (COCO, SBU, and CC-3M), for achieving high performance on downstream vision and language tasks. We propose a GAF (Global Attention Fourier) module, which integrates multiple modalities into one latent space. GAF module is independent of the type of modality and it allows combining shared representations at each stage. There are various ways of thinking about the relationships between different modalities, which directly affect the model's design. Global attention is not considered as in conventional multimodal learning. A GAF-based model can work for any modality (language, image, audio, category) and is designed to be used for different tasks. In contrast to previous research, our work considers visual grounding as a pretrainable and transferable quality instead of something that must be trained from scratch. Experimental results demonstrate that our technique is competitive and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of popular downstream vision-language tasks, including image generation and image-text retrieval."}

The difficulty of obtaining sufficient training data obstructs the development of video stabilization. In this work, we address this issue by presenting a Sim2RealVS benchmark with more than 1,300 pairs of shaky and stable videos. Our benchmark is curated by an in-game simulator with diverse scenes and various jittering effects. Moreover, we propose a simple yet strong baseline approach, named Motion-Trajectory Smoothing Network (MTSNet), by fully exploiting our Sim2RealVS data. Our MTSNet consists of three main steps: motion estimation, global trajectory smoothing and frame warping. In motion estimation, we design a Motion Correction and Completion (MCC) module to rectify the optical flow with low confidence, such as in textureless regions, thus providing more consistent motion estimation for next steps. Benefiting from our synthetic data, we can explicitly learn a Trajectory Smoothing Transformer (TST) with ground-truth supervision to smooth global trajectories. In training TST, we propose two fully-supervised losses, i.e., a motion magnitude similarity loss and a motion tendency similarity loss. After training, our TST is able to produce smooth motion trajectories for the shaky input videos. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our MTSNet achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real-world data."}

Due to the lack of visual cues, it often becomes difficult to consume the textual information effectively. In this paper, we focus on recipes - a particular type of procedural document and introduce a novel deep-learning driven system - Recipe2Video that automatically converts a recipe document into a multimodal illustrative video. Our method employs novel retrieval and re-ranking methods to select the best set of images and videos that can provide the desired illustration. We formulate a Viterbi-based optimization algorithm to stitch together a coherent video that combines the visual cues, text and voice-over to present an enhanced mode of consumption. We design automated metrics and compare performance across several baselines on two recipe datasets (RecipeQA, Tasty Videos). Our results on downstream tasks and human studies indicate that Recipe2Video captures the semantic and sequential information of the input in the generated video."}

However, data augmentation techniques are limited to the \"seen\" pose combinations and hard to infer poses with rare \"unseen\" joint positions. To address this problem, we present CameraPose, a weakly-supervised framework for 3D human pose estimation from a single image, which can not only be applied on 2D-3D pose pairs but also on 2D alone annotations. By adding a camera parameter branch, any in-the-wild 2D annotations can be fed into our pipeline to boost the training diversity and the 3D poses can be implicitly learned by reprojecting back to 2D. Moreover, CameraPose introduces a refinement network module with confidence-guided loss to further improve the quality of noisy 2D keypoints extracted by 2D pose estimators. Experimental results demonstrate that the CameraPose brings in clear improvements on cross-scenario datasets. Notably, it outperforms the baseline method by 3mm on the most challenging dataset 3DPW. In addition, by combining our proposed refinement network module with existing 3D pose estimators, their performance can be improved in cross-scenario evaluation."}

However, these methods are still limited to either manually added artificial noise or lower denoised audio quality. To overcome these challenges, we collect a large-scale natural noise bird sound dataset. We are the first to transfer the audio denoising problem into an image segmentation problem and propose a deep visual audio denoising (DVAD) model. With a total of 14,120 audio images, we develop an audio ImageMask tool and propose to use a few-shot generalization strategy to label these images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance. We also show that our method can be easily generalized to speech denoising, audio separation, audio enhancement, and noise estimation."}
