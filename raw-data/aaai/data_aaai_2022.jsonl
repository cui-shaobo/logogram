However, neither a virtual environment nor an evaluation platform exists for the overall development of core cognitive skills. We present the VECA(Virtual Environment for Cognitive Assessment), which consists of two main components: (i) a first benchmark to assess the overall cognitive development of an AI agent, and (ii) a novel toolkit to generate diverse and distinct cognitive tasks. VECA benchmark virtually implements the cognitive scale of Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-IV(Bayley-4), the gold-standard developmental assessment for human infants and toddlers. Our VECA toolkit provides a human toddler-like embodied agent with various human-like perceptual features crucial to human cognitive development, e.g., binocular vision, 3D-spatial audio, and tactile receptors. We compare several modern RL algorithms on our VECA benchmark and seek their limitations in modeling human-like cognitive development. We further analyze the validity of the VECA benchmark, as well as the effect of human-like sensory characteristics on cognitive skills."}

To overcome this, we propose a novel framework, dubbed Deep Translation Prior (DTP), to accomplish photorealistic style transfer through test-time training on given input image pair with untrained networks, which learns an image pair-specific translation prior and thus yields better performance and generalization. Tailored for such test-time training for style transfer, we present novel network architectures, with two sub-modules of correspondence and generation modules, and loss functions consisting of contrastive content, style, and cycle consistency losses. Our framework does not require offline training phase for style transfer, which has been one of the main challenges in existing methods, but the networks are to be solely learned during test time. Experimental results prove that our framework has a better generalization ability to unseen image pairs and even outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."}

In this paper, we propose PrivateSNN, which aims to build low-power Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) from a pre-trained ANN model without leaking sensitive information contained in a dataset. Here, we tackle two types of leakage problems: 1) Data leakage is caused when the networks access real training data during an ANN-SNN conversion process. 2) Class leakage is caused when class-related features can be reconstructed from network parameters. In order to address the data leakage issue, we generate synthetic images from the pre-trained ANNs and convert ANNs to SNNs using the generated images. However, converted SNNs remain vulnerable to class leakage since the weight parameters have the same (or scaled) value with respect to ANN parameters. Therefore, we encrypt SNN weights by training SNNs with a temporal spike-based learning rule. Updating weight parameters with temporal data makes SNNs difficult to be interpreted in the spatial domain. We observe that the encrypted PrivateSNN eliminates data and class leakage issues with a slight performance drop (less than ~2%) and significant energy-efficiency gain (about 55x) compared to the standard ANN. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets including  CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet, highlighting the importance of privacy-preserving SNN training."}

To deal with the numerous instances of very small scales, different from the common solution that divides the high-resolution input image into quite a number of chips with low foreground ratios to perform detection on them each, the Unified Foreground Packing (UFP) module is designed, where the sub-regions given by a coarse detector are initially merged through clustering to suppress background and the resulting ones are subsequently packed into a mosaic for a single inference, thus significantly reducing overall time cost. Furthermore, to address the more serious confusion between inter-class similarities and intra-class variations of instances, which deteriorates detection performance but is rarely discussed, the Multi-Proxy Detection Network (MP-Det) is presented to model object distributions in a fine-grained manner by employing multiple proxy learning, and the proxies are enforced to be diverse by minimizing a Bag-of-Instance-Words (BoIW) guided optimal transport loss. By such means, UFPMP-Det largely promotes both the detection accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments are carried out on the widely used VisDrone and UAVDT datasets, and UFPMP-Det reports new state-of-the-art scores at a much higher speed, highlighting its advantages.

In this work, we propose a cooperative multitask learning-based guided multimodal fusion approach, MuMu, to extract robust multimodal representations for human activity recognition (HAR). MuMu employs an auxiliary task learning approach to extract features specific to each set of activities with shared characteristics (activity-group). MuMu then utilizes activity-group-specific features to direct our proposed Guided Multimodal Fusion Approach (GM-Fusion) for extracting complementary multimodal representations, designed as the target task. We evaluated MuMu by comparing its performance to state-of-the-art multimodal HAR approaches on three activity datasets.

Such issues arise from the overfitting issue, which we discover from our own analysis and the previous studies to originate from the frequency-level artifacts in generated images. We find that ignoring the frequency-level artifacts can improve the detector's generalization across various GAN models, but it can reduce the model's performance for the trained GAN models. Thus, we design a framework to generalize the deepfake detector for both the known and unseen GAN models. Our framework generates the frequency-level perturbation maps to make the generated images indistinguishable from the real images. By updating the deepfake detector along with the training of the perturbation generator, our model is trained to detect the frequency-level artifacts at the initial iterations and consider the image-level irregularities at the last iterations. For experiments, we design new test scenarios varying from the training settings in GAN models, color manipulations, and object categories. Numerous experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of our deepfake detector."}

Different from existing methods, which tend to accomplish the relighting task directly, we investigate the intrinsic degradation and relight the low-light image while refining the details and color in two steps. Inspired by the color image formulation (diffuse illumination color plus environment illumination color), we first estimate the degradation from low-light inputs to simulate the distortion of environment illumination color, and then refine the content to recover the loss of diffuse illumination color. To this end, we propose a novel Degradation-to-Refinement Generation Network (DRGN). Its distinctive features can be summarized as 1) A novel two-step generation network for degradation learning and content refinement. It is not only superior to one-step methods, but also capable of synthesizing sufficient paired samples to benefit the model training; 2) A multi-resolution fusion network to represent the target information (degradation or contents) in a multi-scale cooperative manner, which is more effective to address the complex unmixing problems. Extensive experiments on both the enhancement task and the joint detection task have verified the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method, surpassing the SOTA by 1.59dB on average and 3.18% in mAP on the ExDark dataset.

The feature heterogeneity caused by diverse scanners or protocols introduces a drift in the learning process, in both local (client) and global (server) optimizations, which harms the convergence as well as model performance. Many previous works have attempted to address the non-iid issue by tackling the drift locally or globally, but how to jointly solve the two essentially coupled drifts is still unclear. In this work, we concentrate on handling both local and global drifts and introduce a new harmonizing framework called HarmoFL. First, we propose to mitigate the local update drift by normalizing amplitudes of images transformed into the frequency domain to mimic a unified imaging setting, in order to generate a harmonized feature space across local clients. Second, based on harmonized features, we design a client weight perturbation guiding each local model to reach a flat optimum, where a neighborhood area of the local optimal solution has a uniformly low loss. Without any extra communication cost, the perturbation assists the global model to optimize towards a converged optimal solution by aggregating several local flat optima. We have theoretically analyzed the proposed method and empirically conducted extensive experiments on three medical image classification and segmentation tasks, showing that HarmoFL outperforms a set of recent state-of-the-art methods with promising convergence behavior.

To handle this, we propose a new RGB-NIR fusion algorithm called Dark Vision Net (DVN) with two technical novelties: Deep Structure and Deep Inconsistency Prior (DIP). The Deep Structure extracts clear structure details in deep multiscale feature space rather than raw input space, which is more robust to noisy inputs. Based on the deep structures from both RGB and NIR domains, we introduce the DIP to leverage the structure inconsistency to guide the fusion of RGB-NIR. Benefits from this, the proposed DVN obtains high-quality low-light images without the visual artifacts. We also propose a new dataset called Dark Vision Dataset (DVD), consisting of aligned RGB-NIR image pairs, as the first public RGB-NIR fusion benchmark. Quantitative and qualitative results on the proposed benchmark show that DVN significantly outperforms other comparison algorithms in PSNR and SSIM, especially in extremely low light conditions."}

While most pansharpening methods are based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures with standard convolution operations, few attempts have been made with context-adaptive/dynamic convolution, which delivers impressive results on high-level vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to generate local-context adaptive (LCA) convolution kernels and introduce a new global harmonic (GH) bias mechanism, exploiting image local specificity as well as integrating global information, dubbed LAGConv. The proposed LAGConv can replace the standard convolution that is context-agnostic to fully perceive the particularity of each pixel for the task of remote sensing pansharpening. Furthermore, by applying the LAGConv, we provide an image fusion network architecture, which is more effective than conventional CNN-based pansharpening approaches. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by extensive experiments implemented on a wide range of datasets compared with state-of-the-art pansharpening methods. Besides, more discussions testify that the proposed LAGConv outperforms recent adaptive convolution techniques for pansharpening."}

In this work, we present a light-weight matting objective decomposition network (MODNet) for portrait matting in real-time with a single input image. The key idea behind our efficient design is by optimizing a series of sub-objectives simultaneously via explicit constraints. In addition, MODNet includes two novel techniques for improving model efficiency and robustness. First, an Efficient Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (e-ASPP) module is introduced to fuse multi-scale features for semantic estimation. Second, a self-supervised sub-objectives consistency (SOC) strategy is proposed to adapt MODNet to real-world data to address the domain shift problem common to trimap-free methods. MODNet is easy to be trained in an end-to-end manner. It is much faster than contemporaneous methods and runs at 67 frames per second on a 1080Ti GPU.

Known solutions include the enhancement of training data and the increase of rotation invariance by globally merging the rotation equivariant features. These methods either increase the workload of training or increase the number of model parameters. To address this problem, this paper proposes a module that can be inserted into the existing networks, and directly incorporates the rotation invariance into the feature extraction layers of the CNNs. This module does not have learnable parameters and will not increase the complexity of the model. At the same time, only by training the upright data, it can perform well on the rotated testing set. These ad-vantages will be suitable for fields such as biomedicine and astronomy where it is difficult to obtain upright samples or the target has no directionality.

Traditional methods mainly focus on designing the image-level or box-level feature propagation strategies to exploit temporal information. This paper argues that with a more effective and efficient feature propagation framework, video object detectors can gain improvement in terms of both accuracy and speed. For this purpose, this paper studies object-level feature propagation, and proposes an object query propagation (QueryProp) framework for high-performance video object detection. The proposed QueryProp contains two propagation strategies: 1) query propagation is performed from sparse key frames to dense non-key frames to reduce the redundant computation on non-key frames; 2) query propagation is performed from previous key frames to the current key frame to improve feature representation by temporal context modeling. To further facilitate query propagation, an adaptive propagation gate is designed to achieve flexible key frame selection. We conduct extensive experiments on the ImageNet VID dataset. QueryProp achieves comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods and strikes a decent accuracy/speed trade-off."}

Most existing works mainly tackle this problem by reusing the backbone network to extract features of detected discriminative regions. However, this strategy inevitably complicates the pipeline and pushes the proposed regions to contain most parts of the objects thus fails to locate the really important parts. Recently, vision transformer (ViT) shows its strong performance in the traditional classification task. The self-attention mechanism of the transformer links every patch token to the classification token. In this work, we first evaluate the effectiveness of the ViT framework in the fine-grained recognition setting. Then motivated by the strength of the attention link can be intuitively considered as an indicator of the importance of tokens, we further propose a novel Part Selection Module that can be applied to most of the transformer architectures where we integrate all raw attention weights of the transformer into an attention map for guiding the network to effectively and accurately select discriminative image patches and compute their relations. A contrastive loss is applied to enlarge the distance between feature representations of confusing classes. We name the augmented transformer-based model TransFG and demonstrate the value of it by conducting experiments on five popular fine-grained benchmarks where we achieve state-of-the-art performance. Qualitative results are presented for better understanding of our model."}

In contrast to the standard InfoNCE loss, which requires a strict binary separation of the training pairs into similar and dissimilar samples, RINCE can exploit information about a similarity ranking for learning a corresponding embedding space. We show that the proposed loss function learns favorable embeddings compared to the standard InfoNCE whenever at least noisy ranking information can be obtained or when the definition of positives and negatives is blurry. We demonstrate this for a supervised classification task with additional superclass labels and noisy similarity scores. Furthermore, we show that RINCE can also be applied to unsupervised training with experiments on unsupervised representation learning from videos. In particular, the embedding yields higher classification accuracy, retrieval rates and performs better on out-of-distribution detection than the standard InfoNCE loss."}

A heterogeneous graph with the “resolution” attribute is constructed to explicitly model the feature and spatial-scaling relationship of multi-resolution patches. We then design a novel resolution-aware attention convolution (RAConv) block to learn compact yet discriminative representation from the graph, which tackles the heterogeneity of node neighbors with different resolutions and yields more reliable message passing.

Many countermeasures have been proposed to mitigate such risks. Current Deepfake detection methods achieve superior performances in dealing with low-visual-quality Deepfake media which can be distinguished by the obvious visual artifacts. However, with the development of deep generative models, the realism of Deepfake media has been significantly improved and becomes tough challenging to current detection models. In this paper, we propose a frame inference-based detection framework (FInfer) to solve the problem of high-visual-quality Deepfake detection. Specifically, we first learn the referenced representations of the current and future frames’ faces. Then, the current frames’ facial representations are utilized to predict the future frames’ facial representations by using an autoregressive model. Finally, a representation-prediction loss is devised to maximize the discriminability of real videos and fake videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our FInfer framework through information theory analyses. The entropy and mutual information analyses indicate the correlation between the predicted representations and referenced representations in real videos is higher than that of high-visual-quality Deepfake videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance of our method is promising in terms of in-dataset detection performance, detection efficiency, and cross-dataset detection performance in high-visual-quality Deepfake videos."}

However, SOTA dynamic convolution operators are sensitive to input noises (e.g., Gaussian noise, shot noise, e.t.c.) and lack sufficient spatial contextual information in filter generation.  To alleviate this inherent weakness, we propose a lightweight and heterogeneous-structure (i.e., static and dynamic) operator, named Bi-volution.  On the one hand, Bi-volution is designed as a dual-branch structure to fully leverage complementary properties of static/dynamic convolution, which endows Bi-volution more robust properties and higher performance.  On the other hand, the Spatial Augmented Kernel Generation module is proposed to improve the dynamic convolution, realizing the learning of spatial context information with negligible additional computational complexity.  Extensive experiments illustrate that the ResNet-50 equipped with Bi-volution achieves a highly competitive boost in performance (+2.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification, +2.4% box AP and +2.2% mask AP on COCO detection and instance segmentation) while maintaining extremely low FLOPs (i.e., ResNet50@2.7 GFLOPs).

While the former is more computationally efficient, the latter usually provides better detection accuracy. By carefully examining the two-stage approaches, we have found that if appropriately designed, the first stage can produce accurate box regression. In this scenario, the second stage mainly rescores the boxes such that the boxes with better localization get selected. From this observation, we have devised a single-stage anchor-free network that can fulfill these requirements. This network, named AFDetV2, extends the previous work by incorporating a self-calibrated convolution block in the backbone, a keypoint auxiliary supervision, and an IoU prediction branch in the multi-task head. We take a simple product of the predicted IoU score with the classification heatmap to form the final classification confidence. The enhanced backbone strengthens the box localization capability, and the rescoring approach effectively joins the object presence confidence and the box regression accuracy. As a result, the detection accuracy is drastically boosted in the single-stage. To evaluate our approach, we have conducted extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset. We have observed that our AFDetV2 achieves the state-of-the-art results on these two datasets, superior to all the prior arts, including both the single-stage and the two-stage 3D detectors. AFDetV2 won the 1st place in the Real-Time 3D Detection of the Waymo Open Dataset Challenge 2021.

To demonstrate the generality of this single-stage method, we have also applied it to the first stage of the two-stage networks. Without exception, the results show that with the strengthened backbone and the rescoring approach, the second stage refinement is no longer needed."}

To mitigate these threats, recent studies have proposed adversarial watermarks to combat deepfake models, leading them to generate distorted outputs. Despite achieving impressive results, these adversarial watermarks have low image-level and model-level transferability, meaning that they can protect only one facial image from one specific deepfake model. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution that can generate a Cross-Model Universal Adversarial Watermark (CMUA-Watermark), protecting a large number of facial images from multiple deepfake models. Specifically, we begin by proposing a cross-model universal attack pipeline that attacks multiple deepfake models iteratively. Then, we design a two-level perturbation fusion strategy to alleviate the conflict between the adversarial watermarks generated by different facial images and models. Moreover, we address the key problem in cross-model optimization with a heuristic approach to automatically find the suitable attack step sizes for different models, further weakening the model-level conflict. Finally, we introduce a more reasonable and comprehensive evaluation method to fully test the proposed method and compare it with existing ones. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMUA-Watermark can effectively distort the fake facial images generated by multiple deepfake models while achieving a better performance than existing methods.

It remains challenging to restore such degraded images using deep neural networks since real-world paired data is scarcely available while synthetic paired data cannot approximate real-world data perfectly. In this paper, we propose an UnSupervised Underwater Image Restoration method (USUIR) by leveraging the homology property between a raw underwater image and a re-degraded image. Specifically, USUIR first estimates three latent components of the raw underwater image, i.e., the global background light, the transmission map, and the scene radiance (the clean image). Then, a re-degraded image is generated by randomly mixing up the estimated scene radiance and the raw underwater image. We demonstrate that imposing a homology constraint between the raw underwater image and the re-degraded image is equivalent to minimizing the restoration error and hence can be used for the unsupervised restoration. Extensive experiments show that USUIR achieves promising performance in both inference time and restoration quality."}

However, these works impose supervisions on sparsely sampled video frames but overlook the local mo- tions among adjacent frames, which instead encode rich in- consistency information that can serve as an efficient indica- tor for DeepFake video detection. To mitigate this issue, we delves into the local motion and propose a novel sampling unit named snippet which contains a few successive videos frames for local temporal inconsistency learning. Moreover, we elaborately design an Intra-Snippet Inconsistency Module (Intra-SIM) and an Inter-Snippet Interaction Module (Inter- SIM) to establish a dynamic inconsistency modelling frame- work. Specifically, the Intra-SIM applies bi-directional tem- poral difference operations and a learnable convolution ker- nel to mine the short-term motions within each snippet. The Inter-SIM is then devised to promote the cross-snippet infor- mation interaction to form global representations. The Intra- SIM and Inter-SIM work in an alternate manner and can be plugged into existing 2D CNNs. Our method outperforms the state of the art competitors on four popular benchmark dataset, i.e., FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, DFDC and Wild- Deepfake. Besides, extensive experiments and visualizations are also presented to further illustrate its effectiveness."}

How to adapt state-of-the-art object detectors to the few-shot domain remains challenging. Object proposal is a key ingredient in modern object detectors. However, the quality of proposals generated for few-shot classes using existing methods is far worse than that of many-shot classes, e.g., missing boxes for few-shot classes due to misclassification or inaccurate spatial locations with respect to true objects. To address the noisy proposal problem, we propose a novel meta-learning based FSOD model by jointly optimizing the few-shot proposal generation and fine-grained few-shot proposal classification. To improve proposal generation for few-shot classes, we propose to learn a lightweight metric-learning based prototype matching network, instead of the conventional simple linear object/nonobject classifier, e.g., used in RPN. Our non-linear classifier with the feature fusion network could improve the discriminative prototype matching and the proposal recall for few-shot classes. To improve the fine-grained few-shot proposal classification, we propose a novel attentive feature alignment method to address the spatial misalignment between the noisy proposals and few-shot classes, thus improving the performance of few-shot object detection. Meanwhile we learn a separate Faster R-CNN detection head for many-shot base classes and show strong performance of maintaining base-classes knowledge. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple FSOD benchmarks over most of the shots and metrics."}

The dominant paradigms rely on purely CNN-based architectures which often fail in incorporating relations of long-range lane points and global contexts induced by surrounding objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Inspired by recent advances of the transformer encoder-decoder architecture in various vision tasks, we move forwards to design a new end-to-end Laneformer architecture that revolutionizes the conventional transformers into better capturing the shape and semantic characteristics of lanes, with minimal overhead in latency. First, coupling with deformable pixel-wise self-attention in the encoder, Laneformer presents two new row and column self-attention operations to efficiently mine point context along with the lane shapes. Second, motivated by the appearing objects would affect the decision of predicting lane segments, Laneformer further includes the detected object instances as extra inputs of multi-head attention blocks in the encoder and decoder to facilitate the lane point detection by sensing semantic contexts. Specifically, the bounding box locations of objects are added into Key module to provide interaction with each pixel and query while the ROI-aligned features are inserted into Value module. Extensive experiments demonstrate our Laneformer achieves state-of-the-art performances on CULane benchmark, in terms of 77.1% F1 score. We hope our simple and effective Laneformer will serve as a strong baseline for future research in self-attention models for lane detection."}

Based on this system, the structure-from-motion (SfM) technology is used to realize scene reconstruction, but the fixed relative poses between cameras in the multi-camera system are usually not considered. This paper presents a tailor-made multi-camera based motion averaging system, where the fixed relative poses are utilized to improve the accuracy and robustness of SfM. Our approach starts by dividing the images into reference images and non-reference images, and edges in view-graph are divided into four categories accordingly. Then, a multi-camera based rotating averaging problem is formulated and solved in two stages, where an iterative re-weighted least squares scheme is used to deal with outliers. Finally, a multi-camera based translation averaging problem is formulated and a l1-norm based optimization scheme is proposed to compute the relative translations of multi-camera system and reference camera positions simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves superior accuracy and robustness on various data sets compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}

Several prior studies address this issue by expanding the distribution of the limited training data via massive and hand-crafted data augmentation. We handle data-limited image generation from a very different perspective. Specifically, we design GenCo, a Generative Co-training network that mitigates the discriminator over-fitting issue by introducing multiple complementary discriminators that provide diverse supervision from multiple distinctive views in training. We instantiate the idea of GenCo in two ways. The first way is Weight-Discrepancy Co-training (WeCo) which co-trains multiple distinctive discriminators by diversifying their parameters. The second way is Data-Discrepancy Co-training (DaCo) which achieves co-training by feeding discriminators with different views of the input images. Extensive experiments over multiple benchmarks show that GenCo achieves superior generation with limited training data. In addition, GenCo also complements the augmentation approach with consistent and clear performance gains when combined."}

We find that fine-tuning using the recently developed self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, such as SimCLR and MoCo, fails to improve the performance of instance retrieval. In this work, we identify that the learnt representations for instance retrieval should be invariant to large variations in viewpoint and background etc., whereas self-augmented positives applied by the current SSL methods can not provide strong enough signals for learning robust instance-level representations. To overcome this problem, we propose InsCLR, a new SSL method that builds on the instance-level contrast, to learn the intra-class invariance by dynamically mining meaningful pseudo positive samples from both mini-batches and a memory bank during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InsCLR achieves similar or even better performance than the state-of-the-art SSL methods on instance retrieval.

Point cloud-based large scale place recognition is the spine of them. While many models have been proposed and have achieved acceptable performance by learning short-range local features, they always skip long-range contextual properties. Moreover, the model size also becomes a serious shackle for their wide applications. To overcome these challenges, we propose a super light-weight network model termed SVT-Net. On top of the highly efficient 3D Sparse Convolution (SP-Conv), an Atom-based Sparse Voxel Transformer (ASVT) and a Cluster-based Sparse Voxel Transformer (CSVT) are proposed respectively to learn both short-range local features and long-range contextual features. Consisting of ASVT and CSVT, SVT-Net can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of both recognition accuracy and running speed with a super-light model size (0.9M parameters). Meanwhile, for the purpose of further boosting efficiency, we introduce two simplified versions, which also achieve state-of-the-art performance and further reduce the model size to 0.8M and 0.4M respectively."}

A recent class of methods to address this problem uses various ways to construct a new training sample by mixing a pair (or more) of training samples. We propose PatchUp, a hidden state block-level regularization technique for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), that is applied on selected contiguous blocks of feature maps from a random pair of samples. Our approach improves the robustness of CNN models against the manifold intrusion problem that may occur in other state-of-the-art mixing approaches. Moreover, since we are mixing the contiguous block of features in the hidden space, which has more dimensions than the input space, we obtain more diverse samples for training towards different dimensions. Our experiments on CIFAR10/100, SVHN, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet using ResNet architectures including PreActResnet18/34, WRN-28-10, ResNet101/152 models show that PatchUp improves upon, or equals, the performance of current state-of-the-art regularizers for CNNs. We also show that PatchUp can provide a better generalization to deformed samples and is more robust against adversarial attacks."}

Although the global aggregation methods, e. g., PointNet and Deep Sets, get involved in simpler structures, their performance is poorer than the local aggregation ones like PointNet++ and Point Transformer. It remains an open problem whether there exists a global aggregation method with a simple structure, competitive performance, and even much fewer parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel global aggregation permutation-invariant network based on dual MLP dot-product, called DuMLP-Pin, which is capable of being employed to extract features for set inputs, including unordered or unstructured pixel, attribute, and point cloud data sets. We strictly prove that any permutation-invariant function implemented by DuMLP-Pin can be decomposed into two or more permutation-equivariant ones in a dot-product way as the cardinality of the given input set is greater than a threshold. We also show that the DuMLP-Pin can be viewed as Deep Sets with strong constraints under certain conditions. The performance of DuMLP-Pin is evaluated on several different tasks with diverse data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that our DuMLP-Pin achieves the best results on the two classification problems for pixel sets and attribute sets. On both the point cloud classification and the part segmentation, the accuracy of DuMLP-Pin is very close to the so-far best-performing local aggregation method with only a 1-2% difference, while the number of required parameters is significantly reduced by more than 85% in classification and 69% in segmentation, respectively.

It is widely known that CNN is deemed as a 'blackbox', which is hard for understanding the prediction mechanism and debugging the wrong prediction. Some model debugging and explanation works are developed for solving the above drawbacks. However, those methods focus on explanation and diagnosing possible causes for model prediction, based on which the researchers handle the following optimization of models manually. In this paper, we propose the first completely automatic model diagnosing and treating tool, termed as Model Doctor. Based on two discoveries that 1) each category is only correlated with sparse and specific convolution kernels, and 2) adversarial samples are isolated while normal samples are successive in the feature space, a simple aggregate gradient constraint is devised for effectively diagnosing and optimizing CNN classifiers. The aggregate gradient strategy is a versatile module for mainstream CNN classifiers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Model Doctor applies to all existing CNN classifiers, and improves the accuracy of 16 mainstream CNN classifiers by 1%~5%."}

However, the contexts gathered by the previous voxel-based methods decrease when handling sparse point clouds. To address this problem, we propose a multiple-contexts deep learning framework called OctAttention employing the octree structure, a memory-efficient representation for point clouds. Our approach encodes octree symbol sequences in a lossless way by gathering the information of sibling and ancestor nodes. Expressly, we first represent point clouds with octree to reduce spatial redundancy, which is robust for point clouds with different resolutions. We then design a conditional entropy model with a large receptive field that models the sibling and ancestor contexts to exploit the strong dependency among the neighboring nodes and employ an attention mechanism to emphasize the correlated nodes in the context. Furthermore, we introduce a mask operation during training and testing to make a trade-off between encoding time and performance. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art works, our approach obtains a 10%-35% BD-Rate gain on the LiDAR benchmark (e.g. SemanticKITTI) and object point cloud dataset (e.g. MPEG 8i, MVUB), and saves 95% coding time compared to the voxel-based baseline.

However, the recognition of low-resolution scene text images remains a challenge. Even though some super-resolution methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, they usually treat text images as general images while ignoring the fact that the visual quality of strokes (the atomic unit of text) plays an essential role for text recognition. According to Gestalt Psychology, humans are capable of composing parts of details into the most similar objects guided by prior knowledge. Likewise, when humans observe a low-resolution text image, they will inherently use partial stroke-level details to recover the appearance of holistic characters. Inspired by Gestalt Psychology, we put forward a Stroke-Aware Scene Text Image Super-Resolution method containing a Stroke-Focused Module (SFM) to concentrate on stroke-level internal structures of characters in text images. Specifically, we attempt to design rules for decomposing English characters and digits at stroke-level, then pre-train a text recognizer to provide stroke-level attention maps as positional clues with the purpose of controlling the consistency between the generated super-resolution image and high-resolution ground truth. The extensive experimental results validate that the proposed method can indeed generate more distinguishable images on TextZoom and manually constructed Chinese character dataset Degraded-IC13. Furthermore, since the proposed SFM is only used to provide stroke-level guidance when training, it will not bring any time overhead during the test phase.

However, the output event stream of existing DVS inevitably contains background activity noise (BA noise) due to dark current and junction leakage current, which will affect the temporal correlation of objects, resulting in deteriorated motion estimation performance. Particularly, the existing filter-based denoising methods cannot be directly applied to suppress the noise in event stream, since there is no spatial correlation. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel progressive framework, in which a Motion Estimation (ME) module and an Event Denoising (ED) module are jointly optimized in a mutually reinforced manner. Specifically, based on the maximum sharpness criterion, ME module divides the input event into several segments by adaptive clustering in a motion compensating warp field, and captures the temporal correlation of event stream according to the clustered motion parameters. Taking temporal correlation as guidance, ED module calculates the confidence that each event belongs to real activity events, and transmits it to ME module to update energy function of motion segmentation for noise suppression. The two steps are iteratively updated until stable motion segmentation results are obtained. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approaches against the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods."}

Data augmentation has been the major approach in improving the robustness against common corruptions. However, the samples produced by popular augmentation strategies deviate significantly from the underlying data manifold. As a result, performance is skewed toward certain types of corruption. To address this issue, we propose a multi-source vicinal transfer augmentation (VITA) method for generating diverse on-manifold samples. The proposed VITA consists of two complementary parts: tangent transfer and integration of multi-source vicinal samples. The tangent transfer creates initial augmented samples for improving corruption robustness. The integration employs a generative model to characterize the underlying manifold built by vicinal samples, facilitating the generation of on-manifold samples. Our proposed VITA significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art augmentation methods, demonstrated in extensive experiments on corruption benchmarks."}

Semantic knowledge is learned from attribute descriptions shared between different classes, which are strong prior for localization of object attribute for representing discriminative region features enabling significant visual-semantic interaction. Although few attention-based models have attempted to learn such region features in a single image, the transferability and discriminative attribute localization of visual features are typically neglected. In this paper, we propose an attribute-guided Transformer network to learn the attribute localization for discriminative visual-semantic embedding representations in ZSL, termed TransZero. Specifically, TransZero takes a feature augmentation encoder to alleviate the cross-dataset bias between ImageNet and ZSL benchmarks and improve the transferability of visual features by reducing the entangled relative geometry relationships among region features. To learn locality-augmented visual features, TransZero employs a visual-semantic decoder to localize the most relevant image regions to each attributes from a given image under the guidance of attribute semantic information. Then, the locality-augmented visual features and semantic vectors are used for conducting effective visual-semantic interaction in a visual-semantic embedding network. Extensive experiments show that TransZero achieves a new state-of-the-art on three ZSL benchmarks. The codes are available at: https://github.com/shiming-chen/TransZero."}

Although several methods have been proposed to achieve state-of-the-art performance on this topic, re-identifying vehicle in foggy scenes remains a great challenge due to the degradation of visibility. To our knowledge, this problem is still not well-addressed so far. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose a novel training framework called Semi-supervised Joint Defogging Learning (SJDL) framework. First, the fog removal branch and the re-identification branch are integrated to perform simultaneous training. With the collaborative training scheme, defogged features generated by the defogging branch from input images can be shared to learn better representation for the re-identification branch. However, since the fog-free image of real-world data is intractable, this architecture can only be trained on the synthetic data, which may cause the domain gap problem between real-world and synthetic scenarios. To solve this problem, we design a semi-supervised defogging training scheme that can train two kinds of data alternatively in each iteration. Due to the lack of a dataset specialized for vehicle ReID in the foggy weather, we construct a dataset called FVRID which consists of real-world and synthetic foggy images to train and evaluate the performance.

A key issue is that the samples in tail categories fail to depict their intra-class diversity. Humans can imagine a sample in new poses, scenes and view angles with their prior knowledge even if it is the first time to see this category. Inspired by this, we propose a novel reasoning-based implicit semantic data augmentation method to borrow transformation directions from other classes. Since the covariance matrix of each category represents the feature transformation directions, we can sample new directions from similar categories to generate definitely different instances. Specifically, the long-tailed distributed data is first adopted to train a backbone and a classifier. Then, a covariance matrix for each category is estimated, and a knowledge graph is constructed to store the relations of any two categories. Finally, tail samples are adaptively enhanced via propagating information from all the similar categories in the knowledge graph.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework built upon the transformer, termed LCTR (Local Continuity TRansformer), which targets at enhancing the local perception capability of global features among long-range feature dependencies. To this end, we propose a relational patch-attention module (RPAM), which considers cross-patch information on a global basis.

Different from common domain adaption methods, we propose a domain generalization method to improve the cross-domain performance without touching target samples. The domain generalization is realized by gaze feature purification. We eliminate gaze-irrelevant factors such as illumination and identity to improve the cross-domain performance. We design a plug-and-play self-adversarial framework for the gaze feature purification.

We explore transfer learning capability in KD to enable a student network to learn discriminative features from low-quality images effectively. In particular, we propose the Attention-based Deepfake detection Distiller (ADD), which consists of two novel distillations: 1) frequency attention distillation that effectively retrieves the removed high-frequency components in the student network, and 2) multi-view attention distillation that creates multiple attention vectors by slicing the teacher’s and student’s tensors under different views to transfer the teacher tensor’s distribution to the student more efficiently.

In this paper, we discuss a promising solution to the Open-set Long-Tailed Recognition (OLTR) task utilizing metric learning. Firstly, we propose a distribution-sensitive loss, which weighs more on the tail classes to decrease the intra-class distance in the feature space. Building upon these concentrated feature clusters, a local-density-based metric is introduced, called Localizing Unfamiliarity Near Acquaintance (LUNA), to measure the novelty of a testing sample. LUNA is flexible with different cluster sizes and is reliable on the cluster boundary by considering neighbors of different properties. Moreover, contrary to most of the existing works that alleviate the open-set detection as a simple binary decision, LUNA is a quantitative measurement with interpretable meanings.

However, due to the wide luminance distribution of high dynamic range (HDR) images and the lack of large standard datasets, developing a deep model for HDR image compression is much more challenging. To tackle this issue, we view HDR data as distributional shifts of SDR data and the HDR image compression can be modeled as an out-of-distribution generalization (OoD) problem. Herein, we propose a novel out-of-distribution (OoD) HDR image compression framework (OoDHDR-codec). It learns the general representation across HDR and SDR environments, and allows the model to be trained effectively using a large set of SDR datases supplemented with much fewer HDR samples. Specifically, OoDHDR-codec consists of two branches to process the data from two environments. The SDR branch is a standard blackbox network. For the HDR branch, we develop a hybrid system that models luminance masking and tone mapping with white-box modules and performs content compression with black-box neural networks. To improve the generalization from SDR training data on HDR data, we introduce an invariance regularization term to learn the common representation for both SDR and HDR compression. Extensive experimental results show that the OoDHDR codec achieves strong competitive in-distribution performance and state-of-the-art OoD performance. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach is the first work to model HDR compression as OoD generalization problems and our OoD generalization algorithmic framework can be applied to any deep compression model in addition to the network architectural choice demonstrated in the paper.

These network architectures always lack sufficient interpretability, which limits further performance improvements. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel deep network for pansharpening by combining the model-based methodology with the deep learning method. Firstly, we build an observation model for pansharpening using the convolutional sparse coding (CSC) technique and design a proximal gradient algorithm to solve this model. Secondly, we unfold the iterative algorithm into a deep network, dubbed as Proximal PanNet, by learning the proximal operators using convolutional neural networks. Finally, all the learnable modules can be automatically learned in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on some benchmark datasets show that our network performs better than other advanced methods both quantitatively and qualitatively."}

However, it has relatively lower detection performance on small objects and suffers from slow convergence. This paper observed that DETR performs surprisingly well even on small objects when measuring Average Precision (AP) at decreased Intersection-over-Union (IoU) thresholds. Motivated by this observation, we propose a simple way to improve DETR by refining the coarse features and predicted locations. Specifically, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine (CF) decoder layer constituted of a coarse layer and a carefully designed fine layer. Within each CF decoder layer, the extracted local information (region of interest feature) is introduced into the flow of global context information from the coarse layer to refine and enrich the object query features via the fine layer. In the fine layer, the multi-scale information can be fully explored and exploited via the Adaptive Scale Fusion(ASF) module and Local Cross-Attention (LCA) module. The multi-scale information can also be enhanced by another proposed Transformer Enhanced FPN (TEF) module to further improve the performance. With our proposed framework (named CF-DETR), the localization accuracy of objects (especially for small objects) can be largely improved. As a byproduct, the slow convergence issue of DETR can also be addressed. The effectiveness of CF-DETR is validated via extensive experiments on the coco benchmark. CF-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance among end-to-end detectors, e.g., achieving 47.8 AP using ResNet-50 with 36 epochs in the standard 3x training schedule."}

That is, a CNN has an inductive bias to naturally focus on objects, named as Tobias (\"The object is at sight\") in this paper. This empirical inductive bias is further analyzed and successfully applied to self-supervised learning (SSL). A CNN is encouraged to learn representations that focus on the foreground object, by transforming every image into various versions with different backgrounds, where the foreground and background separation is guided by Tobias. Experimental results show that the proposed Tobias significantly improves downstream tasks, especially for object detection. This paper also shows that Tobias has consistent improvements on training sets of different sizes, and is more resilient to changes in image augmentations."}

However, current SGG methods usually suffer from sub-optimal scene graph generation because of the long-tailed distribution of training data. To address this problem, we propose Resistance Training using Prior Bias (RTPB) for the scene graph generation. Specifically, RTPB uses a distributed-based prior bias to improve models' detecting ability on less frequent relationships during training, thus improving the model generalizability on tail categories. In addition, to further explore the contextual information of objects and relationships, we design a contextual encoding backbone network, termed as Dual Transformer (DTrans). We perform extensive experiments on a very popular benchmark, VG150, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the unbiased scene graph generation. In specific, our RTPB achieves an improvement of over 10% under the mean recall when applied to current SGG methods.

We observe that the prevailing set abstraction design for down-sampling points may maintain too much unimportant background information that can affect feature learning for detecting objects. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel set abstraction method named Semantics-Augmented Set Abstraction (SASA). Technically, we first add a binary segmentation module as the side output to help identify foreground points. Based on the estimated point-wise foreground scores, we then propose a semantics-guided point sampling algorithm to help retain more important foreground points during down-sampling. In practice, SASA shows to be effective in identifying valuable points related to foreground objects and improving feature learning for point-based 3D detection. Additionally, it is an easy-to-plug-in module and able to boost various point-based detectors, including single-stage and two-stage ones. Extensive experiments on the popular KITTI and nuScenes datasets validate the superiority of SASA, lifting point-based detection models to reach comparable performance to state-of-the-art voxel-based methods.

The current method based on boundary matching enumerates and calculates all possible boundary matchings to generate proposals. However, these methods neglect the long-range context aggregation in boundary prediction. At the same time, due to the similar semantics of adjacent matchings, local semantic aggregation of densely-generated matchings cannot improve semantic richness and discrimination. In this paper, we propose the end-to-end proposal generation method named Dual Context Aggregation Network (DCAN) to aggregate context on two levels, namely, boundary level and proposal level, for generating high-quality action proposals, thereby improving the performance of temporal action detection. Specifically, we design the Multi-Path Temporal Context Aggregation (MTCA) to achieve smooth context aggregation on boundary level and precise evaluation of boundaries. For matching evaluation, Coarse-to-fine Matching (CFM) is designed to aggregate context on the proposal level and refine the matching map from coarse to fine. We conduct extensive experiments on ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS-14. DCAN obtains an average mAP of 35.39% on ActivityNet v1.3 and reaches mAP 54.14% at IoU@0.5 on THUMOS-14, which demonstrates DCAN can generate high-quality proposals and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Given a video stream of point cloud observation of an articulated body under arbitrary motion, our approach discovers the unknown low-dimensional skeletal relationship that can effectively represent the movement. Then the discovered structure is utilized to encode the motion priors of dynamic sequences in a latent structure, which can be decoded to the relative joint rotations to represent the full skeletal motion. Our approach works without any prior knowledge of the underlying motion or skeletal structure, and we demonstrate that the discovered structure is even comparable to the hand-labeled ground truth skeleton in representing a 4D sequence of motion. The skeletal structure embeds the general semantics of possible motion space that can generate motions for diverse scenarios. We verify that the learned motion prior is generalizable to the multi-modal sequence generation, interpolation of two poses, and motion retargeting to a different skeletal structure."}

However, such generation systems often suffer from problems of hallucinated facts, and are not inherently designed to incorporate useful external information. Grounded generation models appear to offer remedies, but their training typically relies on rarely-available parallel data where information-relevant documents are provided for context. We propose a framework that alleviates this data constraint by jointly training a grounded generator and document retriever on the language model signal. The model learns to reward retrieval of the documents with the highest utility in generation, and attentively combines them using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) ensemble to generate follow-on text.  We demonstrate that both generator and retriever can take advantage of this joint training and work synergistically to produce more informative and relevant text in both prose and dialogue generation."}

Existing methods mostly focus on either extractive or abstractive summarization and rely on the presence and quality of image captions to build image references. We are the first to propose a Unified framework for Multimodal Summarization grounding on BART, UniMS, that integrates extractive and abstractive objectives, as well as selecting the image output. Specially, we adopt knowledge distillation from a vision-language pretrained model to improve image selection, which avoids any requirement on the existence and quality of image captions. Besides, we introduce a visual guided decoder to better integrate textual and visual modalities in guiding abstractive text generation. Results show that our best model achieves a new state-of-the-art result on a large-scale benchmark dataset. The newly involved extractive objective as well as the knowledge distillation technique are proven to bring a noticeable improvement to the multimodal summarization task."}

Existing research mainly focuses on short dialogue scenarios in a one-on-one fashion. However, multi-person interactions in the real world, such as meetings or interviews, are frequently over a few thousand words. There is still a lack of corresponding research and powerful tools to understand and process such long dialogues. Therefore, in this work, we present a pre-training framework for long dialogue understanding and summarization. Considering the nature of long conversations, we propose a window-based denoising approach for generative pre-training. For a dialogue, it corrupts a window of text with dialogue-inspired noise, and guides the model to reconstruct this window based on the content of the remaining conversation. Furthermore, to process longer input, we augment the model with sparse attention which is combined with conventional attention in a hybrid manner. We conduct extensive experiments on five datasets of long dialogues, covering tasks of dialogue summarization, abstractive question answering and topic segmentation. Experimentally, we show that our pre-trained model DialogLM significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art models across datasets and tasks.

With large quantities of parameters, PLMs are computation-intensive and resource-hungry. Hence, model pruning has been introduced to compress large-scale PLMs.   However, most prior approaches only consider task-specific knowledge towards downstream tasks, but ignore the essential task-agnostic knowledge during pruning, which may cause catastrophic forgetting problem and lead to poor generalization ability.   To maintain both task-agnostic and task-specific knowledge in our pruned model, we propose ContrAstive Pruning (CAP) under the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning.   It is designed as a general framework, compatible with both structured and unstructured pruning.   Unified in contrastive learn- ing, CAP enables the pruned model to learn from the pre-trained model for task-agnostic knowledge, and fine-tuned model for task-specific knowledge.   Besides, to better retain the performance of the pruned model, the snapshots (i.e., the intermediate models at each pruning iteration) also serve as effective supervisions for pruning.   Our extensive experiments show that adopting CAP consistently yields significant improvements, especially in extremely high sparsity scenarios.   With only 3% model parameters reserved (i.e., 97% sparsity), CAP successfully achieves 99.2% and 96.3% of the original BERT performance in QQP and MNLI tasks.   In addition, our probing experiments demonstrate that the model pruned by CAP tends to achieve better generalization ability."}

Most data augmentations in language model pre-training are context-independent. A seminal contextualized augmentation was recently proposed in ELECTRA and achieved state-of-the-art performance by introducing an auxiliary generation network (generator) to produce contextualized data augmentation for the training of a main discrimination network (discriminator). This design, however, introduces extra computation cost of the generator and a need to adjust the relative capability between the generator and the discriminator. In this paper, we propose a self-augmentation strategy (SAS) where a single network is utilized for both regular pre-training and contextualized data augmentation for the training in later epochs. Essentially, this strategy eliminates a separate generator and uses the single network to jointly conduct two pre-training tasks with MLM (Masked Language Modeling) and RTD (Replaced Token Detection) heads. It avoids the challenge to search for an appropriate size of the generator, which is critical to the performance as evidenced in ELECTRA and its subsequent variant models. In addition, SAS is a general strategy that can be seamlessly combined with many new techniques emerging recently or in the future, such as the disentangled attention mechanism from DeBERTa. Our experiments show that SAS is able to outperform ELECTRA and other state-of-the-art models in the GLUE tasks with similar or less computation cost."}

The knowledge module and language module provide essential information to mutually assist each other: the knowledge module produces embeddings for entities in text while the language module generates context-aware initial embeddings for entities and relations in the graph. Our design enables the pre-trained model to easily adapt to unseen knowledge graphs in new domains.

As a result, neural conversational agents with empathetic responding and distress management capabilities have recently gained popularity. However, existing end-to-end empathetic conversational agents often generate generic and repetitive empathetic statements such as \"I am sorry to hear that\", which fail to convey specificity to a given situation. Due to the lack of controllability in such models, they also impose the risk of generating toxic responses. Chatbots leveraging reasoning over knowledge graphs is seen as an efficient and fail-safe solution over end-to-end models. However, such resources are limited in the context of emotional distress. To address this, we introduce HEAL, a knowledge graph developed based on 1M distress narratives and their corresponding consoling responses curated from Reddit. It consists of 22K nodes identifying different types of stressors, speaker expectations, responses, and feedback types associated with distress dialogues and forms 104K connections between different types of nodes.

Despite the widespread use of contextualizing language models (LMs), researchers have no intrinsic evaluation task for understanding the semantic quality of CWEs and their unique properties as related to contextualization, the change in the vector representation of a word based on surrounding words; tokenization, the breaking of uncommon words into subcomponents; and LM-specific geometry learned during training. VAST uses valence, the association of a word with pleasantness, to measure the correspondence of word-level LM semantics with widely used human judgments, and examines the effects of contextualization, tokenization, and LM-specific geometry. Because prior research has found that CWEs from OpenAI's 2019 English-language causal LM GPT-2 perform poorly on other intrinsic evaluations, we select GPT-2 as our primary subject, and include results showing that VAST is useful for 7 other LMs, and can be used in 7 languages. GPT-2 results show that the semantics of a word are more similar to the semantics of context in layers closer to model output, such that VAST scores diverge between our contextual settings, ranging from Pearson’s rho of .55 to .77 in layer 11. We also show that multiply tokenized words are not semantically encoded until layer 8, where they achieve Pearson’s rho of .46, indicating the presence of an encoding process for multiply tokenized words which differs from that of singly tokenized words, for which rho is highest in layer 0. We find that a few neurons with values having greater magnitude than the rest mask word-level semantics in GPT-2’s top layer, but that word-level semantics can be recovered by nullifying non-semantic principal components: Pearson’s rho in the top layer improves from .32 to .76. Downstream POS tagging and sentence classification experiments indicate that the GPT-2 uses these principal components for non-semantic purposes, such as to represent sentence-level syntax relevant to next-word prediction. After isolating semantics, we show the utility of VAST for understanding LM semantics via improvements over related work on four word similarity tasks, with a score of .50 on SimLex-999, better than the previous best of .45 for GPT-2. Finally, we show that 8 of 10 WEAT bias tests, which compare differences in word embedding associations between groups of words, exhibit more stereotype-congruent biases after isolating semantics, indicating that non-semantic structures in LMs also mask social biases."}

It typically requires incorporation of an external knowledge base (KB) and capture of the intrinsic semantics of the dialog history. Recent research shows promising results by using Sequence-to-Sequence models, Memory Networks, and even Graph Convolutional Networks. However, current state-of-the-art models are less effective at integrating dialog history and KB into task-oriented dialog systems in the following ways: 1. The KB representation is not fully context-aware. The dynamic interaction between the dialog history and KB is seldom explored. 2. Both the sequential and structural information in the dialog history can contribute to capturing the dialog semantics, but they are not studied concurrently. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Memory Network (GMN) based Seq2Seq model, GraphMemDialog, to effectively learn the inherent structural information hidden in dialog history, and to model the dynamic interaction between dialog history and KBs. We adopt a modified graph attention network to learn the rich structural representation of the dialog history, whereas the context-aware representation of KB entities are learnt by our novel GMN. To fully exploit this dynamic interaction, we design a learnable memory controller coupled with external KB entity memories to recurrently incorporate dialog history context into KB entities through a multi-hop reasoning mechanism. Experiments on three public datasets show that our GraphMemDialog model achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms strong baselines by a large margin, especially on datatests with more complicated KB information."}

In this work, we investigate a novel solution by revisiting the transition architecture, and augmenting it with a pointer network (PointNet). The framework parses out all opinion structures in linear-time complexity, meanwhile breaks through the limitation of any length of terms with PointNet. To achieve the explicit opinion-role interactions, we further propose a unified dependency-opinion graph (UDOG), co-modeling the syntactic dependency structure and the partial opinion-role structure. We then devise a relation-centered graph aggregator (RCGA) to encode the multi-relational UDOG, where the resulting high-order representations are used to promote the predictions in the vanilla transition system.

Compared to a supervised baseline, our proposed method shows better toxicity reduction with good generation quality in the generated content under multiple settings.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for stance detection.  Our framework is unsupervised and domain-independent. Given a claim and a multi-participant discussion -- we construct the interaction network from which we derive topological embedding for each speaker. These speaker embedding enjoy the following property:  speakers with the same stance tend to be represented by similar vectors, while antipodal vectors represent speakers with opposing stances. These embedding are then used to divide the speakers into stance-partitions. We evaluate our method on three different datasets from different platforms. Our method outperforms or is comparable with supervised models while providing confidence levels for its output. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the structural embedding relate to the valence expressed by the speakers. Finally, we discuss some limitations inherent to the framework."}

However, value-driven chatbots are still understudied in the area of dialogue systems. Most existing datasets focus on commonsense reasoning or social norm modeling. In this work, we present a new large-scale human value dataset called ValueNet, which contains human attitudes on 21,374 text scenarios. The dataset is organized in ten dimensions that conform to the basic human value theory in intercultural research. We further develop a Transformer-based value regression model on ValueNet to learn the utility distribution. Comprehensive empirical results show that the learned value model could benefit a wide range of dialogue tasks. For example, by teaching a generative agent with reinforcement learning and the rewards from the value model, our method attains state-of-the-art performance on the personalized dialog generation dataset: Persona-Chat. With values as additional features, existing emotion recognition models enable capturing rich human emotions in the context, which further improves the empathetic response generation performance in the EmpatheticDialogues dataset. To the best of our knowledge, ValueNet is the first large-scale text dataset for human value modeling, and we are the first one trying to incorporate a value model into emotionally intelligent dialogue systems.

However, QA using images is often limited to just picking the answer from a pre-defined set of options. In addition, images in the real world, especially in news, have objects that are co-referential to the text, with complementary information from both modalities. In this paper, we present a new QA evaluation benchmark with 1,384 questions over news articles that require cross-media grounding of objects in images onto text. Specifically, the task involves multi-hop questions that require reasoning over image-caption pairs to identify the grounded visual object being referred to and then predicting a span from the news body text to answer the question. In addition, we introduce a novel multimedia data augmentation framework, based on cross-media knowledge extraction and synthetic question-answer generation, to automatically augment data that can provide weak supervision for this task. We evaluate both pipeline-based and end-to-end pretraining-based multimedia QA models on our benchmark, and show that they achieve promising performance, while considerably lagging behind human performance hence leaving large room for future work on this challenging new task."}

Some of the best performing single-channel source separation methods utilize downsampling to either make the separation process faster or make the neural networks bigger and increase accuracy. The problem concerning downsampling is that it usually results in information loss. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing SFSRNet which contains a super-resolution (SR) network. The SR network is trained to reconstruct the missing information in the upper frequencies of the audio signal by operating on the spectrograms of the output audio source estimations and the input audio mixture. Any separation method where the length of the sequence is a bottleneck in speed and memory can be made faster or more accurate by using the SR network. Based on the WSJ0-2mix benchmark where estimations of the audio signal of two speakers need to be extracted from the mixture, in our experiments our proposed SFSRNet reaches a scale-invariant signal-to-noise-ratio improvement (SI-SNRi) of 24.0 dB outperforming the state-of-the-art solution SepFormer which reaches an SI-SNRi of 22.3 dB."}

Previous approaches on this topic mainly focus on detecting and utilizing the user’s emotion for generating empathetic responses. However, since empathy includes both aspects of affection and cognition, we argue that in addition to identifying the user’s emotion, cognitive understanding of the user’s situation should also be considered. To this end, we propose a novel approach for empathetic response generation, which leverages commonsense to draw more information about the user’s situation and uses this additional information to further enhance the empathy expression in generated responses. We evaluate our approach on EMPATHETICDIALOGUES, which is a widely-used benchmark dataset for empathetic response generation. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline models in both automatic and human evaluations and can generate more informative and empathetic responses.

Nonetheless, most tasks in this field focus on end-to-end applications without providing insights on whether it is the underlying semantics of visual objects or words that is captured. In this paper we draw on the established Definition Modeling paradigm and enhance it by grounding, for the first time, textual definitions to visual representations. We name this new task Visual Definition Modeling and put forward DEMETER and DIONYSUS, two benchmarks where, given an image as context, models have to generate a textual definition for a target being either i) a word that describes the image, or ii) an object patch therein. To measure the difficulty of our tasks we finetuned six different baselines and analyzed their performances, which show that a text-only encoder-decoder model is more effective than models pretrained for handling inputs of both modalities concurrently. This demonstrates the complexity of our benchmarks and encourages more research on text generation conditioned on multimodal inputs. The datasets for both benchmarks are available at https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/visual-definition-modeling as well as the code to reproduce our models."}

Existing approaches usually decompose the joint extraction task into several basic modules or processing steps to make it easy to conduct. However, such a paradigm ignores the fact that the three elements of a triple are interdependent and indivisible. Therefore, previous joint methods suffer from the problems of cascading errors and redundant information. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel joint entity and relation extraction model, named OneRel, which casts joint extraction as a fine-grained triple classification problem. Specifically, our model consists of a scoring-based classifier and a relation-specific horns tagging strategy. The former evaluates whether a token pair and a relation belong to a factual triple. The latter ensures a simple but effective decoding process. Extensive experimental results on two widely used datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines, and delivers consistent performance gain on complex scenarios of various overlapping patterns and multiple triples."}

However, current adversarial training methods have two principal problems: worse model generalization and ineffective defending against other text attacks. In this paper, we propose a Keyword-bias-aware Adversarial Text Generation model (KATG) that implicitly generates adversarial sentences using a generator-discriminator structure. Instead of using a benign sentence to generate an adversarial sentence, the KATG model utilizes extra multiple benign sentences (namely prior sentences) to guide adversarial sentence generation. Furthermore, to cover more perturbation used in existing attacks, a keyword-bias-aware sampling is proposed to select sentences containing biased words as prior sentences. Besides, to effectively utilize prior sentences, a generative flow mechanism is proposed to construct latent semantic space and learn a latent representation for the prior sentences. Experiments demonstrate that adversarial sentences generated by our KATG model can strengthen the victim model's robustness and generalization."}

In this paper, we present a new Question-Answering dataset called StepGame for robust multi-step spatial reasoning in texts. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art models on the bAbI dataset struggle on the StepGame dataset.

Recently, it has been shown that there also exist input-agnostic attacks in NLP models, called universal adversarial triggers. However, existing methods to craft universal triggers are data intensive. They require large amounts of data samples to generate adversarial triggers, which are typically inaccessible by attackers. For instance, previous works take 3000 data samples per class for the SNLI dataset to generate adversarial triggers. In this paper, we present a novel data-free approach, MINIMAL, to mine input-agnostic adversarial triggers from models. Using the triggers produced with our data-free algorithm, we reduce the accuracy of Stanford Sentiment Treebank’s positive class from 93.6% to 9.6%. Similarly, for the Stanford Natural LanguageInference (SNLI), our single-word trigger reduces the accuracy of the entailment class from 90.95% to less than 0.6%.

Previous singing acoustic models adopt a simple loss (e.g., L1 and L2) or generative adversarial network (GAN) to reconstruct the acoustic features, while they suffer from over-smoothing and unstable training issues respectively, which hinder the naturalness of synthesized singing.  In this work, we propose DiffSinger, an acoustic model for SVS based on the diffusion probabilistic model. DiffSinger is a parameterized Markov chain that iteratively converts the noise into mel-spectrogram conditioned on the music score. By implicitly optimizing variational bound, DiffSinger can be stably trained and generate realistic outputs.  To further improve the voice quality and speed up inference, we introduce a shallow diffusion mechanism to make better use of the prior knowledge learned by the simple loss. Specifically, DiffSinger starts generation at a shallow step smaller than the total number of diffusion steps, according to the intersection of the diffusion trajectories of the ground-truth mel-spectrogram and the one predicted by a simple mel-spectrogram decoder. Besides, we propose boundary prediction methods to locate the intersection and determine the shallow step adaptively. The evaluations conducted on a Chinese singing dataset demonstrate that DiffSinger outperforms state-of-the-art SVS work. Extensional experiments also prove the generalization of our methods on text-to-speech task (DiffSpeech). Audio samples: https://diffsinger.github.io.

However, existing models cannot perform as well as humans, since sentences they produce are often implausible and grammatically incorrect. In this paper, inspired by the process of humans creating sentences, we propose a novel Knowledge-enhanced Commonsense Generation framework, termed KGR4, consisting of four stages: Retrieval, Retrospect, Refine, Rethink. Under this framework, we first perform retrieval to search for relevant sentences from external corpus as the prototypes. Then, we train the generator that either edits or copies these prototypes to generate candidate sentences, of which potential errors will be fixed by an autoencoder-based refiner. Finally, we select the output sentence from candidate sentences produced by generators with different hyper-parameters. Experimental results and in-depth analysis on the CommonGen benchmark strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Particularly, KGR4 obtains 33.56 SPICE in the official leaderboard, outperforming the previously-reported best result by 2.49 SPICE and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

We show that this notion is problematic in the context of NLP as it considers a narrow spectrum of linguistic phenomena. In this paper, we argue for semantic robustness, which is better aligned with the human concept of linguistic fidelity. We characterize semantic robustness in terms of biases that it is expected to induce in a model. We study semantic robustness of a range of vanilla and robustly trained architectures using a template-based generative test bed. We complement the analysis with empirical evidence that, despite being harder to implement, semantic robustness can improve performance %gives guarantees for on complex linguistic phenomena where models robust in the classical sense fail."}

Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown promising results for few-shot learning in ToD. To better utilize the power of PLMs, this paper proposes Comprehensive Instruction (CINS) that exploits PLMs with extra task-specific instructions. We design a schema (definition, constraint, prompt) of instructions and their customized realizations for three important downstream tasks in ToD, ie. intent classification, dialog state tracking, and natural language generation. A sequence-to-sequence model (T5) is adopted to solve these three tasks in a unified framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on these ToD tasks in realistic few-shot learning scenarios with small validation data. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed CINS approach consistently improves techniques that finetune PLMs with raw input or short prompt."}

The crux of the problem for a reinforcement learning agent in such TBGs is identifying the objects in the world, and those objects' relations with that world. While the recent use of text-based resources for increasing an agent's knowledge and improving its generalization have shown promise, we posit in this paper that there is much yet to be learned from visual representations of these same worlds. Specifically, we propose to retrieve images that represent specific instances of text observations from the world and train our agents on such images. This improves the agent's overall understanding of the game scene and objects' relationships to the world around them, and the variety of visual representations on offer allow the agent to generate a better generalization of a relationship. We show that incorporating such images improves the performance of agents in various TBG settings."}

We study how to plan short-term goal sequences as coherently as humans do and naturally direct them to an assigned long-term goal in open-domain conversations. Goal sequences are a series of knowledge graph (KG) entity-relation connections generated by KG walkers that traverse through the KG. The existing recurrent and graph attention based KG walkers either insufficiently utilize the conversation states or lack global guidance. In our work, a hierarchical model learns goal planning in a hierarchical learning framework. We present HiTKG, a hierarchical transformer-based graph walker that leverages multiscale inputs to make precise and flexible predictions on KG paths. Furthermore, we propose a two-hierarchy learning framework that employs two stages to learn both turn-level (short-term) and global-level (long-term) conversation goals. Specifically, at the first stage, HiTKG is trained in a supervised fashion to learn how to plan turn-level goal sequences; at the second stage, HiTKG tries to naturally approach the assigned global goal via reinforcement learning. In addition, we propose MetaPath as the backbone method for KG path representation to exploit the entity and relation information concurrently. We further propose Multi-source Decoding Inputs and Output-level Length Head to improve the decoding controllability. Our experiments show that HiTKG achieves a significant improvement in the performance of turn-level goal learning compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, both automatic and human evaluation prove the effectiveness of the two-hierarchy learning framework for both short-term and long-term goal planning."}

Existing methods only utilize the textual content of facts and legal articles to guide such a task. However, the citation network among case documents and legal statutes is a rich source of additional information, which is not considered by existing models.   In this work, we take the first step towards utilising both the text and the legal citation network for the LSI task.  We curate a large novel dataset for this task, including facts of cases from several major Indian Courts of Law, and statutes from the Indian Penal Code (IPC).   Modeling the statutes and training documents as a heterogeneous graph, our proposed model LeSICiN can learn rich textual and graphical features, and can also tune itself to correlate these features.   Thereafter, the model can be used to inductively predict links between test documents (new nodes whose graphical features are not available to the model) and statutes (existing nodes).   Extensive experiments on the dataset show that our model comfortably outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, by exploiting the graphical structure along with textual features."}

An emerging task in this context is that of free-form event process typing, which aims at understanding the overall goal of a protagonist in terms of an action and an object, given a sequence of events.  This task was initially treated as a learning-to-rank problem by exploiting the similarity between processes and action/object textual definitions.   However, this approach appears to be overly complex, binds the output types to a fixed inventory for possible word definitions and, moreover, leaves space for further enhancements as regards performance.  In this paper, we advance the field by reformulating the free-form event process typing task as a sequence generation problem and put forward STEPS, an end-to-end approach for producing user intent in terms of actions and objects only, dispensing with the need for their definitions.  In addition to this, we eliminate several dataset constraints set by previous works, while at the same time significantly outperforming them.

A typical system uses huge training samples for learning the correspondence between tables and texts. However, large training sets are expensive to obtain, limiting the applicability of these approaches in real-world scenarios. In this work, we focus on few-shot data-to-text generation. We observe that, while fine-tuned pretrained language models may generate plausible sentences, they suffer from the low semantic coverage problem in the few-shot setting. In other words, important input slots tend to be missing in the generated text. To this end, we propose a search-and-learning approach that leverages pretrained language models but inserts the missing slots to improve the semantic coverage. We further finetune our system based on the search results to smooth out the search noise, yielding better-quality text and improving inference efficiency to a large extent. Experiments show that our model achieves high performance on E2E and WikiBio datasets. Especially, we cover 98.35% of input slots on E2E, largely alleviating the low coverage problem."}

To address these issues, we devise a novel logical reasoner called Braid, that supports probabilistic rules, and uses the notion of custom unification functions and dynamic rule generation to overcome the brittle matching and knowledge-gap problem prevalent in traditional reasoners. In this paper, we describe the reasoning algorithms used in Braid, and their implementation in a distributed task-based framework that builds proof/explanation graphs for an input query. We use a simple QA example from a children’s story to motivate Braid’s design and explain how the various components work together to produce a coherent logical explanation.

Prior data augmentation methods for few-shot text classification have led to great performance boosts. However, they have not been designed to capture the intricate compositional structure of natural language. As a result, they fail to generate samples with plausible and diverse sentence structures. Motivated by this, we present the data Augmentation using Lexicalized Probabilistic context-free grammars (ALP) that generates augmented samples with diverse syntactic structures with plausible grammar. The lexicalized PCFG parse trees consider both the constituents and dependencies to produce a syntactic frame that maximizes a variety of word choices in a syntactically preservable manner without specific domain experts. Experiments on few-shot text classification tasks demonstrate that ALP enhances many state-of-the-art classification methods. As a second contribution, we delve into the train-val splitting methodologies when a data augmentation method comes into play. We argue empirically that the traditional splitting of training and validation sets is sub-optimal compared to our novel augmentation-based splitting strategies that further expand the training split with the same number of labeled data. Taken together, our contributions on the data augmentation strategies yield a strong training recipe for few-shot text classification tasks."}

However, for most users, image editing tools are not easy to use since the tools require certain expertise in photo effects and have complex interfaces. Hence, users might need someone to help edit their images, but having a personal dedicated human assistant for every user is impossible to scale. For that reason, an automated assistant system for image editing is desirable. Additionally, users want more image sources for diverse image editing works, and integrating an image search functionality into the editing tool is a potential remedy for this demand. Thus, we propose a dataset of an automated Conversational Agent for Image Search and Editing (CAISE). To our knowledge, this is the first dataset that provides conversational image search and editing annotations, where the agent holds a grounded conversation with users and helps them to search and edit images according to their requests. To build such a system, we first collect image search and editing conversations between pairs of annotators. The assistant-annotators are equipped with a customized image search and editing tool to address the requests from the user-annotators. The functions that the assistant-annotators conduct with the tool are recorded as executable commands, allowing the trained system to be useful for real-world application execution. We also introduce a generator-extractor baseline model for this task, which can adaptively select the source of the next token (i.e., from the vocabulary or from textual/visual contexts) for the executable command. This serves as a strong starting point while still leaving a large human-machine performance gap for useful future work. Data and code are available: https://github.com/hyounghk/CAISE."}

We also show how incorporating only a limited amount of task-specific knowledge from fully-trained embeddings can boost the performance NMT systems. Our findings demonstrate that in exchange for negligible deterioration in performance, any NMT model can be run with partially random embeddings. Working with such structures means a minimal memory requirement as there is no longer need to store large embedding tables, which is a significant gain in industrial and on-device settings. We evaluated our embeddings in translating English into German and French and achieved a 5.3x compression rate. Despite having a considerably smaller architecture, our models in some cases are even able to outperform state-of-the-art baselines."}

In the meantime, the recently proposed sequence tagging models can overcome the over-correction problem by only generating edit operations, but are conditioned on human designed language-specific tagging labels. In this paper, we combine the pros and alleviate the cons of both models by proposing a novel Sequence-to-Action (S2A) module. The S2A module jointly takes the source and target sentences as input, and is able to automatically generate a token-level action sequence before predicting each token, where each action is generated from three choices named SKIP, COPY and GENerate. Then the actions are fused with the basic seq2seq framework to provide final predictions. We conduct experiments on the benchmark datasets of both English and Chinese GEC tasks. Our model consistently outperforms the seq2seq baselines, while being able to significantly alleviate the over-correction problem as well as holding better generality and diversity in the generation results compared to the sequence tagging models."}

Many recent studies try to solve the task by developing pre-trained language models focusing on combining visual features from document images with texts and their layout. On the other hand, this paper tackles the problem by going back to the basic: effective combination of text and layout.  Specifically, we propose a pre-trained language model, named BROS (BERT Relying On Spatiality), that encodes relative positions of texts in 2D space and learns from unlabeled documents with area-masking strategy. With this optimized training scheme for understanding texts in 2D space, BROS shows comparable or better performance compared to previous methods on four KIE benchmarks (FUNSD, SROIE*, CORD, and SciTSR) without relying on visual features. This paper also reveals two real-world challenges in KIE tasks--(1) minimizing the error from incorrect text ordering and (2) efficient learning from fewer downstream examples--and demonstrates the superiority of BROS over previous methods."}

However, they are found to be vulnerable to some perturbations. Before they are widely adopted, the fundamental issues of robustness need to be addressed. In this paper, we design a robustness enhancement method to defend against word substitution perturbation, whose basic idea is to fight perturbation with perturbation. We find that: although many well-trained deep models are not robust in the setting of the presence of adversarial samples, they satisfy weak robustness. That means they can handle most non-crafted perturbations well. Taking advantage of the weak robustness property of deep models, we utilize non-crafted perturbations to resist the adversarial perturbations crafted by attackers. Our method contains two main stages. The first stage is using randomized perturbation to conform the input to the data distribution. The second stage is using randomized perturbation to eliminate the instability of prediction results and enhance the robustness guarantee. Experimental results show that our method can significantly improve the ability of deep models to resist the state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining the prediction performance on the original clean data."}

However, existing conversational agents and datasets do not consider such comprehensive information, and thus they have a limitation in generating the utterances where the knowledge and persona are fused properly. To address this issue, we introduce a call For Customized conversation (FoCus) dataset where the customized answers are built with the user's persona and Wikipedia knowledge. To evaluate the abilities to make informative and customized utterances of pre-trained language models, we utilize BART and GPT-2 as well as transformer-based models. We assess their generation abilities with automatic scores and conduct human evaluations for qualitative results. We examine whether the model reflects adequate persona and knowledge with our proposed two sub-tasks, persona grounding (PG) and knowledge grounding (KG). Moreover, we show that the utterances of our data are constructed with the proper knowledge and persona through grounding quality assessment."}

One such structural aspect present in text with chronology is the order of its presentation. For narratives or stories, this is known as the narrative order. Reordering a narrative can impact the temporal, causal, event-based, and other inferences readers draw from it, which in turn can have strong effects both on its interpretation and interestingness. In this paper, we propose and investigate the task of Narrative Reordering (NAREOR) which involves rewriting a given story in a different narrative order while preserving its plot. We present a dataset, NAREORC, with human rewritings of stories within ROCStories in non-linear orders, and conduct a detailed analysis of it. Further, we propose novel task-specific training methods with suitable evaluation metrics. We perform experiments on NAREORC using state-of-the-art models such as BART and T5 and conduct extensive automatic and human evaluations. We demonstrate that although our models can perform decently, NAREOR is a challenging task with potential for further exploration. We also investigate two applications of NAREOR: generation of more interesting variations of stories and serving as adversarial sets for temporal/event-related tasks, besides discussing other prospective ones, such as for pedagogical setups related to language skills like essay writing and applications to medicine involving clinical narratives."}

The traditional paradigm of image captioning relies on paired image-caption datasets to train the model in a supervised manner. However, creating such paired datasets for every target language is prohibitively expensive, which hinders the extensibility of captioning technology and deprives a large part of the world population of its benefit. In this work, we present a novel unpaired cross-lingual method to generate image captions without relying on any caption corpus in the source or the target language. Specifically, our method consists of two phases: (1) a cross-lingual auto-encoding process, which utilizing a sentence parallel (bitext) corpus to learn the mapping from the source to the target language in the scene graph encoding space and decode sentences in the target language, and (2) a cross-modal unsupervised feature mapping, which seeks to map the encoded scene graph features from image modality to language modality. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method on the Chinese image caption generation task. The comparisons against several existing methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

However, the conventional paradigm constructs the backbone by purely stacking the manually designed global self-attention layers, introducing inductive bias and thus leads to sub-optimal. In this work, we make the first attempt to automatically discover novel pre-trained language model (PLM) backbone on a flexible search space containing the most fundamental operations from scratch. Specifically, we propose a well-designed search space which (i) contains primitive math operations in the intra-layer level to explore novel attention structures, and (ii) leverages convolution blocks to be the supplementary for attentions in the inter-layer level to better learn local dependency. To enhance the efficiency for finding promising architectures, we propose an Operation-Priority Neural Architecture Search (OP-NAS) algorithm, which optimizes both the search algorithm and evaluation of candidate models. Specifically, we propose Operation-Priority (OP) evolution strategy to facilitate model search via balancing exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, we design a Bi-branch Weight-Sharing (BIWS) training strategy for fast model evaluation. Extensive experiments show that the searched architecture (named AutoBERT-Zero) significantly outperforms BERT and its variants of different model capacities in various downstream tasks, proving the architecture's transfer and scaling abilities. Remarkably, AutoBERT-Zero-base outperforms RoBERTa-base (using much more data) and BERT-large (with much larger model size) by 2.4 and 1.4 higher score on GLUE test set."}

If realized, such a CIS system has far-reaching benefits in the real world; for example, CIS systems can assist clinicians in pre-screening or triaging patients in healthcare. A key open sub-problem in CIS that remains unaddressed in the literature is generating Information Seeking Questions (ISQs) based on a short initial query from the end-user. To address this open problem, we propose Information SEEking Question generator (ISEEQ), a novel approach for generating ISQs from just a short user query, given a large text corpus relevant to the user query. Firstly, ISEEQ uses a knowledge graph to enrich the user query. Secondly, ISEEQ uses the knowledge-enriched query to retrieve relevant context passages to ask coherent ISQs adhering to a conceptual flow. Thirdly, ISEEQ introduces a new deep generative-adversarial reinforcement learning-based approach for generating ISQs. We show that ISEEQ can generate high-quality ISQs to promote the development of CIS agents. ISEEQ significantly outperforms comparable baselines on five ISQ evaluation metrics across four datasets having user queries from diverse domains. Further, we argue that ISEEQ is transferable across domains for generating ISQs, as it shows the acceptable performance when trained and tested on different pairs of domains. A qualitative human evaluation confirms that ISEEQ generated ISQs are comparable in quality to human-generated questions, and it outperformed the best comparable baseline."}

A recent study showed that a similar methodology can also be applied to the audio domain. Specifically, the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) achieves state-of-the-art results on various audio classification benchmarks. However, pure Transformer models tend to require more training data compared to CNNs, and the success of the AST relies on supervised pretraining that requires a large amount of labeled data and a complex training pipeline, thus limiting the practical usage of AST. This paper focuses on audio and speech classification, and aims to reduce the need for large amounts of labeled data for the AST by leveraging self-supervised learning using unlabeled data. Specifically, we propose to pretrain the AST model with joint discriminative and generative masked spectrogram patch modeling (MSPM) using unlabeled audio from AudioSet and Librispeech. We evaluate our pretrained models on both audio and speech classification tasks including audio event classification, keyword spotting, emotion recognition, and speaker identification. The proposed self-supervised framework significantly boosts AST performance on all tasks, with an average improvement of 60.9%, leading to similar or even better results than a supervised pretrained AST. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first patch-based self-supervised learning framework in the audio and speech domain, and also the first self-supervised learning framework for AST."}

Common Transformer encoders used in NLP tasks process the hidden states of all input tokens in the context paragraph throughout all layers. However, different from other tasks such as sequence classification, answering the raised question does not necessarily need all the tokens in the context paragraph. Following this motivation, we propose Block-skim, which learns to skim unnecessary context in higher hidden layers to improve and accelerate the Transformer performance. The key idea of Block-Skim is to identify the context that must be further processed and those that could be safely discarded early on during inference. Critically, we find that such information could be sufficiently derived from the self-attention weights inside the Transformer model. We further prune the hidden states corresponding to the unnecessary positions early in lower layers, achieving significant inference-time speedup. To our surprise, we observe that models pruned in this way outperform their full-size counterparts. Block-Skim improves QA models' accuracy on different datasets and achieves 3 times speedup on BERT-base model."}

In this paper, we propose GALAXY, a novel pre-trained dialog model that explicitly learns dialog policy from limited labeled dialogs and large-scale unlabeled dialog corpora via semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we introduce a dialog act prediction task for policy optimization during pre-training and employ a consistency regularization term to refine the learned representation with the help of unlabeled dialogs.

Most existing neural models make predictions without giving clues about which part of a false claim goes wrong. In this paper, we propose LOREN, an approach for interpretable fact verification. We decompose the verification of the whole claim at phrase-level, where the veracity of the phrases serves as explanations and can be aggregated into the final verdict according to logical rules. The key insight of LOREN is to represent claim phrase veracity as three-valued latent variables, which are regularized by aggregation logical rules. The final claim verification is based on all latent variables. Thus, LOREN enjoys the additional benefit of interpretability --- it is easy to explain how it reaches certain results with claim phrase veracity. Experiments on a public fact verification benchmark show that LOREN is competitive against previous approaches while enjoying the merit of faithful and accurate interpretability.

Despite their success, existing works building their meta-learner based on Prototypical Networks are unsatisfactory in learning discriminative text representations between similar classes, which may lead to contradictions during label prediction. In addition, the task-level and instance-level overfitting problems in few-shot text classification caused by a few training examples are not sufficiently tackled. In this work, we propose a contrastive learning framework named ContrastNet to tackle both discriminative representation and overfitting problems in few-shot text classification. ContrastNet learns to pull closer text representations belonging to the same class and push away text representations belonging to different classes, while simultaneously introducing unsupervised contrastive regularization at both task-level and instance-level to prevent overfitting. Experiments on 8 few-shot text classification datasets show that ContrastNet outperforms the current state-of-the-art models."}

Recent approaches use training data only in a resource-rich language (such as English) to fine-tune large-scale cross-lingual pre-trained language models, which transfer knowledge from resource-rich languages (source) to low-resource languages (target). Due to the big difference between languages, the model fine-tuned only by the source language may not perform well for target languages. In our study, we make an interesting observation that while the top 1 result predicted by the previous approaches may often fail to hit the ground-truth answer, there are still good chances for the correct answer to be contained in the set of top k predicted results. Intuitively, the previous approaches have empowered the model certain level of capability to roughly distinguish good answers from bad ones. However, without sufficient training data, it is not powerful enough to capture the nuances between the accurate answer and those approximate ones. Based on this observation, we develop a two-stage approach to enhance the model performance. The first stage targets at recall; we design a hard-learning (HL) algorithm to maximize the likelihood that the top k predictions contain the accurate answer. The second stage focuses on precision, where an answer-aware contrastive learning (AA-CL) mechanism is developed to learn the minute difference between the accurate answer and other candidates. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly outperforms strong baselines on two cross-lingual MRC benchmark datasets."}

In this work, we study what specific traits in the pre-training data, other than the semantics, make a pre-trained LM superior to their counterparts trained from scratch on downstream tasks.  We propose to use artificially constructed datasets as the pre-training data to exclude the effect of semantics, and further control what characteristics the pre-training corpora have.  By fine-tuning the pre-trained models on GLUE benchmark, we can learn how beneficial it is to transfer the knowledge from the model trained on the dataset possessing that specific trait.  We define and discuss three different characteristics in the artificial dataset: 1) matching the token's uni-gram or bi-gram distribution between pre-training and downstream fine-tuning, 2) the presence of the explicit dependencies among the tokens in a sequence, 3) the length of the implicit dependencies among the tokens in a sequence.   Our experiments show that the explicit dependencies in the sequences of the pre-training data are critical to the downstream performance.  Our results also reveal that models achieve better downstream performance when pre-trained on a dataset with a longer range of implicit dependencies.  Based on our analysis, we find that models pre-trained with artificial datasets are prone to learn spurious correlation in downstream tasks.  Our work reveals that even if the LMs are not pre-trained on natural language, they still gain transferability on certain human language downstream tasks once the LMs learn to model the token dependencies in the sequences.   This result helps us understand the exceptional transferability of pre-trained LMs."}

We thus aim to leverage contrastive learning and counterfactual augmentation for robustness. For augmentation, existing work either requires humans to add counterfactuals to the dataset or machines to automatically matches near-counterfactuals already in the dataset. Unlike existing augmentation is affected by spurious correlations, ours, by synthesizing “a set” of counterfactuals, and making a collective decision on the distribution of predictions on this set, can robustly supervise the causality of each term. Our empirical results show that our approach, by collective decisions, is less sensitive to task model bias of attribution-based synthesis, and thus achieves significant improvements, in diverse dimensions: 1) counterfactual robustness, 2) cross-domain generalization, and 3) generalization from scarce data."}

Additionally, human annotation campaigns are time-consuming and include non-reusable human labour. In practice, researchers rely on automatic metrics as a proxy of quality. In the last decade, many string-based metrics (e.g., BLEU or ROUGE) have been introduced. However, such metrics usually rely on exact matches and thus, do not robustly handle synonyms. In this paper, we introduce InfoLM a family of untrained metrics that can be viewed as a string-based metric that addresses the aforementioned flaws thanks to a pre-trained masked language model. This family of metrics also makes use of information measures allowing the possibility to adapt InfoLM to different evaluation criteria.

We aim to fill the gap between the accuracy and the interpretability in global forecasting approaches.   In order to explain the global model forecasts, we propose Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Rule-based Explanations for Forecasting (LIMREF), which is a local explainer framework that produces k-optimal impact rules for a particular forecast, considering the global forecasting model as a black-box model, in a model-agnostic way. It provides different types of rules which explain the forecast of the global model and the counterfactual rules, which provide actionable insights for potential changes to obtain different outputs for given instances. We conduct experiments using a large-scale electricity demand dataset with exogenous features such as temperature and calendar effects. Here, we evaluate the quality of the explanations produced by the LIMREF framework in terms of both qualitative and quantitative aspects such as accuracy, fidelity and comprehensibility, and benchmark those against other local explainers."}

However, the technical challenges in individual financial risk evaluation exacerbated by the unforeseen user characteristic distribution and limited credit history of new users, as well as the inexperience of newly-entered companies in handling complex data and obtaining accurate labels, impede further promotion of financial inclusion. To tackle these challenges, this paper develops a novel transfer learning algorithm (i.e., TransBoost) that combines the merits of tree-based models and kernel methods.

With the advent of reliable spatiotemporal data, graph neural network models have been able to successfully model the inter-relation between the cross-region signals to produce quality forecasts, but like most deep-learning models they do not explicitly incorporate the underlying causal mechanisms. In this work, we employ a causal mechanistic model to guide the learning of the graph embeddings and propose a novel learning framework -- Causal-based Graph Neural Network (CausalGNN) that learns spatiotemporal embedding in a latent space where graph input features and epidemiological context are combined via a mutually learning mechanism using graph-based non-linear transformations. We design an attention-based dynamic GNN module to capture spatial and temporal disease dynamics. A causal module is added to the framework to provide epidemiological context for node embedding via ordinary differential equations. Extensive experiments on forecasting daily new cases of COVID-19 at global, US state, and US county levels show that the proposed method outperforms a broad range of baselines. The learned model which incorporates epidemiological context organizes the embedding in an efficient way by keeping the parameter size small leading to robust and accurate forecasting performance across various datasets."}

In the literature, traditional statistic approaches, machine-learning methods and deep learning (e.g., recurrent neural network) based models are utilized to model the trends and patterns in electricity time-series data. However, they are restricted either by their deterministic forms or by independence in probabilistic assumptions -- thereby neglecting the uncertainty or significant correlations between distributions of electricity data. Ignoring these, in turn, may yield error accumulation, especially when relying on historical data and aiming at multi-step prediction. To overcome these, we propose a novel method named Probabilistic Electricity Forecasting (PrEF) by proposing a non-linear neural state space model (SSM) and incorporating copula-augmented mechanism into that, which can learn uncertainty-dependencies knowledge and understand interactive relationships between various factors from large-scale electricity time-series data. Our method distinguishes itself from existing models by its traceable inference procedure and its capability of providing high-quality probabilistic distribution predictions.

Spatial biases incurred by learning, if left unattended, may cause or exacerbate unfair distribution of resources, social division, spatial disparity, etc. The goal of this work is to develop statistically-robust formulations and model-agnostic learning strategies to understand and promote spatial fairness. The problem is challenging as locations are often from continuous spaces with no well-defined categories (e.g., gender), and statistical conclusions from spatial data are fragile to changes in spatial partitionings and scales. Existing studies in fairness-driven learning have generated valuable insights related to non-spatial factors including race, gender, education level, etc., but research to mitigate location-related biases still remains in its infancy, leaving the main challenges unaddressed. To bridge the gap, we first propose a robust space-as-distribution (SPAD) representation of spatial fairness to reduce statistical sensitivity related to partitioning and scales in continuous space. Furthermore, we propose a new SPAD-based stochastic strategy to efficiently optimize over an extensive distribution of fairness criteria, and a bi-level training framework to enforce fairness via adaptive adjustment of priorities among locations. Experiments on real-world crop monitoring show that SPAD can effectively reduce sensitivity in fairness evaluation and the stochastic bi-level training framework can greatly improve the fairness."}

To address the issue, privacy-leaking image detection is studied recently, with the goal to automatically identify images that may leak privacy. Recent advance on this task benefits from focusing on crucial objects via pretrained object detectors and modeling their correlation. However, these methods have two limitations: 1) they neglect other important elements like scenes, textures, and objects beyond the capacity of pretrained object detectors. 2) the correlation among objects is fixed, but a fixed correlation is not appropriate for all the images. To overcome the limitations, we propose the Dynamic Region-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (DRAG) that dynamically finds out crucial regions including objects and other important elements, and model their correlation adaptively for each input image. To find out crucial regions, we cluster spatially-correlated feature channels into several region-aware feature maps. Furthermore, we dynamically model the correlation with the self-attention mechanism and explore the interaction among the regions with a graph convolutional network. The DRAG achieved an accuracy of 87% on the largest dataset for privacy-leaking image detection, which is 10 percentage points higher than the state of the art. The further case study demonstrates that it found out crucial regions containing not only objects but other important elements like textures. The code and more details are in https://github.com/guang-yanng/DRAG."}

However, most prior work on detecting depression mainly focused on detecting depressed individuals in laboratory settings, which are difficult to be generalized in practice. In addition, little attention has been paid to analyzing the non-verbal behaviors of depressed individuals in the wild. Therefore, in this paper, we present a multimodal depression dataset, D-Vlog, which consists of 961 vlogs (i.e., around 160 hours) collected from YouTube, which can be utilized in developing depression detection models based on the non-verbal behavior of individuals in real-world scenario. We develop a multimodal deep learning model that uses acoustic and visual features extracted from collected data to detect depression. Our proposed model employs the cross-attention mechanism to effectively capture the relationship across acoustic and visual features, and generates useful multimodal representations for depression detection. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms other baseline models. We believe our dataset and the proposed model are useful for analyzing and detecting depressed individuals based on non-verbal behavior."}

Our analysis on data derived from a real-world food delivery platform across three large cities from India show that there is significant inequality in the money delivery agents earn. In this paper, we formulate the problem of fair income distribution among agents while also ensuring timely food delivery. We establish that the problem is not only NP-hard but also inapproximable in polynomial time. We overcome this computational bottleneck through a novel matching algorithm called FairFoody. Extensive experiments over real-world food delivery datasets show FairFoody imparts up to 10 times improvement in equitable income distribution when compared to baseline strategies, while also ensuring minimal impact on customer experience."}

For medical images, a feature attribution map, or heatmap, is the most common form of explanation that highlights important features for AI models' prediction. However, it is unknown how well heatmaps perform on explaining decisions on multi-modal medical images, where each image modality or channel visualizes distinct clinical information of the same underlying biomedical phenomenon. Understanding such modality-dependent features is essential for clinical users' interpretation of AI decisions. To tackle this clinically important but technically ignored problem, we propose the modality-specific feature importance (MSFI) metric. It encodes clinical image and explanation interpretation patterns of modality prioritization and modality-specific feature localization. We conduct a clinical requirement-grounded, systematic evaluation using computational methods and a clinician user study. Results show that the examined 16 heatmap algorithms failed to fulfill clinical requirements to correctly indicate AI model decision process or decision quality. The evaluation and MSFI metric can guide the design and selection of explainable AI algorithms to meet clinical requirements on multi-modal explanation."}

Much recent work has focused on developing algorithmic tools to assess and mitigate such unfairness. However, there is little work on enhancing fairness in graph algorithms. Here, we develop a simple, effective and general method, CrossWalk, that enhances fairness of various graph algorithms, including influence maximization, link prediction and node classification, applied to node embeddings. CrossWalk is applicable to any random walk based node representation learning algorithm, such as DeepWalk and Node2Vec. The key idea is to bias random walks to cross group boundaries, by upweighting edges which (1) are closer to the groups’ peripheries or (2) connect different groups in the network. CrossWalk pulls nodes that are near groups’ peripheries towards their neighbors from other groups in the embedding space, while preserving the necessary structural properties of the graph. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our algorithm to enhance fairness in various graph algorithms, including influence maximization, link prediction and node classification in synthetic and real networks, with only a very small decrease in performance."}

In this paper, we present a novel approach to assessing the economic impact with a large-scale credit card transaction dataset at a fine granularity. For this purpose, we develop a fine-grained economic-epidemiological modeling framework COVID-EENet, which is featured with a two-level deep neural network. In support of the fine-grained EEM, COVID-EENet learns the impact of nearby mass infection cases on the changes of local economies in each district. Through the experiments using the nationwide dataset, given a set of active mass infection cases, COVID-EENet is shown to precisely predict the sales changes in two or four weeks for each district and business category. Therefore, policymakers can be informed of the predictive impact to put in the most effective mitigation measures. Overall, we believe that our work opens a new perspective of using financial data to recover from the economic crisis.

This paper describes our work to assist non-profits that employ automated messaging programs to deliver timely preventive care information to beneficiaries (new and expecting mothers) during pregnancy and after delivery. Unfortunately, a key challenge in such information delivery programs is that a significant fraction of beneficiaries drop out of the program. Yet, non-profits often have limited health-worker resources (time) to place crucial service calls for live interaction with beneficiaries to prevent such engagement drops. To assist non-profits in optimizing this limited resource, we developed a Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) system. One key technical contribution in this system is a novel clustering method of offline historical data to infer unknown RMAB parameters. Our second major contribution is evaluation of our RMAB system in collaboration with an NGO, via a real-world service quality improvement study. The study compared strategies for optimizing service calls to 23003 participants over a period of 7 weeks to reduce engagement drops. We show that the RMAB group provides statistically significant improvement over other comparison groups, reducing ~30% engagement drops. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the utility of RMABs in real world public health settings. We are transitioning our RMAB system to the NGO for real-world use."}

However, performing object detection over large geographies can still be prohibitively expensive due to the high cost of purchasing imagery and compute. Inspired by traditional survey data collection strategies, we propose an approach to estimate object count statistics over large geographies through sampling. Given a cost budget, our method selects a small number of representative areas by sampling from a learnable proposal distribution. Using importance sampling, we are able to accurately estimate object counts after processing only a small fraction of the images compared to an exhaustive approach. We show empirically that the proposed framework achieves strong performance on estimating the number of buildings in the United States and Africa, cars in Kenya, brick kilns in Bangladesh, and swimming pools in the U.S., while requiring as few as 0.01% of satellite images compared to an exhaustive approach."}

To demonstrate the relationship, most existing studies utilize subjective human perceptual attributes, categorization only for a few violent crimes, and images taken from still shot images. These lead to difficulty in identifying location-specific characteristics for urban safety. In this work, to address this problem, we propose a large-scale dataset and a novel method by adopting a concept of “Deviance\" which explains behaviors violating social norms, both formally (e.g. crime) and informally (e.g. civil complaints). We first collect a geo-tagged dataset consisting of incident report data for seven metropolitan cities, with corresponding sequential images around incident sites obtained from Google street view. We also design a convolutional neural network that learns spatio-temporal visual attributes of deviant streets. Experimental results show that our framework can reliably recognize real-world deviance in various cities. Furthermore, we analyze which visual attribute is important for deviance identification and severity estimation.

However, the rapid increase of the global population poses a challenge on this cornerstone by demanding more food. Modern autonomous greenhouses, equipped with sensors and actuators, provide a promising solution to the problem by empowering precise control for high-efficient food production. However, the optimal control of autonomous greenhouses is challenging, requiring decision-making based on high-dimensional sensory data, and the scaling of production is limited by the scarcity of labor capable of handling this task. With the advances of artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing technologies, we are hopeful to provide a solution to automate and smarten greenhouse control to address the above challenges. In this paper, we propose a smart agriculture solution named iGrow, for autonomous greenhouse control (AGC): (1) for the first time, we formulate the AGC problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) optimization problem; (2) we design a neural network-based simulator incorporated with the incremental mechanism to simulate the complete planting process of an autonomous greenhouse, which provides a testbed for the optimization of control strategies; (3) we propose a closed-loop bi-level optimization algorithm, which can dynamically re-optimize the greenhouse control strategy with newly observed data during real-world production. We not only conduct simulation experiments but also deploy iGrow in real scenarios, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of iGrow in autonomous greenhouse simulation and optimal control. Particularly, compelling results from the tomato pilot project in real autonomous greenhouses show that our solution significantly increases crop yield (+10.15%) and net profit (+92.70%) with statistical significance compared to planting experts. Our solution opens up a new avenue for greenhouse production. The code is available at https://github.com/holmescao/iGrow.git."}

However, its quality is suffered from lack of ample sources of expert information. This paper employs AMiner as the basis with an aim at linking any external experts to the counterparts on AMiner. As it is infeasible to acquire sufficient linkages from arbitrary external sources, we explore the problem of zero-shot expert linking. In this paper, we propose CODE, which first pre-trains an expert linking model by contrastive learning on AMiner such that it can capture the representation and matching patterns of experts without supervised signals, then it is fine-tuned between AMinerand external sources to enhance the model’s transferability in an adversarial manner. For evaluation, we first design two intrinsic tasks, author identification and paper clustering, to validate the representation and matching capability endowed by contrastive learning. Then the final external expert linking performance on two genres of external sources also implies the superiority of adversarial fine-tuning method. Additionally, we show the online deployment of CODE, and continuously improve its online performance via active learning."}

In this paper, and from an algorithmic perspective, we explore whether the chosen architecture, when trained with the same data, influences the level of gender bias. Experiments conducted in three language pairs show that language-specific encoder-decoders exhibit less bias than the shared architecture. We propose two methods for interpreting and studying gender bias in machine translation based on source embeddings and attention. Our analysis shows that, in the language-specific case, the embeddings encode more gender information, and their attention is more diverted. Both behaviors help in mitigating gender bias."}

Previous studies have shown that word embeddings trained on human-generated corpora have strong gender biases that can produce discriminative results in downstream tasks. Previous debiasing methods focus mainly on modeling bias and only implicitly consider semantic information while completely overlooking the complex underlying causal structure among bias and semantic components. To address these issues, we propose a novel methodology that leverages a causal inference framework to effectively remove gender bias. The proposed method allows us to construct and analyze the complex causal mechanisms facilitating gender information flow while retaining oracle semantic information within word embeddings. Our comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in gender-debiasing tasks. In addition, our methods yield better performance in word similarity evaluation and various extrinsic downstream NLP tasks."}

Accurately predicting crop yields is crucial for addressing these challenges. However, this prediction task is exceptionally complicated since crop yields depend on numerous factors such as weather, land surface, and soil quality, as well as their interactions. In recent years, machine learning models have been successfully applied in this domain. However, these models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only study over a single or few years, which makes them hard to generalize spatially and temporally. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural network for crop yield prediction, to incorporate both geographical and temporal knowledge in the model, and further boost predictive power. Our method is trained, validated, and tested on over 2000 counties from 41 states in the US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the first machine learning method that embeds geographical knowledge in crop yield prediction and predicts crop yields at the county level nationwide. We also laid a solid foundation by comparing our model on a nationwide scale with other well-known baseline methods, including linear models, tree-based models, and deep learning methods. Experiments show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on various metrics, validating the effectiveness of geospatial and temporal information."}

Our evaluation procedures produce aggregated performance metrics that lack detail and quantified uncertainty about the following question: how will an AI system, with a particular profile pi, behave for a new problem, characterised by a particular situation mu? Instead of just aggregating test results, we can use machine learning methods to fully capitalise on this evaluation information. In this paper, we introduce the concept of an assessor model, hat{R}(r|pi,mu), a conditional probability estimator trained on test data. We discuss how these assessors can be built by using information of the full system-problem space and illustrate a broad range of applications that derive from varied inferences and aggregations from hat{R}. Building good assessor models will change the predictive and explanatory power of AI evaluation and will lead to new research directions for building and using them. We propose accompanying every deployed AI system with its own assessor."}

Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) is a well-known AI technique to diagnose faults in systems. In this approach, a model of the diagnosed system is given, and the real system is observed. A failure is announced when the real system's output contradicts the model's expected output. The model is then used to deduce the defective components that explain the unexpected observation. MBD has been increasingly being deployed in distributed and multi-agent systems. In this survey, we summarize twenty years of research in the field of model-based diagnosis algorithms for MAS diagnosis. We depict three attributes that should be considered when examining MAS diagnosis: (1) The objective of the diagnosis. Either diagnosing faults in the MAS plans or diagnosing coordination faults. (2) Centralized vs. distributed. The diagnosis method could be applied either by a centralized agent or by the agents in a distributed manner. (3) Temporal vs. non-temporal. Temporal diagnosis is used to diagnose the MAS's temporal behaviors, whereas non-temporal diagnosis is used to diagnose the conduct based on a single observation. We survey diverse studies in MBD of MAS based on these attributes, and provide novel research challenges in this field for the AI community."}

However, automatic generation of high-quality test suites is challenging, especially for software that takes in highly-structured inputs, such as the compilers. Compiler fuzzing remains difficult as generating tons of syntactically and semantically valid programs is not trivial. Most previous methods either depend on human-crafted grammars or heuristics to learn partial language patterns. They both suffer from the completeness issue that is a classic puzzle in software testing. To mitigate the problem, we propose a knowledge-guided reinforcement learning-based approach to generating valid programs for compiler fuzzing. We first design a naive learning model which evolves with the sequential mutation rewards provided by a target compiler we test. By iterating the training cycle, the model learns to generate valid programs that can improve the testing efficacy as well. We implement the proposed method into a tool called ALPHAPROG. We analyze the framework with four different reward functions and our study reveal the effectiveness of  ALPHAPROG for compiler testing. We also reported two important bugs for a compiler production that were confirmed and addressed by the project owner, which further demonstrates ALPHAPROG's applied value in practice."}

When most credit risk models are built using only applicants who had been funded for credit, such non-random sampling predominantly influenced by credit policymakers and previous loan performances may introduce sampling bias to the models, and thus alter their prediction of default on loan repayment when screening applications from prospective borrowers. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method that aims to identify and pseudo-label parts of the historically declined loan applications to mitigate sampling bias in the training data. We also introduce a new measure to assess the performance from the business perspective, loan application approval rates at various loan default rate levels. Our proposed methods were compared to the original supervised learning model and the traditional sampling issue remedy techniques in the industry. The experiment and early production results from deployed model show that self-training method with calibrated probability as data augmentation selection criteria improved the ability of credit scoring to differentiate default loan applications and, more importantly, can increase loan approval rate up to 8.8%,  while keeping similar default rate comparing to baselines. The results demonstrate practical implications on how future underwriting model development processes should follow."}

In this paper, we tackle this challenge by employing data-driven techniques to develop forecasting tools for three widely used crop-productivity related variables (i.e., actual evapotranspiration, reference evapotranspiration, and net primary production), which can then be used by farmers to take corrective actions on their farms. Prior work in this domain, despite using data-driven methods, suffers from two major limitations: (i) they mainly focus on estimating variable values (as opposed to forecasting the future); and (ii) they mostly use classical Machine Learning (ML) prediction models, despite the abundance of data sufficient to train sophisticated deep learning models. To fill this research gap, we collaborate with PlantVillage, the world’s leading non-profit agricultural knowledge delivery platform for African farmers, to identify ∼2,200 smallholder farm locations, and gather remote-sensed data of these farms over a period of five years. Next, we propose CLIMATES, a meta-algorithm leveraging structural insights about temporal patterns of this time-series data to accurately forecast their future values. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in this domain. Our experimental results show that CLIMATES outperforms several state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models.

However, usability of these conversations offer challenges due to them being and scarcity of conversation utterance label. This paper presents a novel approach for issue artefact extraction from noisy conversations with minimal labelled data. We propose a combination of unsupervised and supervised models with minimal human intervention that leverages domain knowledge to predict artefacts for a small amount of conversation data and use that for fine-tuning an already pre-trained language model for artefact prediction on a large amount of conversation data. Experimental results on our dataset show that the proposed ensemble of the unsupervised and supervised models is better than using either one of them individually.

We propose a generic framework, that leverages deep visual Representation Learning at its heart, to address this problem for our fashion e-commerce platform. Our framework could be trained with supervisory signals in the form of triplets, that are obtained manually. However, it is infeasible to obtain manual annotations for the entire huge collection of data usually present in fashion e-commerce platforms, such as ours, while capturing all the difficult corner cases. But, to our rescue, interestingly we observed that this crucial problem in fashion e-commerce could also be solved by simple color jitter based image augmentation, that recently became widely popular in the contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) literature, that seeks to learn visual representations without using manual labels. This naturally led to a question in our mind: Could we leverage SSL in our use-case, and still obtain comparable performance to our supervised framework? The answer is, Yes! because, color variant fashion objects are nothing but manifestations of a style, in different colors, and a model trained to be invariant to the color (with, or without supervision), should be able to recognize this! This is what the paper further demonstrates, both qualitatively, and quantitatively, while evaluating a couple of state-of-the-art SSL techniques, and also proposing a novel method."}

PaintTeR combines a lexicon of painting words curated automatically through distant supervision with random walks on a large-scale word co-occurrence graph for ranking passage spans for artistic characteristics. The spans extracted with PaintTeR are used in state-of-the-art Question Generation and Reading Comprehension models for designing an interactive aid that enables gallery and museum visitors focus on the artistic elements of paintings. We provide experiments on two datasets of expert-written passages on paintings to showcase the effectiveness of PaintTeR. Evaluations by both gallery experts as well as crowdworkers indicate that our proposed algorithm can be used to select relevant and interesting art-centered questions. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to effectively fine-tune question generation models using minimal supervision for a low-resource, specialized context such as gallery visits."}

With the wider adoption of precision agriculture - an agriculture management strategy that involves gathering, processing and analyzing temporal, spatial and individual data - in both developed and developing countries, there is an increasing opportunity to harness accumulating, shareable, big data using artificial intelligence (AI) methods, collected from weather stations, field sensor networks, Internet-of-Things devices, unmanned aerial vehicles, and earth observational satellites. This requires smart algorithms tailored to agricultural data types, integrated into digital solutions that are viable, flexible, and scalable for wide deployment for a wide variety of agricultural users and decision-makers. We discuss a novel AI approach that addresses the real-world problem of developing a viable solution for reliably, timely, and cost-effectively forecasting crop status across large agricultural regions using Earth observational information in near-real-time. Our approach is based on extracting time-conditioned topological features which characterize complex spatio-temporal dependencies between crop production regions and integrating such topological signatures into Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). We discuss utility and limitations of the resulting zigzag persistence-based LSTM (ZZTop-LSTM) as a new tool for developing more informed crop insurance rate-making and accurate tracking of changing risk exposures and vulnerabilities within insurance risk areas."}

As in other deck-building games, such as trading card games, designers must balance the cards to permit a wide variety of competitive strategies.  We present Ludus, a framework that combines automated playtesting with global search to optimize parameters for each card that will assist designers in balancing new content.  We develop a sampling-based approximation to reduce the playtesting needed during optimization.  To guide the global search, we define metrics characterizing the health of the metagame and explore their impacts on the results of the optimization process.

If one were redesigning Dominion, therefore, it may be useful to identify game elements that reduce the number of viable strategies in any given game configuration - i.e. elements that are unbalanced. In this paper, we propose an approach that assigns credit to the outcome of an episode to individual elements. Our approach uses statistical analysis to learn the interactions and dependencies between game elements.  This learned knowledge is used to recommend elements to game designers for further consideration. Designers may then choose to modify the recommended elements with the goal of increasing the number of viable strategies."}

Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a crucial part of that system. It is about inferring the skill mastery of students and predicting their performance to adjust the curriculum accordingly. Deep Learning based models like Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN) have shown significant predictive performance compared with traditional models like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Performance Factors Analysis (PFA). However, it is difficult to extract psychologically meaningful explanations from the tens of thousands of parameters in neural networks, that would relate to cognitive theory. There are several ways to achieve high accuracy in student performance prediction but diagnostic and prognostic reasonings are more critical in learning science. In this work, we present Interpretable Knowledge Tracing (IKT), a simple model that relies on three meaningful features: individual skill mastery, ability profile (learning transfer across skills) and problem difficulty by using data mining techniques. IKT’s prediction of future student performance is made using a Tree Augmented Naive Bayes Classifier (TAN), therefore its predictions are easier to explain than deep learning based student models. IKT also shows better student performance prediction than deep learning based student models without requiring a huge amount of parameters. We conduct ablation studies on each feature to examine their contribution to student performance prediction. Thus, IKT has great potential for providing adaptive and personalized instructions with causal reasoning in real-world educational systems."}

Existing methods for AQQR rely solely on explicitly-defined criteria such as readability and word count, while not fully utilising the power of state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques. We propose DeepQR, a novel neural-network model for AQQR that is trained using multiple-choice-question (MCQ) datasets collected from PeerWise, a widely-used learnersourcing platform. Along with designing DeepQR, we investigate models based on explicitly-defined features, or semantic features, or both. We also introduce a self-attention mechanism to capture semantic correlations between MCQ components, and a contrastive-learning approach to acquire question representations using quality ratings. Extensive experiments on datasets collected from eight university-level courses illustrate that DeepQR has superior performance over six comparative models."}

The state council and the ministry of education of China put AI education for K-12 schools on a high priority in order to foster local AI talents and reduce educational disparities. However, the AI knowledge and technical skills are still limited for not only students but also the school teachers. Furthermore, many local schools in China, especially in the rural areas, are lack of the necessary software and hardware for teaching AI. Hence, we designed and implemented a structured series of AI courses, built on an online block-based visual programming platform. The AI courses are free and easily accessible for all. We have conducted the experimental classes in a local school and collected the results. The results show that the learners in general gained significant learning progress on AI knowledge comprehension, aroused strong interests in AI, and increased the degree of satisfaction towards the course. Especially, our practices significantly increased computational thinking of the students who were initially staying at a lower level."}

The consensus mechanism at the center of blockchain is often criticized for wasting a large amount of computing power for meaningless hashing. At the same time, state-of-the-art models in deep learning require increasing computing power to be trained. Proof of Learning (PoL) is dedicated to using the originally wasted computing power to train neural networks. Most of the previous PoL consensus mechanisms are based on two methods, recomputation or performance metrics. However, in practical scenarios, these methods both do not satisfy all properties necessary to build a large-scale blockchain, such as certainty, constant verification, therefore are still far away from being practical. In this paper, we observe that the opacity of deep learning models is similar to the pre-image resistance of hash functions and can naturally be used to build PoL. Based on our observation, we propose a method called Directed Guiding Gradient. Using this method, our proposed PoL consensus mechanism has a similar structure to the widely used Proof of Work (PoW), allowing us to build practical blockchain on it and train neutral networks simultaneously. In experiments, we build a blockchain on top of our proposed PoL consensus mechanism and results show that our PoL works well."}

Since most existing NA methods have attempted to discover every node pair at once, they may fail to utilize node pairs that have strong consistency across different networks in the NA task. To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align, a new NA method that gradually discovers node pairs by making full use of either node pairs exhibiting strong consistency or prior matching information. Specifically, the proposed method gradually aligns nodes based on both the similarity of embeddings generated using graph neural networks (GNNs) and the Tversky similarity, which is an asymmetric set similarity using the Tversky index applicable to networks with different scales. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that Grad-Align consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NA methods in terms of the alignment accuracy.

This paper proposes an end-to-end framework for NER for Indian languages in a low-resource setting by exploiting parallel corpora of English and Indian languages and an English NER dataset. The proposed framework includes an annotation projection method that combines word alignment score and NER tag prediction confidence score on source language (English) data to generate weakly labeled data in a target Indian language. We employ a variant of the Teacher-Student model and optimize it jointly on the pseudo labels of the Teacher model and predictions on the generated weakly labeled data. We also present manually annotated test sets for three Indian languages: Hindi, Bengali, and Gujarati. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on the test sets of the three Indian languages. Empirical results show a minimum 10% performance improvement compared to the zero-shot transfer learning model on all languages. This indicates that weakly labeled data generated using the proposed annotation projection method in target Indian languages can complement well-annotated source language data to enhance performance.

However, the global learning model can significantly deteriorate if a Byzantine attacker transmits malicious learning models trained with incorrectly labeled data. We propose a Byzantine-robust FL algorithm that, by employing a consensus confirmation method, can reduce the success probability of Byzantine attacks. After aggregating the local models from clients, the proposed FL server validates the global model candidate by sending the global model candidate to a set of randomly selected FL clients and asking them to perform local validation with their local data. If most of the validation is positive, the global model is confirmed and broadcast to all the clients. We compare the performance of the proposed FL against Byzantine attacks with that of existing FL algorithms analytically and empirically."}

We propose and implement a novel intelligent decision support system for server merge (SM) for maintaining the game ecology at the macro level. The services provided by this system include server health diagnosis, server merge assessment, and combination strategy recommendation. Specifically, we design an effective time series prediction algorithm to diagnose the health status of one server (e.g., user activity, online time, daily revenue) based on real game scenarios, and then select the servers with poor status from all servers. Moreover, to dig out the inherent development laws of servers from the historical merge records, we leverage a correlation measurement algorithm to find the historical merged servers that are similar to the servers to be merged and then evaluate the potential trend after merging, which can assist experts to make reasonable decisions. We deploy our system into practice for multiple MMORPGs and achieve sound online performance endorsed by the game operation team."}

Voxel representations contribute to efficiently and rapidly locating objects, whereas point representations are capable of describing intra-object spatial relationship for detection refinement. In this work, we aim to exploit the strengths of both two representations, and present a novel two-stage detector, named Joint Point-Voxel Network (JPV-Net). Specifically, our framework is equipped with a Dual Encoders-Fusion Decoder, which consists of the dual encoders to extract voxel features of sketchy 3D scenes and point features rich in geometric context, respectively, and the Feature Propagation Fusion (FP-Fusion) decoder to attentively fuse them from coarse to fine. By making use of the advantages of these features, the refinement network can effectively eliminate false detection and provide better accuracy. Besides, to further develop the perception characteristics of voxel CNN and point backbone, we design two novel intersection-over-union (IoU) estimation modules for proposal generation and refinement, both of which can alleviate the misalignment between the localization and the classification confidence.

In this work, we first empirically investigate when and why unsupervised pretraining surpasses supervised counterparts for image classification tasks with a series of control experiments. Besides the commonly used accuracy, we further analyze the results qualitatively with the class activation maps and assess the learned representations quantitatively with the representation entropy and uniformity. Our core finding is that it is the amount of information effectively perceived by the learning model that is crucial to transfer learning, instead of absolute size of the dataset. Based on this finding, we propose Classification Activation Map guided contrastive (CAMtrast) learning which better utilizes the label supervsion to strengthen supervised pretraining, by making the networks perceive more information from the training images. CAMtrast is evaluated with three fundamental visual learning tasks: image recognition, object detection, and semantic segmentation, on various public datasets. Experimental results show that our CAMtrast effectively improves the performance of supervised pretraining, and that its performance is superior to both unsupervised counterparts and a recent related work which similarly attempted improving supervised pretraining."}

However, most existing methods focus on the former and ignore the latter, resulting in a failure to achieve desired results. To solve the above problems, we propose a unified Symmetric Semantic-Aware Transformer (SSAT) network, which incorporates semantic correspondence learning to realize makeup transfer and removal simultaneously. In SSAT, a novel Symmetric Semantic Corresponding Feature Transfer (SSCFT) module and a weakly supervised semantic loss are proposed to model and facilitate the establishment of accurate semantic correspondence. In the generation process, the extracted makeup features are spatially distorted by SSCFT to achieve semantic alignment with the target image, then the distorted makeup features are combined with unmodified makeup irrelevant features to produce the final result. Experiments show that our method obtains more visually accurate makeup transfer results, and user study in comparison with other state-of-the-art makeup transfer methods reflects the superiority of our method. Besides, we verify the robustness of the proposed method in the difference of expression and pose, object occlusion scenes, and extend it to video makeup transfer."}

In this work, we explore whether the core self-attention module in Transformer is the key to achieving excellent performance in image recognition. To this end, we build an attention-free network called sMLPNet based on the existing MLP-based vision models. Specifically, we replace the MLP module in the token-mixing step with a novel sparse MLP (sMLP) module. For 2D image tokens, sMLP applies 1D MLP along the axial directions and the parameters are shared among rows or columns. By sparse connection and weight sharing, sMLP module significantly reduces the number of model parameters and computational complexity, avoiding the common over-fitting problem that plagues the performance of MLP-like models. When only trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset, the proposed sMLPNet achieves 81.9% top-1 accuracy with only 24M parameters, which is much better than most CNNs and vision Transformers under the same model size constraint. When scaling up to 66M parameters, sMLPNet achieves 83.4% top-1 accuracy, which is on par with the state-of-the-art Swin Transformer. The success of sMLPNet suggests that the self-attention mechanism is not necessarily a silver bullet in computer vision.

A number of methods for this task are always based on voxelized scene representations. Although voxel representations keep local structures of the scene, these methods suffer from heavy computation redundancy due to the existence of visible empty voxels when the network goes deeper. To address this dilemma, we propose our novel point-voxel aggregation network for this task. We first transfer the voxelized scenes to point clouds by removing these visible empty voxels and adopt a deep point stream to capture semantic information from the scene efficiently. Meanwhile, a light-weight voxel stream containing only two 3D convolution layers preserves local structures of the voxelized scenes. Furthermore, we design an anisotropic voxel aggregation operator to fuse the structure details from the voxel stream into the point stream, and a semantic-aware propagation module to enhance the up-sampling process in the point stream by semantic labels. We demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-arts on two benchmarks by a large margin, with only the depth images as input."}

In the literature, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the de-facto standard and they are either trained end-to-end or used to extract pre-trained features for images and sketches. However, CNNs are limited in modeling the global structural information of objects due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations. To this end, we propose a Transformer-based approach called Three-Way Vision Transformer (TVT) to leverage the ability of Vision Transformer (ViT) to model global contexts due to the global self-attention mechanism. Going beyond simply applying ViT to this task, we propose a token-based strategy of adding fusion and distillation tokens and making them complementary to each other. Specifically, we integrate three ViTs, which are pre-trained on data of each modality, into a three-way pipeline through the processes of distillation and multi-modal hypersphere learning. The distillation process is proposed to supervise fusion ViT (ViT with an extra fusion token) with soft targets from modality-specific ViTs, which prevents fusion ViT from catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, our method learns a multi-modal hypersphere by performing inter- and intra-modal alignment without loss of uniformity, which aims to bridge the modal gap between modalities of sketch and image and avoid the collapse in dimensions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Sketchy, TU-Berlin, and QuickDraw, demonstrate the superiority of our TVT method over the state-of-the-art ZS-SBIR methods."}

Numerous methods for this task focus on utilizing the predictions of unlabeled instances consistency alone to regularize networks. However, treating labeled and unlabeled data separately often leads to the discarding of mass prior knowledge learned from the labeled examples.  In this paper, we propose a novel method for semi-supervised semantic segmentation named GuidedMix-Net, by leveraging labeled information to guide the learning of unlabeled instances. Specifically, GuidedMix-Net employs three operations: 1) interpolation of similar labeled-unlabeled image pairs; 2) transfer of mutual information; 3) generalization of pseudo masks. It enables segmentation models can learning the higher-quality pseudo masks of unlabeled data by transfer the knowledge from labeled samples to unlabeled data. Along with supervised learning for labeled data, the prediction of unlabeled data is jointly learned with the generated pseudo masks from the mixed data.  Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, and Cityscapes demonstrate the effectiveness of our GuidedMix-Net, which achieves competitive segmentation accuracy and significantly improves the mIoU over 7$%$ compared to previous approaches."}

However, most previous works focus on hiding the objects from the detector by generating an individual adversarial patch, which only covers the planar part of the vehicle’s surface and fails to attack the detector in physical scenarios for multi-view, long-distance and partially occluded objects. To bridge the gap between digital attacks and physical attacks, we exploit the full 3D vehicle surface to propose a robust Full-coverage Camouflage Attack (FCA) to fool detectors. Specifically, we first try rendering the nonplanar camouflage texture over the full vehicle surface. To mimic the real-world environment conditions, we then introduce a transformation function to transfer the rendered camouflaged vehicle into a photo-realistic scenario. Finally, we design an efficient loss function to optimize the camouflage texture. Experiments show that the full-coverage camouflage attack can not only outperform state-of-the-art methods under various test cases but also generalize to different environments, vehicles, and object detectors."}

However, is the attention mechanism truly an indispensable part of ViT? Can it be replaced by some other alternatives? To demystify the role of attention mechanism, we simplify it into an extremely simple case: ZERO FLOP and ZERO parameter. Concretely, we revisit the shift operation. It does not contain any parameter or arithmetic calculation. The only operation is to exchange a small portion of the channels between neighboring features. Based on this simple operation, we construct a new backbone network, namely ShiftViT, where the attention layers in ViT are substituted by shift operations. Surprisingly, ShiftViT works quite well in several mainstream tasks, e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation. The performance is on par with or even better than the strong baseline Swin Transformer. These results suggest that the attention mechanism might not be the vital factor that makes ViT successful. It can be even replaced by a zero-parameter operation. We should pay more attentions to the remaining parts of ViT in the future work. Code is available at github.com/microsoft/SPACH."}

One can observe that deployments of multi-exit architectures on resource-constrained devices are easily limited by high memory footprint of early modules. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named recurrent aggregation operator (ReX), which uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to effectively aggregate intra-patch features within a large receptive field to get delicate local representations, while bypassing large early activations. The resulting model, named ReXNet, can be easily extended to dynamic inference by introducing a novel consistency-based early exit criteria, which is based on the consistency of classification decisions over several modules, rather than the entropy of the prediction distribution.

For a small batch of images initially sampled with pixel-wise annotations, we employ panoptic information to initially select unlabeled samples. Considering the class imbalance in the segmentation dataset, we import a Regional Gaussian Attention module (RGA) to achieve semantics-biased selection. The subset is highlighted by vote entropy and then attended by Gaussian kernels to maximize the biased regions. We also propose a Contextual Labels Extension (CLE) to boost regional annotations with contextual attention guidance. With the collaboration of semantics-agnostic panoptic matching and region-biased selection and extension, our CPRAL can strike a balance between labeling efforts and performance and compromise the semantics distribution.

The framework is based on an encoder-decoder network, which can be trained on large natural image datasets and does not require ground truth fusion images. We design three self-supervised reconstruction tasks according to the characteristics of multi-exposure images and conduct these tasks simultaneously using multi-task learning; through this process, the network can learn the characteristics of multi-exposure images and extract more generalized features. In addition, to compensate for the defect in establishing long-range dependencies in CNN-based architectures, we design an encoder that combines a CNN module with a transformer module. This combination enables the network to focus on both local and global information. We evaluated our method and compared it to 11 competitive traditional and deep learning-based methods on the latest released multi-exposure image fusion benchmark dataset, and our method achieved the best performance in both subjective and objective evaluations.

Existing unsupervised methods, though mine useful clusters or features, require some annotated samples to facilitate the final task-specific predictions. This defeats the true purpose of unsupervised learning and hence we envisage a paradigm of `true' self-supervision, where absolutely no annotated instances are used for training a classifier. The proposed method first pretrains a deep network through self-supervision and performs clustering on the learned features. A classifier layer is then appended to the self-supervised network and is trained by matching the distribution of the predictions to that of a predefined prior. This approach leverages the distribution of labels for supervisory signals and consequently, no image-label pair is needed. Experiments reveal that the method works on major nominal as well as ordinal classification datasets and delivers significant performance."}

Making the two views distinctive is a core to guarantee that unsupervised methods can learn meaningful information. However, such frameworks are sometimes fragile on overfitting if the augmentations used for generating two views are not strong enough, causing the over-confident issue on the training data. This drawback hinders the model from learning subtle variance and fine-grained information. To address this, in this work we aim to involve the soft distance concept on label space in the contrastive-based unsupervised learning task and let the model be aware of the soft degree of similarity between positive or negative pairs through mixing the input data space, to further work collaboratively for the input and loss spaces. Despite its conceptual simplicity, we show empirically that with the solution -- Unsupervised image mixtures (Un-Mix), we can learn subtler, more robust and generalized representations from the transformed input and corresponding new label space. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Tiny ImageNet and standard ImageNet-1K with popular unsupervised methods SimCLR, BYOL, MoCo V1&V2, SwAV, etc. Our proposed image mixture and label assignment strategy can obtain consistent improvement by 1~3% following exactly the same hyperparameters and training procedures of the base methods.

This paper presents a novel approach to parse 3D part mobility from point cloud sequences. The key innovation is learning explicit point correspondence from a raw unordered point cloud sequence. We propose a novel deep network called P^3-Net to parallelize trajectory feature extraction and point correspondence establishment, performing joint optimization between them. Specifically, we design a Match-LSTM module to reaggregate point features among different frames by a point correspondence matrix, a.k.a. the matching matrix. To obtain this matrix, an attention module is proposed to calculate the point correspondence. Moreover, we implement a Gumbel-Sinkhorn module to reduce the many-to-one relationship for better point correspondence. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, including the motion dataset and the PartNet dataset. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms SOTA methods on various 3D parsing tasks of part mobility, including motion flow prediction, motion part segmentation, and motion attribute (i.e. axis & range) estimation. Moreover, we integrate our approach into a robot perception module to validate its robustness."}

Most existing prototype-based approaches only exploit the prototype from the support feature and ignore the information from the query sample, failing to remove this obstacle.In this paper, we proposes a dual prototype network (DPNet) to dispose of few shot semantic segmentation from a new perspective. Along with the prototype extracted from the support set, we propose to build the pseudo-prototype based on foreground features in the query image. To achieve this goal, the cycle comparison module is developed to select reliable foreground features and generate the pseudo-prototype with them. Then, a prototype interaction module is utilized to integrate the information of the prototype and the pseudo-prototype based on their underlying correlation. Finally, a multi-scale fusion module is introduced to capture contextual information during the dense comparison between prototype (pseudo-prototype) and query feature. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmarks demonstrate that our method exceeds previous state-of-the-arts with a sizable margin, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

While methods that use style-based GANs can generate strikingly photorealistic face images, it is often difficult to control the characteristics of the generated faces in a meaningful and disentangled way. Prior approaches aim to achieve such semantic control and disentanglement within the latent space of a previously trained GAN. In contrast, we propose a framework that a priori models physical attributes of the face such as 3D shape, albedo, pose, and lighting explicitly, thus providing disentanglement by design. Our method, MOST-GAN, integrates the expressive power and photorealism of style-based GANs with the physical disentanglement and flexibility of nonlinear 3D morphable models, which we couple with a state-of-the-art 2D hair manipulation network. MOST-GAN achieves photorealistic manipulation of portrait images with fully disentangled 3D control over their physical attributes, enabling extreme manipulation of lighting, facial expression, and pose variations up to full profile view."}

{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2022", "Area": "AI", "Where": "AAAI", "Abbreviation": "Less Is More", "Title": "Pay Less Attention in Vision Transformers", "Abstract": "Transformers have become one of the dominant architectures in deep learning, particularly as a powerful alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision. However, Transformer training and inference in previous works can be prohibitively expensive due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention over a long sequence of representations, especially for high-resolution dense prediction tasks. To this end, we present a novel Less attention vIsion Transformer (LIT), building upon the fact that the early self-attention layers in Transformers still focus on local patterns and bring minor benefits in recent hierarchical vision Transformers. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical Transformer where we use pure multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to encode rich local patterns in the early stages while applying self-attention modules to capture longer dependencies in deeper layers. Moreover, we further propose a learned deformable token merging module to adaptively fuse informative patches in a non-uniform manner. The proposed LIT achieves promising performance on image recognition tasks, including image classification, object detection and instance segmentation, serving as a strong backbone for many vision tasks.

Previous methods either exploit audio-visual representation learning or leverage intermediate structural information such as landmarks and 3D models. However, they struggle to synthesize fine details of the lips varying at the phoneme level as they do not sufficiently provide visual information of the lips at the video synthesis step. To overcome this limitation, our work proposes Audio-Lip Memory that brings in visual information of the mouth region corresponding to input audio and enforces fine-grained audio-visual coherence. It stores lip motion features from sequential ground truth images in the value memory and aligns them with corresponding audio features so that they can be retrieved using audio input at inference time. Therefore, using the retrieved lip motion features as visual hints, it can easily correlate audio with visual dynamics in the synthesis step. By analyzing the memory, we demonstrate that unique lip features are stored in each memory slot at the phoneme level, capturing subtle lip motion based on memory addressing. In addition, we introduce visual-visual synchronization loss which can enhance lip-syncing performance when used along with audio-visual synchronization loss in our model. Extensive experiments are performed to verify that our method generates high-quality video with mouth shapes that best align with the input audio, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods."}

To make our method general, we tackle two applied scenarios, i.e. , deep classification and deep metric learning. Under the long-tailed data distribution, the most classes (i.e., tail classes) only occupy relatively few samples and are prone to lack of within-class diversity. A radical solution is to augment the tail classes with higher diversity. To this end, we introduce a simple and reliable method named Memory-based Jitter (MBJ). We observe that during training, the deep model constantly changes its parameters after every iteration, yielding the phenomenon of weight jitters. Consequentially, given a same image as the input, two historical editions of the model generate two different features in the deeply-embedded space, resulting in feature jitters. Using a memory bank, we collect these (model or feature) jitters across multiple training iterations and get the so-called Memory-based Jitter. The accumulated jitters enhance the within-class diversity for the tail classes and consequentially improves long-tailed visual recognition. With slight modifications, MBJ is applicable for two fundamental visual recognition tasks, i.e., deep image classification and deep metric learning (on long-tailed data). Extensive experiments on five long-tailed classification benchmarks and two deep metric learning benchmarks demonstrate significant improvement. Moreover, the achieved performance are on par with the state of the art on both tasks."}

It has three stages: transformer pre-training, zero-shot restoration, and hard patch refinement. Using the pre-trained transformers, our model is able to tell the motion difference between the true image information and the obstructing elements. For zero-shot image restoration, we design a novel model, termed SiamTrans, which is constructed by Siamese transformers, encoders, and decoders. Each transformer has a temporal attention layer and several self-attention layers, to capture both temporal and spatial information of multiple frames. Only self-supervisedly pre-trained on the denoising task, SiamTrans is tested on three different low-level vision tasks (deraining, demoireing, and desnowing). Compared with related methods, SiamTrans achieves the best performances, even outperforming those with supervised learning."}

Given an arbitrary textual search query, Open-vocabulary Visual Instance Search (OVIS) aims to return a ranked list of visual instances, i.e., image patches, that satisfies the search intent from an image database. The term ``open vocabulary'' means that there are neither restrictions to the visual instance to be searched nor restrictions to the word that can be used to compose the textual search query. We propose to address such a search challenge via visual-semantic aligned representation learning (ViSA). ViSA leverages massive image-caption pairs as weak image-level (not instance-level) supervision to learn a rich cross-modal semantic space where the representations of visual instances (not images) and those of textual queries are aligned, thus allowing us to measure the similarities between any visual instance and an arbitrary textual query. To evaluate the performance of ViSA, we build two datasets named OVIS40 and OVIS1600 and also introduce a pipeline for error analysis. Through extensive experiments on the two datasets, we demonstrate ViSA's ability to search for visual instances in images not available during training given a wide range of textual queries including those composed of uncommon words. Experimental results show that ViSA achieves an mAP@50 of 27.8% on OVIS40 and achieves a recall@30 of 21.3% on OVIS1400 dataset under the most challenging settings."}

Recent work has achieved promising performances by using deep descriptors. They generally take all deep descriptors from neural networks into consideration while ignoring that some of them are useless in classification due to their limited receptive field, e.g., task-irrelevant descriptors could be misleading and multiple aggregative descriptors from background clutter could even overwhelm the object's presence. In this paper, we argue that a Mutual Nearest Neighbor (MNN) relation should be established to explicitly select the query descriptors that are most relevant to each task and discard less relevant ones from aggregative clutters in FSL. Specifically, we propose Discriminative Mutual Nearest Neighbor Neural Network (DMN4) for FSL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-arts on both fine-grained and generalized datasets."}

Besides recognizing predefined classes, the system needs to reject the unknowns. Prototype learning is a potential manner to handle the problem, as its ability to improve intra-class compactness of representations is much needed in discrimination between the known and the unknowns. In this work, we propose a novel Prototype Mining And Learning (PMAL) framework. It has a prototype mining mechanism before the phase of optimizing embedding space, explicitly considering two crucial properties, namely high-quality and diversity of the prototype set. Concretely, a set of high-quality candidates are firstly extracted from training samples based on data uncertainty learning, avoiding the interference from unexpected noise. Considering the multifarious appearance of objects even in a single category, a diversity-based strategy for prototype set filtering is proposed. Accordingly, the embedding space can be better optimized to discriminate therein the predefined classes and between known and unknowns. Extensive experiments verify the two good characteristics (i.e., high-quality and diversity) embraced in prototype mining, and show the remarkable performance of the proposed framework compared to state-of-the-arts."}

We analyze in depth the behavior of a state-of-the-art semi-supervised method, FixMatch, which relies on a weakly-augmented version of an image to obtain supervision signal for a more strongly-augmented version. We show that it frequently fails in barely-supervised scenarios, due to a lack of training signal when no pseudo-label can be predicted with high confidence. We propose a method to leverage self-supervised methods that provides training signal in the absence of confident pseudo-labels. We then propose two methods to refine the pseudo-label selection process which lead to further improvements.The first one relies on a per-sample history of the model predictions, akin to a voting scheme. The second iteratively up-dates class-dependent confidence thresholds to better explore classes that are under-represented in the pseudo-labels. Our experiments show that our approach performs significantly better on STL-10 in the barely-supervised regime,e.g. with 4 or 8 labeled images per class."}

However, due to the growing privacy awareness, it is prohibited to access the face images on user devices to continually improve face recognition models. Federated Learning (FL) is a technique to address the privacy issue, which can collaboratively optimize the model without sharing the data between clients. In this work, we propose a FL based framework called FedFR to improve the generic face representation in a privacy-aware manner. Besides, the framework jointly optimizes personalized models for the corresponding clients via the proposed Decoupled Feature Customization module. The client-specific personalized model can serve the need of optimized face recognition experience for registered identities at the local device. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the personalized face recognition in FL setup.

In image recognition tasks, the best results are achieved by SNN so far utilizing ANN-SNN conversion methods that replace activation functions in artificial neural networks~(ANNs) with integrate-and-fire neurons. Compared to source ANNs, converted SNNs usually suffer from accuracy loss and require a considerable number of time steps to achieve competitive accuracy. We find that the performance degradation of converted SNN stems from the fact that the information capacity of spike trains in transferred networks is smaller than that of activation values in source ANN, resulting in less information being passed during SNN inference.    To better correlate ANN and SNN for better performance, we propose a conversion framework to mitigate the gap between the activation value of source ANN and the generated spike train of target SNN. The conversion framework originates from exploring an identical relation in the conversion and exploits temporal separation scheme and novel neuron model for the relation to hold. We demonstrate almost lossless ANN-SNN conversion using SpikeConverter for VGG-16, ResNet-20/34, and MobileNet-v2 SNNs on challenging datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Our results also show that SpikeConverter achieves the abovementioned accuracy across different network architectures and datasets using 32X - 512X fewer inference time-steps than state-of-the-art ANN-SNN conversion methods."}

Experiments in un- and semi-supervised learning settings on STR benchmarks demonstrate our proposed framework can yield a more robust representation for both CTC-based and attention-based decoders than other contrastive learning methods. To fully investigate the potential of our method, we also collect a dataset of 100 million unlabeled text images, named UTI-100M, covering 5 scenes and 4 languages. By leveraging hundred-million-level unlabeled data, our PerSec shows significant performance improvement when fine-tuning the learned representation on the labeled data.

However, most real-world FR systems tend to operate at a pre-defined False Accept Rate (FAR), and the corresponding True Accept Rate (TAR) represents the performance of the FR systems, which indicates that the optimization on the pre-defined FAR is more meaningful and important in the practical evaluation process. In this paper, we call the predefined FAR as Anchor FAR, and we argue that the existing FR loss functions cannot guarantee the optimal TAR under the Anchor FAR, which impedes further improvements of FR systems. To this end, we propose AnchorFace to bridge the aforementioned gap between the training and practical evaluation process for FR. Given the Anchor FAR, AnchorFace can boost the performance of FR systems by directly optimizing the non-differentiable FR evaluation metrics. Specifically, in AnchorFace, we first calculate the similarities of the positive and negative pairs based on both the features of the current batch and the stored features in the maintained online-updating set. Then, we generate the differentiable TAR loss and FAR loss using a soften strategy. Our AnchorFace can be readily integrated into most existing FR loss functions, and extensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AnchorFace."}

However, current one-shot trackers solely rely on single-frame detections to predict candidate bounding boxes, which may be unreliable when facing disastrous visual degradation, e.g., motion blur, occlusions. Once a target bounding box is mistakenly classified as background by the detector, the temporal consistency of its corresponding tracklet will be no longer maintained. In this paper, we set out to restore the bounding boxes misclassified as ``fake background'' by proposing a re-check network. The re-check network innovatively expands the role of ID embedding from data association to motion forecasting by effectively propagating previous tracklets to the current frame with a small overhead. Note that the propagation results are yielded by an independent and efficient embedding search, preventing the model from over-relying on detection results. Eventually, it helps to reload the ``fake background'' and repair the broken tracklets. Building on a strong baseline CSTrack, we construct a new one-shot tracker and achieve favorable gains by 70.7  76.4, 70.6  76.3 MOTA on MOT16 and MOT17, respectively.

Unlike existing works which require the point cloud to be segmented into parts a priori, our parts-aware editing and generation are performed in an unsupervised manner. We achieve this with a simple modification of the Variational Auto-Encoder which yields a joint model of the point cloud itself along with a schematic representation of it as a combination of shape primitives. In particular, we introduce a latent representation of the point cloud which can be decomposed into a disentangled representation for each part of the shape. These parts are in turn disentangled into both a shape primitive and a point cloud representation, along with a standardising transformation to a canonical coordinate system. The dependencies between our standardising transformations preserve the spatial dependencies between the parts in a manner that allows meaningful parts-aware point cloud generation and shape editing. In addition to the flexibility afforded by our disentangled representation, the inductive bias introduced by our joint modeling approach yields state-of-the-art experimental results on the ShapeNet dataset."}

The majority of current approaches follow the metric learning paradigm, which learns to compare the similarity between videos. Recently, it has been observed that directly measuring this similarity is not ideal since different action instances may show distinctive temporal distribution, resulting in severe misalignment issues across query and support videos. In this paper, we arrest this problem from two distinct aspects -- action duration misalignment and action evolution misalignment. We address them sequentially through a Two-stage Action Alignment Network (TA2N). The first stage locates the action by learning a temporal affine transform, which warps each video feature to its action duration while dismissing the action-irrelevant feature (e.g. background). Next, the second stage coordinates query feature to match the spatial-temporal action evolution of support by performing temporally rearrange and spatially offset prediction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the potential of the proposed method in achieving state-of-the-art performance for few-shot action recognition."}

Most existing works bridge the domain gap by minimizing the domain discrepancy in the category space and aligning category-agnostic global features. Though great success, these methods model domain discrepancy with prototypes within a batch, yielding a biased estimation of domain-level distribution. Besides, the category-agnostic alignment leads to the disagreement of class-specific distributions in the two domains, further causing inevitable classification errors. To overcome these two challenges, we propose a novel Semantic Conditioned AdaptatioN (SCAN) framework such that well-modeled unbiased semantics can support semantic conditioned adaptation for precise domain adaptive object detection. Specifically, class-specific semantics crossing different images in the source domain are graphically aggregated as the input to learn an unbiased semantic paradigm incrementally. The paradigm is then sent to a lightweight manifestation module to obtain conditional kernels to serve as the role of extracting semantics from the target domain for better adaptation. Subsequently, conditional kernels are integrated into global alignment to support the class-specific adaptation in a well-designed Conditional Kernel guided Alignment (CKA) module. Meanwhile, rich knowledge of the unbiased paradigm is transferred to the target domain with a novel Graph-based Semantic Transfer (GST) mechanism, yielding the adaptation in the category-based feature space. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three adaptation benchmarks demonstrate that SCAN outperforms existing works by a large margin."}

Image deraining is a classic low-level restoration task, while image segmentation is a typical high-level understanding task. Most of the existing methods intuitively employ the bottom-up paradigm by taking deraining as a preprocessing step for subsequent segmentation. However, our statistical analysis indicates that not only deraining would benefit segmentation (bottom-up), but also segmentation would further improve deraining performance (top-down) in turn. This motivates us to solve the rainy image segmentation task within a novel top-down and bottom-up unified paradigm, in which two sub-tasks are alternatively performed and collaborated with each other. Specifically, the bottom-up procedure yields both clearer images and rain-robust features from both image and feature domains, so as to ease the segmentation ambiguity caused by rain streaks. The top-down procedure adopts semantics to adaptively guide the restoration for different contents via a novel multi-path semantic attentive module (SAM). Thus the deraining and segmentation could boost the performance of each other cooperatively and progressively. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art on rainy image segmentation."}

It aims to forecast both upcoming actions and paths of all agents in a scene based on their past activities, which can be jointly formulated by a probabilistic model over time. Learning this model is challenging because: 1) it has a large number of time-dependent variables that must scale with the forecast horizon and the number of agents; 2) distribution functions have to contain multiple modes in order to capture the spatio-temporal complexities of each agent's activities. To address these challenges, we put forth a novel Energy-based Learning approach for Multi-Agent activity forecasting (ELMA) to estimate this complex model via maximum log-likelihood estimation. Specifically, by sampling from a sequence of factorized marginalized multi-model distributions, ELMA generates most possible future actions efficiently.

One can make the prior distribution of these symbols a design choice. The recent IR-Net of Qin et al. argues that imposing a Bernoulli distribution with equal priors (equal bit ratios) over the binary weights leads to maximum entropy and thus minimizes information loss. However, prior work cannot precisely control the binary weight distribution during training, and therefore cannot guarantee maximum entropy. Here, we show that quantizing using optimal transport can guarantee any bit ratio, including equal ratios. We investigate experimentally that equal bit ratios are indeed preferable and show that our method leads to optimization benefits. We show that our quantization method is effective when compared to state-of-the-art binarization methods, even when using binary weight pruning.

However, most of the methods are generally designed on the RGB image domain. Due to the discrepancy between the two-dimensional image plane and the three-dimensional space, such pre-trained models fail to perceive spatial information and serve as sub-optimal solutions for 3D-related tasks. To bridge this gap, we aim to learn a spatial-aware visual representation that can describe the three-dimensional space and is more suitable and effective for these tasks. To leverage point clouds, which are much more superior in providing spatial information compared to images, we propose a simple yet effective 2D Image and 3D Point cloud Unsupervised pre-training strategy, called SimIPU. Specifically, we develop a multi-modal contrastive learning framework that consists of an intra-modal spatial perception module to learn a spatial-aware representation from point clouds and an inter-modal feature interaction module to transfer the capability of perceiving spatial information from the point cloud encoder to the image encoder, respectively. Positive pairs for contrastive losses are established by the matching algorithm and the projection matrix. The whole framework is trained in an unsupervised end-to-end fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore contrastive learning pre-training strategies for outdoor multi-modal datasets, containing paired camera images and LIDAR point clouds."}

Limited by the definition of AP, such methods consider both negative and positive instances ranking before each positive instance. However, we claim that only penalizing negative instances before positive ones is enough, because the loss only comes from these negative instances. To this end, we propose a novel loss, namely Penalizing Negative instances before Positive ones (PNP),  which can directly minimize the number of negative instances before each positive one. In addition, AP-based methods adopt a fixed and sub-optimal gradient assignment strategy. Therefore, we systematically investigate different gradient assignment solutions via constructing derivative functions of the loss, resulting in PNP-I with increasing derivative functions and PNP-D with decreasing ones. PNP-I focuses more on the hard positive instances by assigning larger gradients to them and tries to make all relevant instances closer. In contrast,  PNP-D pays less attention to such instances and slowly corrects them. For most real-world data, one class usually contains several local clusters. PNP-I blindly gathers these clusters while PNP-D keeps them as they were. Therefore, PNP-D is more superior. Experiments on three standard retrieval datasets show consistent results with the above analysis. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PNP-D achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Estimating 3D motions for point clouds is challenging, since a point cloud is unordered and its density is significantly non-uniform. Such unstructured data poses difficulties in matching corresponding points between point clouds, leading to inaccurate flow estimation. We propose a novel architecture named Sparse Convolution-Transformer Network (SCTN) that equips the sparse convolution with the transformer. Specifically, by leveraging the sparse convolution, SCTN transfers irregular point cloud into locally consistent flow features for estimating spatially consistent motions within an object/local object part. We further propose to explicitly learn point relations using a point transformer module, different from exiting methods. We show that the learned relation-based contextual information is rich and helpful for matching corresponding points, benefiting scene flow estimation. In addition, a novel loss function is proposed to adaptively encourage flow consistency according to feature similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves a new state of the art in scene flow estimation. Our approach achieves an error of 0.038 and 0.037 (EPE3D) on FlyingThings3D and KITTI Scene Flow respectively, which significantly outperforms previous methods by large margins."}

Previous works treat this task as sequence generation, however, it is challenging to render a music-aligned long-term sequence with high kinematic complexity and coherent movements. In this paper, we reformulate it by a two-stage process, i.e., a key pose generation and then an in-between parametric motion curve prediction, where the key poses are easier to be synchronized with the music beats and the parametric curves can be efficiently regressed to render fluent rhythm-aligned movements. We named the proposed method as DanceFormer, which includes two cascading kinematics-enhanced transformer-guided networks (called DanTrans) that tackle each stage, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale music conditioned 3D dance dataset, called PhantomDance, that is accurately labeled by experienced animators rather than reconstruction or motion capture. This dataset also encodes dances as key poses and parametric motion curves apart from pose sequences, thus benefiting the training of our DanceFormer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, even trained by existing datasets, can generate fluent, performative, and music-matched 3D dances that surpass previous works quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, the proposed DanceFormer, together with the PhantomDance dataset, are seamlessly compatible with industrial animation software, thus facilitating the adaptation for various downstream applications."}

Introducing other modalities such as depth and infrared data is an effective way to handle imaging limitations of individual sources, but multi-modal imaging platforms usually require elaborate designs and cannot be applied in many real-world applications at present. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging becomes an essential part of many surveillance cameras, whose imaging is switchable between RGB and NIR based on the light intensity. These two modalities are heterogeneous with very different visual properties and thus bring big challenges for visual tracking. However, existing works have not studied this challenging problem. In this work, we address the cross-modal object tracking problem and contribute a new video dataset, including 654 cross-modal image sequences with over 481K frames in total, and the average video length is more than 735 frames. To promote the research and development of cross-modal object tracking, we propose a new algorithm, which learns the modality-aware target representation to mitigate the appearance gap between RGB and NIR modalities in the tracking process. It is plug-and-play and could thus be flexibly embedded into different tracking frameworks. Extensive experiments on the dataset are conducted, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in two representative tracking frameworks against 19 state-of-the-art tracking methods.

Our key insight is that the language descriptor should serve as target-specific guidance to identify the target object, while a direct feature fusion of image and language can increase feature complexity and thus may be sub-optimal for RVOS. To this end, we propose a meta-transfer module, which is trained in a learning-to-learn fashion and aims to transfer the target-specific information from the language domain to the image domain, while discarding the uncorrelated complex variations of language description. To bridge the gap between the image and language domains, we develop a multi-scale cross-modal feature mining block that aggregates all the essential features required by RVOS from both domains and generates regression labels for the meta-transfer module.

Recent work achieves promising performance by optimizing the Intersection over Union (IoU). However, IoU-based loss has the gradient vanish problem in the case of low overlapping bounding boxes, and the model could easily ignore these simple cases. In this paper, we propose Side Overlap (SO) loss by maximizing the side overlap of two bounding boxes, which puts more penalty for low overlapping bounding box cases. Besides, to speed up the convergence, the Corner Distance (CD) is added into the objective function. Combining the Side Overlap and Corner Distance, we get a new regression objective function, Side and Corner Align Loss (SCALoss). The SCALoss is well-correlated with IoU loss, which also benefits the evaluation metric but produces more penalty for low-overlapping cases. It can serve as a comprehensive similarity measure, leading to better localization performance and faster convergence speed. Experiments on COCO, PASCAL VOC, and LVIS benchmarks show that SCALoss can bring consistent improvement and outperform ln loss and IoU based loss with popular object detectors such as YOLOV3, SSD, Faster-RCNN.

However, it is not easy to devise an effective cross-modal fusion structure due to the variations of feature dimensions and semantics, especially when the inputs even come from different sensors, as in the field of audio-visual learning. In this work, we propose SepFusion, a novel framework that can smoothly produce optimal fusion structures for visual-sound separation. The framework is composed of two components, namely the model generator and the evaluator. To construct the generator, we devise a lightweight architecture space that can adapt to different input modalities. In this way, we can easily obtain audio-visual fusion structures according to our demands. For the evaluator, we adopt the idea of neural architecture search to select superior networks effectively. This automatic process can significantly save human efforts while achieving competitive performances. Moreover, since our SepFusion provides a series of strong models, we can utilize the model family for broader applications, such as further promoting performance via model assembly, or providing suitable architectures for the separation of certain instrument classes. These potential applications further enhance the competitiveness of our approach."}

This topic has received increased attention in recent years through refinement of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs); however, most existing works are limited to single-round interaction, which is not reflective of real world interactive image editing workflows. Furthermore, previous works dealing with multi-round scenarios are limited to predefined feedback sequences, which is also impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Text-based Interactive image generation and manipulation (TiGAN) that responds to users' natural-language feedback.   TiGAN utilizes the powerful pre-trained CLIP model to understand users' natural-language feedback and exploits contrastive learning for a better text-to-image mapping. To maintain the image consistency during interactions, TiGAN generates intermediate feature vectors aligned with the feedback and selectively feeds these vectors to our proposed generative model. Empirical results on several datasets show that TiGAN improves both interaction efficiency and image quality while better avoids undesirable image manipulation during interactions."}

It is designed to leverage massive online videos for unsupervised training, needless of 3D annotations or motion-body pairing information. The proposed method is built upon two novel canonicalization operations, structure canonicalization and view canonicalization. Trained with the canonicalization operations and the derived regularizations, our method learns to factorize a skeleton sequence into three independent semantic subspaces, i.e., motion, structure, and view angle. The disentangled representation enables motion retargeting from 2D to 3D with high precision. Our method achieves superior performance on motion transfer benchmarks with large body variations and challenging actions. Notably, the canonicalized skeleton sequence could serve as a disentangled and interpretable representation of human motion that benefits action analysis and motion retrieval."}

Specifically, we combine the convolution kernels with different dilations to extend the receptive field in the equirectangular projection. Meanwhile, we introduce an adaptive channel-wise fusion module to summarize the feature maps and get diverse attention areas in the receptive field along the channels. Due to the utilization of channel-wise attention in constructing the adaptive channel-wise fusion module, the network can capture and leverage the cross-channel contextual information efficiently.

It shows excellent performance in a wide range of image manipulation tasks. However, SinGAN has some limitations. Firstly, due to lack of semantic information, SinGAN cannot handle the object images well as it does on the scene and texture images. Secondly, the independent progressive training scheme is time-consuming and easy to cause artifacts accumulation. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we dig into the single image generation problem and improve SinGAN by fully-utilization of internal and external priors. The main contributions of this paper include: 1) We interpret single image generation from the perspective of the general generative task, that is, to learn a diverse distribution from the Dirac distribution composed of a single image. In order to solve this non-trivial problem, we construct a regularized latent variable model to formulate SIG. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to give a clear formulation and optimization goal of SIG, and all the existing methods for SIG can be regarded as special cases of this model. 2) We design a novel Prior-based end-to-end training GAN (PetsGAN), which is infused with internal prior and external prior to overcome the problems of SinGAN. For one thing, we employ the pre-trained GAN model to inject external prior for image generation, which can alleviate the problem of lack of semantic information and generate natural, reasonable and diverse samples, even for the object image. For another, we fully-utilize the internal prior by a differential Patch Matching module and an effective reconstruction network to generate consistent and realistic texture. 3) We construct abundant of qualitative and quantitative experiments on three datasets. The experimental results show our method surpasses other methods on both generated image quality, diversity, and training speed. Moreover, we apply our method to other image manipulation tasks (e.g., style transfer, harmonization) and the results further prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our method."}

We find that the block aggregation function plays a critical role in enabling cross-block non-local information communication. This observation leads us to design a simplified architecture that requires minor code changes upon the original vision transformer. The benefits of the proposed judiciously-selected design are threefold:  (1) NesT converges faster and requires much less training data to achieve good generalization on both ImageNet and small datasets like CIFAR; (2) when extending our key ideas to image generation, NesT leads to a strong decoder that is 8 times faster than previous transformer-based generators; and (3) we show that decoupling the feature learning and abstraction processes via this nested hierarchy in our design enables constructing a novel method (named GradCAT) for visually interpreting the learned model.

In SOIT, multiple queries are learned to directly reason a set of object embeddings of semantic category, bounding-box location, and pixel-wise mask in parallel under the global image context. The class and bounding-box can be easily embedded by a fixed-length vector. The pixel-wise mask, especially, is embedded by a group of parameters to construct a lightweight instance-aware transformer.

Various schemes have been proposed to tackle this challenging problem, where the patch-based approaches are shown to be promising. However, the existing patch-based approaches tend to treat different patches equally, which do not fully exploit the patch discrepancy for effective feature learning. In this paper, we propose a Patch Diffusion (PD) module which can be integrated into the existing face manipulation detection networks to boost the performance. The PD consists of Discrepancy Patch Feature Learning (DPFL) and Attention-Aware Message Passing (AMP). The DPFL effectively learns the patch features by a newly designed Pairwise Patch Loss (PPLoss), which takes both the patch importance and correlations into consideration. The AMP diffuses the patches through attention-aware message passing in a graph network, where the attentions are explicitly computed based on the patch features learnt in DPFL. We integrate our PD module into four recent face manipulation detection networks, and carry out the experiments on four popular datasets. The results demonstrate that our PD module is able to boost the performance of the existing networks for face manipulation detection."}

The key challenge lies in how to measure image-text relevance accurately as matching evidence. Most existing works aggregate the local semantic similarities of matched region-word pairs as the overall relevance, and they typically assume that the matched pairs are equally reliable. However, although a region-word pair is locally matched across modalities, it may be inconsistent/unreliable from the global perspective of image-text, resulting in inaccurate relevance measurement. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Confidence-Aware Network to infer the matching confidence that indicates the reliability of matched region-word pairs, which is combined with the local semantic similarities to refine the relevance measurement. Specifically, we first calculate the matching confidence via the relevance between the semantic of image regions and the complete described semantic in the image, with the text as a bridge. Further, to richly express the region semantics, we extend the region to its visual context in the image. Then, local semantic similarities are weighted with the inferred confidence to filter out unreliable matched pairs in aggregating.

However, this pipeline is redundant and inefficient for the independent processes, and some inner features could have been shared. Therefore, we present an efficient paradigm to perform Simultaneously Image Colorization and Super-resolution (SCS) and propose an end-to-end SCSNet to achieve this goal. The proposed method consists of two parts: colorization branch for learning color information that employs the proposed plug-and-play Pyramid Valve Cross Attention (PVCAttn) module to aggregate feature maps between source and reference images; and super-resolution branch for integrating color and texture information to predict target images, which uses the designed Continuous Pixel Mapping (CPM) module to predict high-resolution images at continuous magnification. Furthermore, our SCSNet supports both automatic and referential modes that is more flexible for practical application. Abundant experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method for generating authentic images over state-of-the-art methods, e.g., averagely decreasing FID by 1.8 and 5.1 compared with current best scores for automatic and referential modes, respectively, while owning fewer parameters (more than x2) and faster running speed (more than x3)."}

Concretely, our framework involves sparse label-appearance encoding, inter-object relation adaptation and intra-object knowledge mapping to obtain the instructive knowledge. They jointly form an implicit teacher at training phase, dynamically dependent on labels and evolving student representations. Modules in LGD are trained end-to-end with student detector and are discarded in inference. Experimentally, LGD obtains decent results on various detectors, datasets, and extensive tasks like instance segmentation. For example in MS-COCO dataset, LGD improves RetinaNet with ResNet-50 under 2x single-scale training from 36.2% to 39.0% mAP (+ 2.8%).

A text-based image intuitively contains abundant and complex multimodal relational content, that is, image details can be described diversely from multiview rather than a single caption. Certainly, we can introduce additional paired training data to show the diversity of images' descriptions, this process is labor-intensive and time-consuming for TextCap pair annotations with extra texts.

The CD task helps the model to learn medical domain knowledge by predicting disease from radiographs. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) words are important semantic components in radiograph reports, and the MMM task helps the model focus on the prediction of MeSH words. The IMM task helps the model learn the alignment of MeSH words with radiographs by matching scores obtained by a two-level sparse attention: region sparse attention and word sparse attention.

Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf segment-level features, which suffer from spatial incompleteness and temporal incoherence, thus limiting their performance. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a new perspective by enhancing segment-level representations with a simple yet effective graph convolutional network, namely action complement graph network (ACGNet). It facilitates the current video segment to perceive spatial-temporal dependencies from others that potentially convey complementary clues, implicitly mitigating the negative effects caused by the two issues above. By this means, the segment-level features are more discriminative and robust to spatial-temporal variations, contributing to higher localization accuracies. More importantly, the proposed ACGNet works as a universal module that can be flexibly plugged into different WTAL frameworks, while maintaining the end-to-end training fashion. Extensive experiments are conducted on the THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet1.2 benchmarks, where the state-of-the-art results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach."}

Towards a compact and efficient pipeline for multi-person pose estimation task, in this paper, we propose to represent the human parts as points and present a novel body representation, which leverages an adaptive point set including the human center and seven human-part related points to represent the human instance in a more fine-grained manner. The novel representation is more capable of capturing the various pose deformation and adaptively factorizes the long-range center-to-joint displacement thus delivers a single-stage differentiable network to more precisely regress multi-person pose, termed as AdaptivePose. For inference, our proposed network eliminates the grouping as well as refinements and only needs a single-step disentangling process to form multi-person pose. Without any bells and whistles, we achieve the best speed-accuracy trade-offs of 67.4% AP / 29.4 fps with DLA-34 and 71.3% AP / 9.1 fps with HRNet-W48 on COCO test-dev dataset."}

In this work, we propose to solve the partial-to-partial registration from a new perspective, by introducing multi-level feature interactions between the source and the reference clouds at the feature extraction stage, such that the registration can be realized without the attentions or explicit mask estimation for the overlapping detection as adopted previously. Specifically, we present FINet, a feature interactionbased structure with the capability to enable and strengthen the information associating between the inputs at multiple stages. To achieve this, we first split the features into two components, one for rotation and one for translation, based on the fact that they belong to different solution spaces, yielding a dual branches structure. Second, we insert several interaction modules at the feature extractor for the data association. Third, we propose a transformation sensitivity loss to obtain rotation-attentive and translation-attentive features. Experiments demonstrate that our method performs higher precision and robustness compared to the state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based methods.

To enhance the model generalization, domain generalization through learning the domain-invariant representation has been widely studied. However, most existing works learn the shared feature space within multi-source domains but ignore the characteristic of the feature itself (e.g., the feature sensitivity to the domain-specific style). Therefore, we propose the Domain-invariant Representation Learning (DIRL) for domain generalization which utilizes the feature sensitivity as the feature prior to guide the enhancement of the model generalization capability. The guidance reflects in two folds: 1) Feature re-calibration that introduces the Prior Guided Attention Module (PGAM) to emphasize the insensitive features and suppress the sensitive features. 2): Feature whiting that proposes the Guided Feature Whiting (GFW) to remove the feature correlations which are sensitive to the domain-specific style. We construct the domain-invariant representation which suppresses the effect of the domain-specific style on the quality and correlation of the features. As a result, our method is simple yet effective, and can enhance the robustness of various backbone networks with little computational cost. Extensive experiments over multiple domains generalizable segmentation tasks show the superiority of our approach to other methods."}

However, due to occlusion and signal miss, LiDAR point clouds are in practice 2.5D as they cover only partial underlying shapes, which poses a fundamental challenge to 3D perception. To tackle the challenge, we present a novel LiDAR-based 3D object detection model, dubbed Behind the Curtain Detector (BtcDet), which learns the object shape priors and estimates the complete object shapes that are partially occluded (curtained) in point clouds. BtcDet first identifies the regions that are affected by occlusion and signal miss. In these regions, our model predicts the probability of occupancy that indicates if a region contains object shapes and integrates this probability map with detection features and generates high-quality 3D proposals. Finally, the occupancy estimation is integrated into the proposal refinement module to generate accurate bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on the KITTI Dataset and the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of BtcDet. Particularly for the 3D detection of both cars and cyclists on the KITTI benchmark, BtcDet surpasses all of the published state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins. Code is released."}

Recent works mainly focus on inference speedup via 2:4 sparsity while training acceleration has been largely overwhelmed where backpropagation consumes around 70% of the training time. However, unlike inference, training speedup with structured pruning is nontrivial due to the need to maintain the fidelity of gradients and reduce the additional overhead of performing 2:4 sparsity online. For the first time, this article proposes fully sparse training (FST) where `fully' indicates that ALL matrix multiplications in forward/backward propagation are structurally pruned while maintaining accuracy. To this end, we begin with saliency analysis, investigating the sensitivity of different sparse objects to structured pruning. Based on the observation of spatial similarity among activations, we propose pruning activations with fixed 2:4 masks. Moreover, an Information Restoration block is proposed to retrieve the lost information, which can be implemented by efficient gradient-shift operation. Evaluation of accuracy and efficiency shows that we can achieve 2× training acceleration with negligible accuracy degradation on challenging large-scale classification and detection tasks."}

Since the computation complexity of ViT is quadratic with respect to the input sequence length, a mainstream paradigm for computation reduction is to reduce the number of tokens. Existing designs include structured spatial compression that uses a progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce the computations of large feature maps, and unstructured token pruning that dynamically drops redundant tokens. However, the limitation of existing token pruning lies in two folds: 1) the incomplete spatial structure caused by pruning is not compatible with structured spatial compression that is commonly used in modern deep-narrow transformers; 2) it usually requires a time-consuming pre-training procedure. To tackle the limitations and expand the applicable scenario of token pruning, we present Evo-ViT, a self-motivated slow-fast token evolution approach for vision transformers. Specifically, we conduct unstructured instance-wise token selection by taking advantage of the simple and effective global class attention that is native to vision transformers. Then, we propose to update the selected informative tokens and uninformative tokens with different computation paths, namely, slow-fast updating. Since slow-fast updating mechanism maintains the spatial structure and information flow, Evo-ViT can accelerate vanilla transformers of both flat and deep-narrow structures from the very beginning of the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the computational cost of vision transformers while maintaining comparable performance on image classification. For example, our method accelerates DeiT-S by over 60% throughput while only sacrificing 0.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, outperforming current token pruning methods on both accuracy and efficiency."}

In this work, we propose a lightweight Identity-aware Dynamic Network (IDN) for subject-agnostic face swapping by dynamically adjusting the model parameters according to the identity information. In particular, we design an efficient Identity Injection Module (IIM) by introducing two dynamic neural network techniques, including the weights prediction and weights modulation. Once the IDN is updated, it can be applied to swap faces given any target image or video. The presented IDN contains only 0.50M parameters and needs 0.33G FLOPs per frame, making it capable for real-time video face swapping on mobile phones. In addition, we introduce a knowledge distillation-based method for stable training, and a loss reweighting module is employed to obtain better synthesized results. Finally, our method achieves comparable results with the teacher models and other state-of-the-art methods."}

In this paper, we propose L-CoDe, a Language-based Colorization network using color-object Decoupled conditions. A predictor for object-color corresponding matrix (OCCM) and a novel attention transfer module (ATM) are introduced to solve the color-object coupling problem. To deal with color-object mismatch that results in incorrect color-object correspondence, we adopt a soft-gated injection module (SIM). We further present a new dataset containing annotated color-object pairs to provide supervisory signals for resolving the coupling problem.

We present a novel deep learning approach in which the representation in the Fourier domain of an astronomical source is learned implicitly using a neural field representation.

However previous tree decoders converted the tree structure labels into a fixed and ordered sequence, which could not make full use of the diversified expression of tree labels. In this study, we propose a novel tree decoder (TDv2) to fully utilize the tree structure labels. Compared with previous tree decoders, this new model does not require a fixed priority for different branches of a node during training and inference, which can effectively improve the model generalization capability. The input and output of the model make full use of the tree structure label, so that there is no need to find the parent node in the decoding process, which simplifies the decoding process and adds a prior information to help predict the node. We verified the effectiveness of each part of the model through comprehensive ablation experiments and attention visualization analysis.

To reduce the quadratic computation complexity caused by the global self-attention, various methods constrain the range of attention within a local region to improve its efficiency. Consequently, their receptive fields in a single attention layer are not large enough, resulting in insufficient context modeling. To address this issue, we propose a Pale-Shaped self-Attention (PS-Attention), which performs self-attention within a pale-shaped region. Compared to the global self-attention, PS-Attention can reduce the computation and memory costs significantly. Meanwhile, it can capture richer contextual information under the similar computation complexity with previous local self-attention mechanisms. Based on the PS-Attention, we develop a general Vision Transformer backbone with a hierarchical architecture, named Pale Transformer, which achieves 83.4%, 84.3%, and 84.9% Top-1 accuracy with the model size of 22M, 48M, and 85M respectively for 224x224 ImageNet-1K classification, outperforming the previous Vision Transformer backbones.

The basic idea is concretized to a novel architecture termed Recurrent Multi-output Network (ReMoNet), which consists of recurrent temporal fusion and temporal aggregation blocks and is further reinforced by similarity-based mutual distillation. We conduct extensive experiments on NVIDIA GPU and Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 mobile platform with Gaussian noise and simulated Image-Signal-Processor (ISP) noise.

It is still challenging for U-Net with a simple skip connection scheme to model the global multi-scale context: 1) Not each skip connection setting is effective due to the issue of incompatible feature sets of encoder and decoder stage, even some skip connection negatively influence the segmentation performance; 2) The original U-Net is worse than the one without any skip connection on some datasets. Based on our findings, we propose a new segmentation framework, named UCTransNet (with a proposed CTrans module in U-Net), from the channel perspective with attention mechanism. Specifically, the CTrans (Channel Transformer) module is an alternate of the U-Net skip connections, which consists of a sub-module to conduct the multi-scale Channel Cross fusion with Transformer (named CCT) and a sub-module Channel-wise Cross-Attention (named CCA) to guide the fused multi-scale channel-wise information to effectively connect to the decoder features for eliminating the ambiguity. Hence, the proposed connection consisting of the CCT and CCA is able to replace the original skip connection to solve the semantic gaps for an accurate automatic medical image segmentation. The experimental results suggest that our UCTransNet produces more precise segmentation performance and achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation across different datasets and conventional architectures involving transformer or U-shaped framework.

These methods usually treat the misclassified and correctly classified pixels equally, hence misleading the optimization process and causing inconsistent intra-class pixel feature representations in the embedding space during learning. In this paper, we propose the auxiliary representation calibration head (RCH), which consists of the image decoupling, prototype clustering, error calibration modules and a metric loss function, to calibrate these error-prone feature representations for better intra-class consistency and segmentation performance. RCH could be incorporated into the hidden layers, trained together with the segmentation networks, and decoupled in the inference stage without additional parameters.

Although some works achieved this by extracting features on cropped parts around face landmarks, landmark detection may be inaccurate or even fail in some extreme cases. Recently, without relying on landmarks, attention-based networks can focus on useful parts automatically. However, there are two issues: 1) It is noticed that these approaches focus on few facial parts, while missing other potentially discriminative regions. This can cause performance drops when emphasized facial parts are invisible under heavy occlusions (e.g. face masks) or large pose variations; 2) Different facial parts may appear at various quality caused by occlusion, blur, or illumination changes. In this paper, we propose contrastive quality-aware attentions, called CQA-Face, to address these two issues. First, a Contrastive Attention Learning (CAL) module is proposed, pushing models to explore comprehensive facial parts. Consequently, more useful parts can help identification if some facial parts are invisible. Second, a Quality-Aware Network (QAN) is developed to emphasize important regions and suppress noisy parts in a global scope. Thus, our CQA-Face model is developed by integrating the CAL with QAN, which extracts diverse quality-aware local representations. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and usefulness."}

Currently, many methods employ RGB-D images to capture the geometric and semantic information of objects. These methods use simple but popular spatial- and channel-wise operations, which fuse the information of RGB and depth data. Yet, they ignore the large discrepancy of RGB-D data and the uncertainty measurements of depth data. To solve this problem, we propose the Frequency Fusion Network (FFNet), a novel method for boosting semantic scene completion by better utilizing RGB-D data. FFNet explicitly correlates the RGB-D data in the frequency domain, different from the features directly extracted by the convolution operation. Then, the network uses the correlated information to guide the feature learning from the RG- B and depth images, respectively. Moreover, FFNet accounts for the properties of different frequency components of RGB- D features. It has a learnable elliptical mask to decompose the features learned from the RGB and depth images, attending to various frequencies to facilitate the correlation process of RGB-D data. We evaluate FFNet intensively on the public SSC benchmarks, where FFNet surpasses the state-of- the-art methods. The code package of FFNet is available at https://github.com/alanWXZ/FFNet."}

In previous transformer-based detectors, the object queries are a set of learned embeddings. However, each learned embedding does not have an explicit physical meaning and we cannot explain where it will focus on. It is difficult to optimize as the prediction slot of each object query does not have a specific mode.  In other words, each object query will not focus on a specific region. To solve these problems, in our query design, object queries are based on anchor points, which are widely used in CNN-based detectors.  So each object query focuses on the objects near the anchor point.  Moreover, our query design can predict multiple objects at one position to solve the difficulty: ``one region, multiple objects''. In addition, we design an attention variant, which can reduce the memory cost while achieving similar or better performance than the standard attention in DETR. Thanks to the query design and the attention variant, the proposed detector that we called Anchor DETR, can achieve better performance and run faster than the DETR with 10x fewer training epochs.

In this paper, we propose a novel GAN Prior based degradation-aware feature interpolation network, dubbed Panini-Net, for FR tasks by explicitly learning the abstract representations to distinguish various degradations. Specifically, an unsupervised degradation representation learning (UDRL) strategy is first developed to extract degradation representations (DR) of the input degraded images.

Existing methods typically apply a detection or regression pipeline on the fused representation with the research focus on designing complicated prediction heads or fusion strategies. Instead, from a perspective on temporal grounding as a metric-learning problem, we present a Mutual Matching Network (MMN), to directly model the similarity between language queries and video moments in a joint embedding space. This new metric-learning framework enables fully exploiting negative samples from two new aspects: constructing negative cross-modal pairs in a mutual matching scheme and mining negative pairs across different videos. These new negative samples could enhance the joint representation learning of two modalities via cross-modal mutual matching to maximize their mutual information. Experiments show that our MMN achieves highly competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods on four video grounding benchmarks.

Using tools from parameterized complexity we design fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for two large fragments of the STP. Our main algorithmic results employ reductions to the Directed Subset Feedback Arc Set problem and  iterative compression combined with an efficient algorithm for the Edge Multicut problem.

Existing algorithms for finding backdoors rely on sampling candidate variable subsets in various ways, an approach which has demonstrated the existence of backdoors for some instances from MIPLIB2003 and MIPLIB2010.

In this paper, we show that SAA remains tractable when the distribution of unknown parameters is only observable through dependent instances and still enjoys asymptotic consistency and finite sample guarantees. Specifically, we provide a rigorous probability error analysis to derive 1 - beta confidence bounds for the out-of-sample performance of SAA estimators and show that these estimators are asymptotically consistent. We then, using monotone operator theory, study the performance of a class of stochastic first-order algorithms trained on a dependent source of data. We show that approximation error for these algorithms is bounded and concentrates around zero, and establish deviation bounds for iterates when the underlying stochastic process is phi-mixing. The algorithms presented can be used to handle numerically inconvenient loss functions such as the sum of a smooth and non-smooth function or of non-smooth functions with constraints. To illustrate the usefulness of our results, we present several stochastic versions of popular algorithms such as stochastic proximal gradient descent (S-PGD), stochastic relaxed Peaceman-Rachford splitting algorithms (S-rPRS), and numerical experiment."}

Although existing approaches can successfully generate adversarial examples in the hard-label setting, they follow an ideal assumption that the victim model does not restrict the number of queries. However, in real-world applications the query budget is usually tight or limited. Moreover, existing hard-label adversarial attack techniques use the genetic algorithm to optimize discrete text data by maintaining a number of adversarial candidates during optimization, which can lead to the problem of generating low-quality adversarial examples in the tight-budget setting. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a new method named TextHoaxer by formulating the budgeted hard-label adversarial attack task on text data as a gradient-based optimization problem of perturbation matrix in the continuous word embedding space. Compared with the genetic algorithm-based optimization, our solution only uses a single initialized adversarial example as the adversarial candidate for optimization, which significantly reduces the number of queries. The optimization is guided by a new objective function consisting of three terms, i.e., semantic similarity term, pair-wise perturbation constraint, and sparsity constraint. Semantic similarity term and pair-wise perturbation constraint can ensure the high semantic similarity of adversarial examples from both comprehensive text-level and individual word-level, while the sparsity constraint explicitly restricts the number of perturbed words, which is also helpful for enhancing the quality of generated text. We conduct extensive experiments on eight text datasets against three representative natural language models, and experimental results show that TextHoaxer can generate high-quality adversarial examples with higher semantic similarity and lower perturbation rate under the tight-budget setting."}

On the one hand, the precise modelling of these constraints, which are formulated in various relation algebras, entails a number of possible logical combinations and requires expertise in constraint-based modelling.  On the other hand, active constraint acquisition (CA) has been used successfully to support non-experienced users in learning conjunctive constraint networks through the generation of a sequence of queries.   In this paper, we propose GEACQ, which stands for Generic Qualitative Constraint Acquisition, an active CA method that learns qualitative constraints   via the concept of qualitative queries.  GEACQ combines qualitative queries with time-bounded path consistency (PC) and background knowledge propagation to acquire the qualitative constraints of any scheduling or packing problem.  We prove soundness, completeness and termination of GEACQ by exploiting the jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint property of qualitative calculus and we give an experimental evaluation that shows (i) the efficiency of our approach in learning temporal constraints and, (ii) the use of GEACQ on real scheduling instances."}

Statistical methods based on extreme value theory provide a systematic way for modeling the distribution of extreme values. In particular, the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) is useful for modeling the distribution of excess values above a certain threshold. However, applying such methods to large-scale geospatio-temporal data is a challenge due to the difficulty in capturing the complex spatial relationships between extreme events at multiple locations. This paper presents a deep learning framework for long-term prediction of the distribution of extreme values at different locations. We highlight its computational challenges and present a novel framework that combines convolutional neural networks with deep set and GPD. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world dataset for modeling extreme climate events."}

However, according to our experimental observation, it spends most of the total communication cost on the index of the selected parameters (i.e., their position informa-tion), which is inefficient for FL training. To solve this problem, we propose a FL compression algorithm for convolution neural networks (CNNs), called SmartIdx, by extending the traditional Top-k largest variation selection strategy intothe convolution-kernel-based selection, to reduce the proportion of the index in the overall communication cost and thusachieve a high compression ratio. The basic idea of SmartIdx is to improve the 1:1 proportion relationship betweenthe value and index of the parameters to n:1, by regarding the convolution kernel as the basic selecting unit in parameter selection, which can potentially deliver more informationto the parameter server under the limited network traffic. Tothis end, a set of rules are designed for judging which kernel should be selected and the corresponding packaging strategies are also proposed for further improving the compressionratio. Experiments on mainstream CNNs and datasets show that our proposed SmartIdx performs 2.5×−69.2× higher compression ratio than the state-of-the-art FL compression algorithms without degrading model performance."}

Thereinto, hashing has become a prevalent choice due to its retrieval efficiency and low storage cost. Although multi-modal hashing has drawn lots of attention in recent years, there still remain some problems. The first point is that existing methods are mainly designed in batch mode and not able to efficiently handle streaming multi-modal data. The second point is that all existing online multi-modal hashing methods fail to effectively handle unseen new classes which come continuously with streaming data chunks. In this paper, we propose a new model, termed Online enhAnced SemantIc haShing (OASIS). We design novel semantic-enhanced representation for data, which could help handle the new coming classes, and thereby construct the enhanced semantic objective function. An efficient and effective discrete online optimization algorithm is further proposed for OASIS. Extensive experiments show that our method can exceed the state-of-the-art models. For good reproducibility and benefiting the community, our code and data are already publicly available."}

However, typical GNN models heavily rely on labeled data in the learning process, while ignoring or paying little attention to the data that are unlabeled but available. To make full use of available data, we propose a generic framework, Contrastive Context Sharing (CoCoS), to enhance the learning capacity of GNNs for semi-supervised tasks. By sharing the contextual information among nodes estimated to be in the same class, different nodes can be correlated even if they are unlabeled and remote from each other in the graph. Models can therefore learn different combinations of contextual patterns, which improves the robustness of node representations. Additionally, motivated by recent advances in self-supervised learning, we augment the context sharing strategy by integrating with contrastive learning, which naturally correlates intra-class and inter-class data. Such operations utilize all available data for training and effectively improve a model's learning capacity. CoCoS can be easily extended to a wide range of GNN-based models with little computational overheads. Extensive experiments show that CoCoS considerably enhances typical GNN models, especially when labeled data are sparse in a graph, and achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results in real-world public datasets. The code of CoCoS is available online."}

Existing works assume the attacker is either (partly) aware of the victim model, or able to send queries to it. These assumptions are, however, unrealistic. To bridge the gap between theoretical graph attacks and real-world scenarios, in this work, we propose a novel and more realistic setting: strict black-box graph attack, in which the attacker has no knowledge about the victim model at all and is not allowed to send any queries. To design such an attack strategy, we first propose a generic graph filter to unify different families of graph-based models. The strength of attacks can then be quantified by the change in the graph filter before and after attack. By maximizing this change, we are able to find an effective attack strategy, regardless of the underlying model. To solve this optimization problem, we also propose a relaxation technique and approximation theories to reduce the difficulty as well as the computational expense. Experiments demonstrate that, even with no exposure to the model, the Macro-F1 drops 6.4% in node classification and 29.5% in graph classification, which is a significant result compared with existent works."}

Existing approaches typically decompose n-ary relational facts into subtuples (entity pairs, triples or quintuples, etc.), and they generally model n-ary relational KBs in Euclidean space. However, n-ary relational facts are semantically and structurally intact, decomposition leads to the loss of global information and undermines the semantical and structural integrity. Moreover, compared to the binary relational KBs, n-ary ones are characterized by more abundant and complicated hierarchy structures, which could not be well expressed in Euclidean space. To address the issues, we propose a gyro-polygon embedding approach to realize n-ary fact integrity keeping and hierarchy capturing, termed as PolygonE. Specifically, n-ary relational facts are modeled as gyro-polygons in the hyperbolic space, where we denote entities in facts as vertexes of gyro-polygons and relations as entity translocation operations. Importantly, we design a fact plausibility measuring strategy based on the vertex-gyrocentroid geodesic to optimize the relation-adjusted gyro-polygon. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PolygonE shows SOTA performance on all benchmark datasets, generalizability to binary data, and applicability to arbitrary arity fact. Finally, we also visualize the embedding to help comprehend PolygonE's awareness of hierarchies."}

It is regarded as a “silver bullet” to simultaneously perform explicit alignment between queries and documents and also broaden the representations of queries. And we propose a model named CLIR with HIerarchical Knowledge Enhancement (HIKE) for our task. The proposed model encodes the textual information in queries, documents and the KG with multilingual BERT, and incorporates the KG information in the query-document matching process with a hierarchical information fusion mechanism. Particularly, HIKE first integrates the entities and their neighborhood in KG into query representations with a knowledge-level fusion, then combines the knowledge from both source and target languages to further mitigate the linguistic gap with a language-level fusion. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that HIKE achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art competitors."}

It matters a lot to the player retention and game ecology how the guilds are going, e.g., healthy or not. The main challenge now is to characterize and predict the guild health in a quantitative, dynamic, and multi-dimensional manner based on complicated multi-media data streams. To this end, we propose a novel framework, namely Stability-Aware Multi-task Learning Approach(SAMLA) to address these challenges. Specifically, different media-specific modules are designed to extract information from multiple media types of tabular data, time seriescharacteristics, and heterogeneous graphs. To capture the dynamics of guild health, we introduce a representation encoder to provide a time series view of multi-media data that is used for task prediction. Inspiredby well-received theories on organization management, we delicately define five specific and quantitative dimensions of guild health and make parallel predictions based on a multi-task approach. Besides, we devise a novel auxiliary task, i.e.,the guild stability, to boost the performance of the guild health prediction task. Extensive experiments on a real-world large-scale MMORPG dataset verify that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the task of organizational health characterization and prediction. Moreover, our work has been practically deployed in online MMORPG, and case studies clearly illustrate the significant value."}

The problem corresponds to the simplest generalization of the edge based densest-K-subgraph problem (DKS) to the case of higher-order network motifs. We prove that TDKS is NP-hard and is not amenable to efficient approximation, in the worst-case. By judiciously exploiting the structure of the problem, we propose a relaxation algorithm for the purpose of obtaining high-quality, sub-optimal solutions. Our approach utilizes the fact that the cost function of TDKS is submodular to construct a convex relaxation for the problem based on the Lovász extension for submodular functions. We demonstrate that our approaches attain state-of-the-art performance on real-world graphs and can offer substantially improved exploration of the optimal density-size curve compared to sophisticated approximation baselines for DKS. We use document summarization to showcase why TDKS is a useful generalization of DKS."}

Due to the non-stationary nature of the environment, the streaming data distribution may change in unpredictable ways, which is known as the concept drift in the literature. To handle concept drift, previous methods first detect when/where the concept drift happens and then adapt models to fit the distribution of the latest data. However, there are still many cases that some underlying factors of environment evolution are predictable, making it possible to model the future concept drift trend of the streaming data, while such cases are not fully explored in previous work. In this paper, we propose a novel method DDG-DA, that can effectively forecast the evolution of data distribution and improve the performance of models. Specifically, we first train a predictor to estimate the future data distribution, then leverage it to generate training samples, and finally train models on the generated data. We conduct experiments on three real-world tasks (forecasting on stock price trend, electricity load and solar irradiance) and obtained significant improvement on multiple widely-used models."}

However, matching heterogeneous graphs with partial overlap remains a challenging problem in real-world applications. This paper proposes the first practical learning-to-match method to meet this challenge. The proposed unsupervised method adopts a novel partial optimal transport paradigm to learn a transport plan and node embeddings simultaneously. In a from-one-to-all manner, the entire learning procedure is decomposed into a series of easy-to-solve sub-procedures, each of which only handles the alignment of a single type of nodes. A mechanism for searching the transport mass is also proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art graph matching methods."}

However, information and knowledge evolve continuously, and temporal dynamics emerge, which are expected to influence future situations. In temporal knowledge graphs, time information is integrated into the graph by equipping each edge with a timestamp or a time range. Embedding-based methods have been introduced for link prediction on temporal knowledge graphs, but they mostly lack explainability and comprehensible reasoning chains. Particularly, they are usually not designed to deal with link forecasting -- event prediction involving future timestamps. We address the task of link forecasting on temporal knowledge graphs and introduce TLogic, an explainable framework that is based on temporal logical rules extracted via temporal random walks. We compare TLogic with state-of-the-art baselines on three benchmark datasets and show better overall performance while our method also provides explanations that preserve time consistency. Furthermore, in contrast to most state-of-the-art embedding-based methods, TLogic works well in the inductive setting where already learned rules are transferred to related datasets with a common vocabulary."}

Previous methods usually focus on the order or structure of the infected users in a single cascade, thus ignoring the global dependencies of users and cascades, limiting the performance of prediction. Current strategies to introduce social networks only learn the social homogeneity among users, which is not enough to describe their interaction preferences, let alone the dynamic changes. To address the above issues, we propose a novel information diffusion prediction model named Memory-enhanced Sequential Hypergraph Attention Networks (MS-HGAT). Specifically, to introduce the global dependencies of users, we not only take advantages of their friendships, but also consider their interactions at the cascade level. Furthermore, to dynamically capture user' preferences, we divide the diffusion hypergraph into several sub graphs based on timestamps, develop Hypergraph Attention Networks to learn the sequential hypergraphs, and connect them with gated fusion strategy. In addition, a memory-enhanced embedding lookup module is proposed to capture the learned user representations into the cascade-specific embedding space, thus highlighting the feature interaction within the cascade. The experimental results over four realistic datasets demonstrate that MS-HGAT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art diffusion prediction models in both Hits@K and MAP@k metrics."}

Since nearby regions usually have similar socioeconomic characteristics which indicate similar crime patterns, recent state-of-the-art solutions constructed a distance-based region graph and utilized Graph Neural Network (GNN) techniques for crime forecasting, because the GNN techniques could effectively exploit the latent relationships between neighboring region nodes in the graph if the edges reveal high dependency or correlation. However, this distance-based pre-defined graph can not fully capture crime correlation between regions that are far from each other but share similar crime patterns. Hence, to make a more accurate crime prediction, the main challenge is to learn a better graph that reveals the dependencies between regions in crime occurrences and meanwhile captures the temporal patterns from historical crime records. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end graph convolutional recurrent network called HAGEN with several novel designs for crime prediction. Specifically, our framework could jointly capture the crime correlation between regions and the temporal crime dynamics by combining an adaptive region graph learning module with the Diffusion Convolution Gated Recurrent Unit (DCGRU). Based on the homophily assumption of GNN (i.e., graph convolution works better where neighboring nodes share the same label), we propose a homophily-aware constraint to regularize the optimization of the region graph so that neighboring region nodes on the learned graph share similar crime patterns, thus fitting the mechanism of diffusion convolution. Empirical experiments and comprehensive analysis on two real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of HAGEN."}

In this paper, we focus on objectively judging what and where to return strokes, which is still unexplored in turn-based sports. By formulating stroke forecasting as a sequence prediction task, existing works can tackle the problem but fail to model information based on the characteristics of badminton. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Position-aware Fusion of Rally Progress and Player Styles framework (ShuttleNet) that incorporates rally progress and information of the players by two modified encoder-decoder extractors. Moreover, we design a fusion network to integrate rally contexts and contexts of the players by conditioning on information dependency and different positions. Extensive experiments on the badminton dataset demonstrate that ShuttleNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and also empirically validates the feasibility of each component in ShuttleNet. On top of that, we provide an analysis scenario for the stroke forecasting problem."}

We consider real-time systems, which can be modeled with Timed Automata: our approach is thus a Timed Automata learner. There is a handful of related work, however, they might require a lot of parameters or produce Timed Automata that either are undeterministic or lack precision. In contrast, our proposed approach, called TAG, requires only one parameter and learns a deterministic Timed Automaton having a good tradeoff between accuracy and complexity of the automata. This allows getting an interpretable and accurate global model of the real-time system considered. Our experiments compare our approach to the related work and demonstrate its merits."}

Estimating the cost of candidate reactions has been proved effectively to prune the search space, which could achieve a higher accuracy with the same search iteration. And the estimation of one reaction is comprised of the estimations of all its reactants. So, how to estimate the cost of these reactants will directly influence the quality of results.

The implicit feature interaction and high-dimensional data make multivariate forecasting very challenging. Many existing works did not put more emphasis on exploring explicit correlation among multiple time series data, and complicated models are designed to capture long- and short-range pattern with the aid of attention mechanism. In this work, we think that pre-defined graph or general learning method is difficult due to their irregular structure. Hence, we present CATN, an end-to-end model of Cross Attentive Tree-aware Network to jointly capture the inter-series correlation and intra-series temporal pattern. We first construct a tree structure to learn hierarchical and grouped correlation and design an embedding approach that can pass dynamic message to generalize implicit but interpretable cross features among multiple time series. Next in temporal aspect, we propose a multi-level dependency learning mechanism including global&local learning and cross attention mechanism, which can combine long-range dependencies, short-range dependencies as well as cross dependencies at different time steps.

Numerous recommendation algorithms based on collaborative filtering have leveraged post-click user behavior (e.g., skip) to identify false positives. They effectively involved these false positives in the model supervision as negative-like signals. Yet, false positives had not been considered in existing session-based recommendation systems (SBRs) although they provide just as deleterious effects.   To resolve false positives in SBRs, we first introduce FP-Metric model which reformulates the objective of the session-based recommendation with FP constraints into metric learning regularization. In addition, we propose FP-AdaMetric that enhances the metric-learning regularization terms with an adaptive module that elaborately calculates the impact of FPs inside sequential patterns. We verify that FP-AdaMetric improves several session-based recommendation models' performances in terms of Hit Rate (HR), MRR, and NDCG on datasets from different domains including music, movie, and game. Furthermore, we show that the adaptive module plays a much more crucial role in FP-AdaMetric model than in other baselines."}

The lack of integration between physical principles and data-driven models is an important reason for limiting the development of this field. In the literature, physics-based methods can usually provide a clear interpretation of the dynamic process of traffic flow systems but are with limited accuracy, while data-driven methods, especially deep learning with black-box structures, can achieve improved performance but can not be fully trusted due to lack of a reasonable physical basis. To bridge the gap between purely data-driven and physics-driven approaches, we propose a physics-guided deep learning model named Spatio-Temporal Differential Equation Network (STDEN), which casts the physical mechanism of traffic flow dynamics into a deep neural network framework. Specifically, we assume the traffic flow on road networks is driven by a latent potential energy field (like water flows are driven by the gravity field), and model the spatio-temporal dynamic process of the potential energy field as a differential equation network. STDEN absorbs both the performance advantage of data-driven models and the interpretability of physics-based models, so is named a physics-guided prediction model. Experiments on three real-world traffic datasets in Beijing show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. A case study further verifies that STDEN can capture the mechanism of urban traffic and generate accurate predictions with physical meaning. The proposed framework of differential equation network modeling may also cast light on other similar applications."}

Although many commonly-used neural components (e.g., convolution) and extensible neural networks (e.g., ResNet) have been developed by the machine learning community, few of them were effective for tabular data and few designs were adequately tailored for tabular data structures. In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible neural component for tabular data, called Abstract Layer (AbstLay), which learns to explicitly group correlative input features and generate higher-level features for semantics abstraction. Also, we design a structure re-parameterization method to compress the trained AbstLay, thus reducing the computational complexity by a clear margin in the reference phase. A special basic block is built using AbstLays, and we construct a family of Deep Abstract Networks (DANets) for tabular data classification and regression by stacking such blocks. In DANets, a special shortcut path is introduced to fetch information from raw tabular features, assisting feature interactions across different levels. Comprehensive experiments on seven real-world tabular datasets show that our AbstLay and DANets are effective for tabular data classification and regression, and the computational complexity is superior to competitive methods. Besides, we evaluate the performance gains of DANet as it goes deep, verifying the extendibility of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/WhatAShot/DANet."}

Specifically, two Graph Convolutional Networks are adopted to capture the above two types of structure information at different time stages, which are then combined with a temporal fusing unit. This allows for learning the dynamic event representations in a more fine-grained manner, and incrementally aggregating them to capture the cascading effect for better rumor detection. Extensive experiments on two public real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposal yields significant improvements compared to strong baselines and can detect rumors at early stages."}

Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Contact-Distil to improve the low homologous PCMP accuracy through knowledge distillation on a self-supervised model. Particularly, two pre-trained transformers are exploited to learn the high quality and low quality MSA representation in parallel for the teacher and student model correspondingly.

Metagenomics studies the genomic material of such communities through high-throughput sequencing that yields DNA subsequences for subsequent analysis. A fundamental problem in the standard workflow, called binning, is to discover clusters, of genomic subsequences, associated with the constituent organisms. Inherent noise in the subsequences, various biological constraints that need to be imposed on them and the skewed cluster size distribution exacerbate the difficulty of this unsupervised learning problem. In this paper, we present a new formulation using a graph where the nodes are subsequences and edges represent homophily information. In addition, we model biological constraints providing heterophilous signal about nodes that cannot be clustered together. We solve the binning problem by developing new algorithms for (i) graph representation learning that preserves both homophily relations and heterophily constraints (ii) constraint-based graph clustering method that addresses the problems of skewed cluster size distribution. Extensive experiments, on real and synthetic datasets, demonstrate that our approach, called RepBin, outperforms a wide variety of competing methods. Our constraint-based graph representation learning and clustering methods, that may be useful in other domains as well, advance the state-of-the-art in both metagenomics binning and graph representation learning."}

While recent advances in deep learning (DL) provide a powerful approach to dealing with large-scale NSGs, DL methods such as NSG-NFSP suffer from the problem of data inefficiency.

In this paper, we propose a novel DL-based method, NSGZero, to learn a non-exploitable policy in NSGs. NSGZero improves data efficiency by performing planning with neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our main contributions are threefold. First, we design deep neural networks (DNNs) to perform neural MCTS in NSGs. Second, we enable neural MCTS with decentralized control, making NSGZero applicable to NSGs with many resources. Third, we provide an efficient learning paradigm, to achieve joint training of the DNNs in NSGZero. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, our method achieves significantly better data efficiency and scalability."}

Such a design methodology, namely robust design, has been widely implemented in the industry for product quality control. However, classic robust design requires a lot of evaluations for a single design target, while the results of these evaluations could not be reused for a new target. To achieve data-efficient robust design, we propose Robust Inverse Design under Noise (RID-Noise), which can utilize existing data to train a conditional invertible neural network. Specifically, we estimate the robustness of a design parameter by its predictability, measured by the prediction error of a forward neural network. We also define a sample-wise weight, which can be used in the maximum weighted likelihood estimation of an inverse model based on a conditional invertible neural network. With the visual results from experiments, we clearly justify how RID-Noise works by learning the distribution and robustness from data. Further experiments on several real-world benchmark tasks with noises confirm that our method is more effective than other state-of-the-art inverse design methods.

Existing algorithms rely on some manually designed and pre-fixed informativeness/uncertainty metrics of question for selections, which is labor-intensive and not sufficient for capturing complex relations between students and questions. In this paper, we propose a fully adaptive framework named Neural Computerized Adaptive Testing (NCAT), which formally redefines CAT as a reinforcement learning problem and directly learns selection algorithm from real-world data. Specifically, a bilevel optimization is defined and simplified under CAT's application scenarios to make the algorithm learnable. Furthermore, to address the CAT task effectively, we tackle it as an equivalent reinforcement learning problem and propose an attentive neural policy to model complex non-linear interactions.

One of the most common approach to student assessment is Knowledge Tracing (KT), which evaluates a student's knowledge state by predicting whether the student will answer a given question correctly or not. However, in the context of multiple choice (polytomous) questions, conventional KT approaches are limited in that they only consider the binary (dichotomous) correctness label (i.e., correct or incorrect), and disregard the specific option chosen by the student.   Meanwhile, Option Tracing (OT) attempts to model a student by predicting which option they will choose for a given question, but overlooks the correctness information. In this paper, we propose Dichotomous-Polytomous Multi-Task Learning (DP-MTL), a multi-task learning framework that combines KT and OT for more precise student assessment. In particular, we show that the KT objective acts as a regularization term for OT in the DP-MTL framework, and propose an appropriate architecture for applying our method on top of existing deep learning-based KT models. We experimentally confirm that DP-MTL significantly improves both KT and OT performances, and also benefits downstream tasks such as Score Prediction (SP)."}

Inspired by this, we reformulate automatic diagnosis as a symptoms Sequence Generation (SG) task and propose a simple but effective automatic Diagnosis model based on Transformer (Diaformer). We firstly design the symptom attention framework to learn the generation of symptom inquiry and the disease diagnosis. To alleviate the discrepancy between sequential generation and disorder of implicit symptoms, we further design three orderless training mechanisms.

Towards building more effective factor models, recent years have witnessed the paradigm shift from linear models to more flexible nonlinear data-driven machine learning models. However, due to low signal-to-noise ratio of the financial data, it is quite challenging to learn effective factor models. In this paper, we propose a novel factor model, FactorVAE, as a probabilistic model with inherent randomness for noise modeling. Essentially, our model integrates the dynamic factor model (DFM) with the variational autoencoder (VAE) in machine learning, and we propose a prior-posterior learning method based on VAE, which can effectively guide the learning of model by approximating an optimal posterior factor model with future information. Particularly, considering that risk modeling is important for the noisy stock data, FactorVAE can estimate the variances from the distribution over the latent space of VAE, in addition to predicting returns. The experiments on the real stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of FactorVAE, which outperforms various baseline methods."}

The key challenge is to align cross-modality representations conforming to semantic information present for a person and ignore background information. This work presents a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture designed to learn semantically aligned cross-modal visual and textual representations. The underlying building block, named AXM-Block, is a unified multi-layer network that dynamically exploits the multi-scale knowledge from both modalities and re-calibrates each modality according to shared semantics. To complement the convolutional design, contextual attention is applied in the text branch to manipulate long-term dependencies. Moreover, we propose a unique design to enhance visual part-based feature coherence and locality information. Our framework is novel in its ability to implicitly learn aligned semantics between modalities during the feature learning stage. The unified feature learning effectively utilizes textual data as a super-annotation signal for visual representation learning and automatically rejects irrelevant information. The entire AXM-Net is trained end-to-end on CUHK-PEDES data. We report results on two tasks, person search and cross-modal Re-ID. The AXM-Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and achieves 64.44% Rank@1 on the CUHK-PEDES test set.

Previous works for processing point clouds lie in either projection or voxelization. However, projection-based methods suffer from information loss while voxelization-based methods bring huge computation. In this paper, we propose to encode point clouds into structured color image representation (SCIR) and utilize 2D CNN to fulfill the 3D detection task. Specifically, we use the structured color image encoding module to convert the irregular 3D point clouds into a squared 2D tensor image, where each point corresponds to a spatial point in the 3D space. Furthermore, in order to fit for the Euclidean structure, we apply feature normalization to parameterize the 2D tensor image onto a regular dense color image. Then, we conduct repeated multi-scale fusion with different levels so as to augment the initial features and learn scale-aware feature representations for box prediction. Extensive experiments on KITTI benchmark, Waymo Open Dataset and more challenging nuScenes dataset show that our proposed method yields decent results and demonstrate the effectiveness of such representations for point clouds."}

Skillful SSF would have substantial societal value in areas such as agricultural productivity, hydrology and water resource management, and emergency planning for extreme events such as droughts and wildfires. Despite its societal importance, SSF has stayed a challenging problem compared to both short-term weather forecasting and long-term seasonal forecasting. Recent studies have shown the potential of machine learning (ML) models to advance SSF. In this paper, for the first time, we perform a fine-grained comparison of a suite of modern ML models with start-of-the-art physics-based dynamical models from the Subseasonal Experiment (SubX) project for SSF in the western contiguous United States. Additionally, we explore mechanisms to enhance the ML models by using forecasts from dynamical models. Empirical results illustrate that, on average, ML models outperform dynamical models while the ML models tend to generate forecasts with conservative magnitude compared to the SubX models. Further, we illustrate that ML models make forecasting errors under extreme weather conditions, e.g., cold waves due to the polar vortex, highlighting the need for separate models for extreme events. Finally, we show that suitably incorporating dynamical model forecasts as inputs to ML models can substantially improve the forecasting performance of the ML models. The SSF dataset constructed for the work and code for the ML models are released along with the paper for the benefit of the artificial intelligence community."}

Generative models of these data are of particular interest, as they enable a range of impactful downstream applications like simulation or creating synthetic training data. Recently, COT-GAN, a new GAN algorithm inspired by the theory of causal optimal transport (COT), was proposed in an attempt to improve generation of sequential data.  However, the task of learning complex patterns over time and space requires additional knowledge of the specific data structures. In this study, we propose a novel loss objective combined with COT-GAN based on an autoregressive embedding to reinforce the learning of spatio-temporal dynamics. We devise SPATE (spatio-temporal association), a new metric measuring spatio-temporal autocorrelation. We compute SPATE for real and synthetic data samples and use it to compute an embedding loss that considers space-time interactions, nudging the GAN to learn outputs that are faithful to the observed dynamics. We test our new SPATE-GAN on a diverse set of spatio-temporal patterns: turbulent flows, log-Gaussian Cox processes and global weather data. We show that our novel embedding loss improves performance without any changes to the architecture of the GAN backbone, highlighting our model's increased capacity for capturing autoregressive structures."}

One of major obstacles to hinder the successful prediction of molecular property by GNNs is the scarcity of labeled data. Though graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods have achieved extraordinary performance with insufficient labeled data, most focused on designing data augmentation schemes for general graphs. However, the fundamental property of a molecule could be altered with the augmentation method (like random perturbation) on molecular graphs. Whereas, the critical geometric information of molecules remains rarely explored under the current GNN and GCL architectures. To this end, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method utilizing the geometry of the molecule across 2D and 3D views, which is named GeomGCL. Specifically, we first devise a dual-view geometric message passing network (GeomMPNN) to adaptively leverage the rich information of both 2D and 3D graphs of a molecule. The incorporation of geometric properties at different levels can greatly facilitate the molecular representation learning. Then a novel geometric graph contrastive scheme is designed to make both geometric views collaboratively supervise each other to improve the generalization ability of GeomMPNN. We evaluate GeomGCL on various downstream property prediction tasks via a finetune process. Experimental results on seven real-life molecular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed GeomGCL against state-of-the-art baselines."}

Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potentials in devising optimal signal plans that can adapt to dynamic traffic congestion. However, several challenges still need to be overcome. Firstly, a paradigm of state, action, and reward design is needed, especially for an optimality-guaranteed reward function. Secondly, the generalization of the RL algorithms is hindered by the varied topologies and physical properties of intersections. Lastly, enhancing the cooperation between intersections is needed for large network applications. To address these issues, the Option-Action RL framework for universal Multi-intersection control (OAM) is proposed. Based on the well-known cell transmission model, we first define a lane-cell-level state to better model the traffic flow propagation. Based on this physical queuing dynamics, we propose a regularized delay as the reward to facilitate temporal credit assignment while maintaining the equivalence with minimizing the average travel time. We then recapitulate the phase actions as the constrained combinations of lane options and design a universal neural network structure to realize model generalization to any intersection with any phase definition. The multiple-intersection cooperation is then rigorously discussed using the potential game theory.    We test the OAM algorithm under four networks with different settings, including a city-level scenario with 2,048 intersections using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the OAM can outperform the state-of-the-art controllers in reducing the average travel time."}

The less time EMVs spend traveling through the traffic, the more likely it would help save people's lives and reduce property loss. To reduce the travel time of EMVs, prior work has used route optimization based on historical traffic-flow data and traffic signal pre-emption based on the optimal route. However, traffic signal pre-emption dynamically changes the traffic flow which, in turn, modifies the optimal route of an EMV. In addition, traffic signal pre-emption practices usually lead to significant disturbances in traffic flow and subsequently increase the travel time for non-EMVs. In this paper, we propose EMVLight, a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework for simultaneous dynamic routing and traffic signal control. EMVLight extends Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently update the optimal route for the EMVs in real-time as it travels through the traffic network. The decentralized RL agents learn network-level cooperative traffic signal phase strategies that not only reduce EMV travel time but also reduce the average travel time of non-EMVs in the network. This benefit has been demonstrated through comprehensive experiments with synthetic and real-world maps. These experiments show that EMVLight outperforms benchmark transportation engineering techniques and existing RL-based signal control methods."}

Standard approaches for computing equilibria in these games reformulate the followers' best response as constraints in the leader's optimization problem. These reformulation approaches can sometimes be effective, but make limiting assumptions on the followers' objectives and the equilibrium reached by followers, e.g., uniqueness, optimism, or pessimism. To overcome these limitations, we run gradient descent to update the leader's strategy by differentiating through the equilibrium reached by followers. Our approach generalizes to any stochastic equilibrium selection procedure that chooses from multiple equilibria, where we compute the stochastic gradient by back-propagating through a sampled Nash equilibrium using the solution to a partial differential equation to establish the unbiasedness of the stochastic gradient. Using the unbiased gradient estimate, we implement the gradient-based approach to solve three Stackelberg problems with multiple followers. Our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines to achieve higher utility for the leader."}

First, if d represents the doubling dimension of the metric space, we show that the distortion of STV is O(d log log m), where m represents the number of candidates. For doubling metrics this implies an exponential improvement over the lower bound for general metrics, and as a special case it effectively answers a question left open by Skowron and Elkind (AAAI '17) regarding the distortion of STV under low-dimensional Euclidean spaces. More broadly, this constitutes the first nexus between the performance of any voting rule and the ``intrinsic dimensionality'' of the underlying metric space. We also establish a nearly-matching lower bound, refining the construction of Skowron and Elkind. Moreover, motivated by the efficiency of STV, we investigate whether natural learning rules can lead to low-distortion outcomes.

They are challenged both to simulate the model on fresh reviews, and to edit reviews with the goal of lowering the probability of the originally predicted class. Successful manipulations would lead to an adversarial example. During the training (but not the test) phase, input spans are highlighted to communicate salience. Through our evaluation, we observe that for a linear bag-of-words model, participants with access to the feature coefficients during training are able to cause a larger reduction in model confidence in the testing phase when compared to the no-explanation control. For the BERT-based classifier, popular local explanations do not improve their ability to reduce the model confidence over the no-explanation case. Remarkably, when the explanation for the BERT model is given by the (global) attributions of a linear model trained to imitate the BERT model, people can effectively manipulate the model."}

Counterfactual explanations can help users understand not only why ML models make certain decisions, but also how these decisions can be changed.   We frame the problem of finding counterfactual explanations as an optimization task and extend previous work that could only be applied to differentiable models.   In order to accommodate non-differentiable models such as tree ensembles, we use probabilistic model approximations in the optimization framework.  We introduce an approximation technique that is effective for finding counterfactual explanations for predictions of the original model and show that our counterfactual examples are significantly closer to the original instances than those produced by other methods specifically designed for tree ensembles."}

In this work, we propose a time-travelling visual solution DeepVisualInsight (DVI), aiming to manifest the spatio-temporal causality while training a deep learning image classifier. The spatio-temporal causality demonstrates how the gradient-descent algorithm and various training data sampling techniques can influence and reshape the layout of learnt input representation and the classification boundaries in consecutive epochs. Such causality allows us to observe and analyze the whole learning process in the visible low dimensional space. Technically, we propose four spatial and temporal properties and design our visualization solution to satisfy them. These properties preserve the most important information when projecting and inverse-projecting input samples between the visible low-dimensional and the invisible high-dimensional space, for causal analyses. Our extensive experiments show that, comparing to baseline approaches, we achieve the best visualization performance regarding the spatial/temporal properties and visualization efficiency. Moreover, our case study shows that our visual solution can well reflect the characteristics of various training scenarios, showing good potential of DVI as a debugging tool for analyzing deep learning training processes."}

However, current research on facial expression recognition (FER) mainly focuses on basic expressions, and thus fails to address the diversity of human emotions in practical scenarios. Meanwhile, existing work on compound FER relies heavily on abundant labeled compound expression training data, which are often laboriously collected under the professional instruction of psychology. In this paper, we study compound FER in the cross-domain few-shot learning setting, where only a few images of novel classes from the target domain are required as a reference. In particular, we aim to identify unseen compound expressions with the model trained on easily accessible basic expression datasets. To alleviate the problem of limited base classes in our FER task, we propose a novel Emotion Guided Similarity Network (EGS-Net), consisting of an emotion branch and a similarity branch, based on a two-stage learning framework. Specifically, in the first stage, the similarity branch is jointly trained with the emotion branch in a multi-task fashion. With the regularization of the emotion branch, we prevent the similarity branch from overfitting to sampled base classes that are highly overlapped across different episodes. In the second stage, the emotion branch and the similarity branch play a “two-student game” to alternately learn from each other, thereby further improving the inference ability of the similarity branch on unseen compound expressions. Experimental results on both in-the-lab and in-the-wild compound expression datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method against several state-of-the-art methods."}

Effective human-agent collaboration requires users to understand the agent's behavior, as failing to do so may cause reduced productivity, misuse or frustration. Agent strategy summarization methods are used to describe the strategy of an agent to users through demonstrations. A summary's objective is to maximize the user's understanding of the agent's aptitude by showcasing its behaviour in a selected set of world states. While shown to be useful, we show that current methods are limited when tasked with comparing between agents, as each summary is independently generated for a specific agent. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating dependent and contrastive summaries that emphasize the differences between agent policies by identifying states in which the agents disagree on the best course of action. We conducted user studies to assess the usefulness of disagreement-based summaries for identifying superior agents and conveying agent differences. Results show disagreement-based summaries lead to improved user performance compared to summaries generated using HIGHLIGHTS, a strategy summarization algorithm which generates summaries for each agent independently."}

In this paper, we propose a novel robust Contextual Transformer-based network for Inertial Navigation (CTIN) to accurately predict velocity and trajectory. To this end, we first design a ResNet-based encoder enhanced by local and global multi-head self-attention to capture spatial contextual information from IMU measurements. Then we fuse these spatial representations with temporal knowledge by leveraging multi-head attention in the Transformer decoder. Finally, multi-task learning with uncertainty reduction is leveraged to improve learning efficiency and prediction accuracy of velocity and trajectory. Through extensive experiments over a wide range of inertial datasets (e.g., RIDI, OxIOD, RoNIN, IDOL, and our own), CTIN is very robust and outperforms state-of-the-art models."}

First-Order Logic theories that admit polynomial-time WFOMC w.r.t domain cardinality are called domain liftable. We introduce the concept of lifted interpretations as a tool for formulating closed forms for WFOMC. Using lifted interpretations, we reconstruct the closed-form formula for polynomial-time FOMC in the universally quantified fragment of FO2, earlier proposed by Beame et al. We then expand this closed-form to incorporate cardinality constraints, existential quantifiers, and counting quantifiers (a.k.a C2) without losing domain-liftability. Finally, we show that the obtained closed-form motivates a natural definition of a family of weight functions strictly larger than symmetric weight functions."}

A KG is a curated set of facts consisting of entities linked by relations. Certain facts include also temporal information forming a Temporal KG (TKG). Although many natural questions involve explicit or implicit time constraints, question answering (QA) over TKGs has been a relatively unexplored area. Existing solutions are mainly designed for simple temporal questions that can be answered directly by a single TKG fact.  This paper puts forth a comprehensive embedding-based framework for answering complex questions over TKGs. Our method termed temporal question reasoning (TempoQR) exploits TKG embeddings to ground the question to the specific entities and time scope it refers to. It does so by augmenting the question embeddings with context, entity and time-aware information by employing three specialized modules. The first computes a textual representation of a given question, the second combines it with the entity embeddings for entities involved in the question, and the third generates question-specific time embeddings. Finally, a transformer-based encoder learns to fuse the generated temporal information with the question representation, which is used for answer predictions. Extensive experiments show that TempoQR improves accuracy by 25--45 percentage points on complex temporal questions over state-of-the-art approaches and it generalizes better to unseen question types."}

Nevertheless, it is common practice in the ﬁeld of model-based diagnosis to make estimations from (biased) best-ﬁrst samples. One example is the computation of a few most probable fault explanations for a defective system and the use of these to assess which aspect of the system, if measured, would bring the highest information gain. In this work, we scrutinize whether these statistically not well-founded conventions, that both diagnosis researchers and practitioners have adhered to for decades, are indeed reasonable. To this end, we empirically analyze various sampling methods that generate fault explanations. We study the representativeness of the produced samples in terms of their estimations about fault explanations and how well they guide diagnostic decisions, and we investigate the impact of sample size, the optimal trade-off between sampling efﬁciency and effectivity, and how approximate sampling techniques compare to exact ones."}

It is a highly expressive knowledge representation language that is well-suited for applications in temporal ontology-based query answering and stream processing. Reasoning in DatalogMTL is, however, of high computational complexity, making implementation challenging and hindering its adoption in applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach for practical reasoning in DatalogMTL which combines materialisation (a.k.a. forward chaining) with automata-based techniques. We have implemented this approach in a reasoner called MeTeoR and evaluated its performance using a temporal extension of the Lehigh University Benchmark and a benchmark based on real-world meteorological data. Our experiments show that MeTeoR is a scalable system which enables reasoning over complex temporal rules and datasets involving tens of millions of temporal facts."}

Recently, multimodal Transformers have made a great progress in the task of Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), by jointly understanding visual objects and text tokens through layers of cross-modality attention. However, these approaches do not utilize the rich structure of the scene and the interactions between objects which are essential in answering complex commonsense questions. We propose a Scene Graph Enhanced  Image-Text  Learning  (SGEITL) framework to incorporate visual scene graph in commonsense reasoning. In order to exploit the scene graph structure, at the model structure level, we propose a multihop graph transformer for regularizing attention interaction among hops. As for pre-training, a scene-graph-aware pre-training method is proposed to leverage structure knowledge extracted in visual scene graph. Moreover, we introduce a method to train and generate domain relevant visual scene graph using textual annotations in a weakly-supervised manner. Extensive experiments on VCR and other tasks show significant performance boost compared with the state-of-the-art methods, and prove the efficacy of each proposed component."}

In this paper, we propose a novel OM system named BERTMap which can support both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. It first predicts mappings using a classifier based on fine-tuning the contextual embedding model BERT on text semantics corpora extracted from ontologies, and then refines the mappings through extension and repair by utilizing the ontology structure and logic. Our evaluation with three alignment tasks on biomedical ontologies demonstrates that BERTMap can often perform better than the leading OM systems LogMap and AML."}

Many approaches encode domain constraints directly into the network architecture, requiring non-trivial or domain-specific engineering. In contrast, our approach, called MultiplexNet, represents domain knowledge as a quantifier-free logical formula in disjunctive normal form (DNF) which is easy to encode and to elicit from human experts. It introduces a latent Categorical variable that learns to choose which constraint term optimizes the error function of the network and it compiles the constraints directly into the output of existing learning algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach empirically on several classical deep learning tasks, such as density estimation and classification in both supervised and unsupervised settings where prior knowledge about the domains was expressed as logical constraints. Our results show that the MultiplexNet approach learned to approximate unknown distributions well, often requiring fewer data samples than the alternative approaches. In some cases, MultiplexNet finds better solutions than the baselines; or solutions that could not be achieved with the alternative approaches. Our contribution is in encoding domain knowledge in a way that facilitates inference. We specifically focus on quantifier-free logical formulae that are specified over the output domain of a network. We show that this approach is both efficient and general; and critically, our approach guarantees 100% constraint satisfaction in a network's output."}

Most KGE models have gained great success, especially on extrapolation scenarios. Specifically, given an unseen triple (h, r, t), a trained model can still correctly predict t from (h, r, ?), or h from (?, r, t), such extrapolation ability is impressive. However, most existing KGE works focus on the design of delicate triple modeling function, which mainly tells us how to measure the plausibility of observed triples, but offers limited explanation of why the methods can extrapolate to unseen data, and what are the important factors to help KGE extrapolate. Therefore in this work, we attempt to study the KGE extrapolation of two problems: 1. How does KGE extrapolate to unseen data? 2. How to design the KGE model with better extrapolation ability?  For the problem 1, we first discuss the impact factors for extrapolation and from relation, entity and triple level respectively, propose three Semantic Evidences (SEs), which can be observed from train set and provide important semantic information for extrapolation. Then we verify the effectiveness of SEs through extensive experiments on several typical KGE methods. For the problem 2, to make better use of the three levels of SE, we propose a novel GNN-based KGE model, called Semantic Evidence aware Graph Neural Network (SE-GNN). In SE-GNN, each level of SE is modeled explicitly by the corresponding neighbor pattern, and merged sufficiently by the multi-layer aggregation, which contributes to obtaining more extrapolative knowledge representation.  Finally, through extensive experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets, we show that SE-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on Knowledge Graph Completion task and performs a better extrapolation ability.

Recent work tries to represent programs with neural networks based on source code structures. However, such methods often focus on the syntax and consider only one single perspective of programs, limiting the representation power of models. This paper proposes a multi-view graph (MVG) program representation method. MVG pays more attention to code semantics and simultaneously includes both data flow and control flow as multiple views. These views are then combined and processed by a graph neural network (GNN) to obtain a comprehensive program representation that covers various aspects. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed MVG approach in the context of algorithm detection, an important and challenging subfield of PLP. Specifically, we use a public dataset POJ-104 and also construct a new challenging dataset ALG-109 to test our method. In experiments, MVG outperforms previous methods significantly, demonstrating our model's strong capability of representing source code."}

For knowledge bases in the basic description logic ALC, the computational complexity of conjunctive query (CQ) answering is well known to be EXPTIME-complete and hence not harder than satisfiability. This does not change when the logic is extended by certain features (such as counting or role hierarchies), whereas adding others (inverses, nominals or transitivity together with role-hierarchies) turns CQ answering exponentially harder.  We contribute to this line of results by showing the surprising fact that even extending ALC by just the Self operator – which proved innocuous in many other contexts – increases the complexity of CQ entailment to 2EXPTIME. As common for this type of problem, our proof establishes a reduction from alternating Turing machines running in exponential space, but several novel ideas and encoding tricks are required to make the approach work in that specific, restricted setting."}

However, the relational matrices in KGC methods often induce a high model complexity, bearing a high risk of overfitting. As a remedy, researchers propose a variety of different regularizers such as the tensor nuclear norm regularizer. Our motivation is based on the observation that the previous work only focuses on the “size” of the parametric space, while leaving the implicit semantic information widely untouched. To address this issue, we propose a new regularizer, namely, Equivariance Regularizer (ER), which can suppress overfitting by leveraging the implicit semantic information. Specifically, ER can enhance the generalization ability of the model by employing the semantic equivariance between the head and tail entities. Moreover, it is a generic solution for both distance based models and tensor factorization based models. Our experimental results indicate a clear and substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art relation prediction methods."}

We also investigate the complexity of credulous and skeptical acceptance in iAF under semi-stable semantics—a problem left open in the literature. We then show that any iAF can be rewritten into an equivalent one where either only (unattacked) arguments or only attacks are uncertain.  Finally, we relate iAF to probabilistic argumentation framework, where uncertainty is quantified."}

However, the unlabeled set often carries unseen classes that cause the deep SSL algorithm to lose generalization. Previous works focus on the data level that they attempt to remove unseen class data or assign lower weight to them but could not eliminate their adverse effects on the SSL algorithm. Rather than focusing on the data level, this paper turns attention to the model parameter level. We find that only partial parameters are essential for seen-class classification, termed safe parameters. In contrast, the other parameters tend to fit irrelevant data, termed harmful parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose Safe Parameter Learning (SPL) to discover safe parameters and make the harmful parameters inactive, such that we can mitigate the adverse effects caused by unseen-class data. Specifically, we firstly design an effective strategy to divide all parameters in the pre-trained SSL model into safe and harmful ones. Then, we introduce a bi-level optimization strategy to update the safe parameters and kill the harmful parameters. Extensive experiments show that SPL outperforms the state-of-the-art SSL methods on all the benchmarks by a large margin. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that SPL can be integrated into the most popular deep SSL networks and be easily extended to handle other cases of class distribution mismatch."}

This framework features a loop training procedure, which enables guiding the improvement of policy by planning with action models and symbolic options learned from interactive trajectories automatically. The learned symbolic options help doing the dense requirement of expert domain knowledge and provide inherent interpretabiliy of policies. Moreover, the transferability and data efficiency can be further improved by planning with the action models. To validate the effectiveness of this framework, we conduct experiments on two domains, Montezuma's Revenge and Office World respectively, and the results demonstrate the comparable performance, improved data efficiency, interpretability and transferability."}

For users with long histories, typical models based on recurrent neural networks tend to forget important items in the distant past. Recent works have shown that storing a small sketch of past items can improve sequential recommendation tasks. However, these works all rely on static sketching policies, i.e., heuristics to select items to keep in the sketch, which are not necessarily optimal and cannot improve over time with more training data. In this paper, we propose a differentiable policy for sketching (DiPS), a framework that learns a data-driven sketching policy in an end-to-end manner together with the recommender system model to explicitly maximize recommendation quality in the future.   We also propose an approximate estimator of the gradient for optimizing the sketching algorithm parameters that is computationally efficient. We verify the effectiveness of DiPS on real-world datasets under various practical settings and show that it requires up to 50% fewer sketch items to reach the same predictive quality than existing sketching policies."}

Understanding modal regression's theoretical behavior can be fundamental in learning theory. Despite significant progress in characterizing its statistical property, the majority results are based on the assumption that samples are independent and identical distributed (i.i.d.), which is too restrictive for real-world applications. This paper concerns about the statistical property of regularized modal regression (RMR) within an important dependence structure - Markov dependent. Specifically, we establish the upper bound for RMR estimator under moderate conditions and give an explicit learning rate. Our results show that the Markov dependence impacts on the generalization error in the way that sample size would be discounted by a multiplicative factor depending on the spectral gap of the underlying Markov chain. This result shed a new light on characterizing the theoretical underpinning for robust regression."}

They are popular for their simple principles and strong performance on unstructured, feature-based data that is commonplace in many practical applications. However, they cannot learn to adapt for a particular set of data due to their lack of trainable parameters. In this paper, we begin by unifying local outlier methods by showing that they are particular cases of the more general message passing framework used in graph neural networks. This allows us to introduce learnability into local outlier methods, in the form of a neural network, for greater flexibility and expressivity: specifically, we propose LUNAR, a novel, graph neural network-based anomaly detection method. LUNAR learns to use information from the nearest neighbours of each node in a trainable way to find anomalies. We show that our method performs significantly better than existing local outlier methods, as well as state-of-the-art deep baselines. We also show that the performance of our method is much more robust to different settings of the local neighbourhood size."}

We call our algorithm GoTube. Through its construction, GoTube ensures that the bounding tube is conservative up to a desired probability and up to a desired tightness.  GoTube is implemented in JAX and optimized to scale to complex continuous-depth neural network models. Compared to advanced reachability analysis tools for time-continuous neural networks, GoTube does not accumulate overapproximation errors between time steps and avoids the infamous wrapping effect inherent in symbolic techniques. We show that GoTube substantially outperforms state-of-the-art verification tools in terms of the size of the initial ball, speed, time-horizon, task completion, and scalability on a large set of experiments.

While impressive progress has been made on static graphs, work on generative modeling of temporal graphs is at a nascent stage with significant scope for improvement. First, existing generative models do not scale with either the time horizon or the number of nodes. Second, existing techniques are transductive in nature and thus do not facilitate knowledge transfer. Finally, due to relying on one-to-one node mapping from source to the generated graph, existing models leak node identity information and do not allow up-scaling/down-scaling the source graph size. In this paper, we bridge these gaps with a novel generative model called TIGGER. TIGGER derives its power through a combination of temporal point processes with auto-regressive modeling enabling both transductive and inductive variants. Through extensive experiments on real datasets, we establish TIGGER generates graphs of superior fidelity, while also being up to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art."}

However, recurrent architectures face the challenge of exploding/vanishing gradients during training, and require significant computational resources to execute back-propagation through time. Moreover, large models are typically needed for executing complex sequential tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel neuron model that has cosine activation with a time varying component for sequential processing. The proposed neuron provides an efficient building block for projecting sequential inputs into spectral domain, which helps to retain long-term dependencies with minimal extra model parameters and computation. A new type of recurrent network architecture, named Oscillatory Fourier Neural Network, based on the proposed neuron is presented and applied to various types of sequential tasks. We demonstrate that recurrent neural network with the proposed neuron model is mathematically equivalent to a simplified form of discrete Fourier transform applied onto periodical activation. In particular, the computationally intensive back-propagation through time in training is eliminated, leading to faster training while achieving the state of the art inference accuracy in a diverse group of sequential tasks. For instance, applying the proposed model to sentiment analysis on IMDB review dataset reaches 89.4% test accuracy within 5 epochs, accompanied by over 35x reduction in the model size compared to LSTM. The proposed novel RNN architecture is well poised for intelligent sequential processing in resource constrained hardware."}

An interesting way to understand GCNs is to think of them as a message passing mechanism where each node updates its representation by accepting information from its neighbours (also known as positive samples). However, beyond these neighbouring nodes, graphs have a large, dark, all-but forgotten world in which we find the non-neighbouring nodes (negative samples). In this paper, we show that this great dark world holds a substantial amount of information that might be useful for representation learning. Most specifically, it can provide negative information about the node representations. Our overall idea is to select appropriate negative samples for each node and incorporate the negative information contained in these samples into the representation updates. Moreover, we show that the process of selecting the negative samples is not trivial. Our theme therefore begins by describing the criteria for a good negative sample, followed by a determinantal point process algorithm for efficiently obtaining such samples. A GCN, boosted by diverse negative samples, then jointly considers the positive and negative information when passing messages. Experimental evaluations show that this idea not only improves the overall performance of standard representation learning but also significantly alleviates over-smoothing problems."}

However, these methods suffer from limited performance because of the hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method in downstream graph-related tasks due to their superior performance. Most GNNs are based on Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) frameworks. However, recent studies show that MPNNs can not exceed the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm in graph isomorphism test. To address the limitations of existing graph kernel and GNN methods, in this paper, we propose a novel GNN framework, termed Kernel Graph Neural Networks (KerGNNs), which integrates graph kernels into the message passing process of GNNs. Inspired by convolution filters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), KerGNNs adopt trainable hidden graphs as graph filters which are combined with subgraphs to update node embeddings using graph kernels. In addition, we show that MPNNs can be viewed as special cases of KerGNNs. We apply KerGNNs to multiple graph-related tasks and use cross-validation to make fair comparisons with benchmarks. We show that our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential to increase the representation ability of GNNs. We also show that the trained graph filters in KerGNNs can reveal the local graph structures of the dataset, which significantly improves the model interpretability compared with conventional GNN models."}

Unlike traditional networks, implicit networks solve a fixed point equation to compute inferences. Solving for the fixed point varies in complexity, depending on provided data and an error tolerance. Importantly, implicit networks may be trained with fixed memory costs in stark contrast to feedforward networks, whose memory requirements scale linearly with depth. However, there is no free  lunch --- backpropagation through implicit networks often requires solving a costly Jacobian-based equation arising from the implicit function theorem. We propose Jacobian-Free Backpropagation (JFB), a fixed-memory approach that circumvents the need to solve Jacobian-based equations. JFB makes implicit networks faster to train and significantly easier to implement, without sacrificing test accuracy. Our experiments show implicit networks trained with JFB are competitive with feedforward networks and prior implicit networks given the same number of parameters."}

Each specific task consists of multiple shared feature views collected from multiple sources, either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Common among recent approaches is to employ a typical hard/soft sharing strategy at the initial phase separately for each view across tasks to uncover common knowledge, underlying the assumption that all views are conditionally independent. On the one hand, multiple views across tasks possibly relate to each other under practical situations. On the other hand, supervised methods might be insufficient when labeled data is scarce. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel framework ASM2TV for semi-supervised multi-task multi-view learning. We present a new perspective named gating control policy, a learnable task-view-interacted sharing policy that adaptively selects the most desirable candidate shared block for any view across any task, which uncovers more fine-grained task-view-interacted relatedness and improves inference efficiency. Significantly, our proposed gathering consistency adaption procedure takes full advantage of large amounts of unlabeled fragmented time-series, making it a general framework that accommodates a wide range of applications. Experiments on two diverse real-world HAR benchmark datasets collected from various subjects and sources demonstrate our framework's superiority over other state-of-the-arts.

In light of this missing, we propose the very first framework that employs neural architecture search to automatic model design for private deep learning, dubbed as DPNAS. To integrate private learning with architecture search, a DP-aware approach is introduced for training candidate models composed on a delicately defined novel search space. We empirically certify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The searched model DPNASNet achieves state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs, e.g., for the privacy budget of (epsilon, delta)=(3, 1e-5), our model obtains test accuracy of 98.57% on MNIST, 88.09% on FashionMNIST, and 68.33% on CIFAR-10.

However, when training neural networks the loss function changes over (iteration) time due to the randomized selection of a subset of the samples. This randomization turns the optimization problem into a stochastic one. We propose to consider the loss as a noisy observation with respect to some reference optimum. This interpretation of the loss allows us to adopt Kalman filtering as an optimizer, as its recursive formulation is designed to estimate unknown parameters from noisy measurements. Moreover, we show that the Kalman Filter dynamical model for the evolution of the unknown parameters can be used to capture the gradient dynamics of advanced methods such as Momentum and Adam. We call this stochastic optimization method KOALA, which is short for Kalman Optimization Algorithm with Loss Adaptivity. KOALA is an easy to implement, scalable, and efficient method to train neural networks. We provide convergence analysis and show experimentally that it yields parameter estimates that are on par with or better than existing state of the art optimization algorithms across several neural network architectures and machine learning tasks, such as computer vision and language modeling.

In doing so, we decompose the heavy ball Gradient TD iterates into three separate iterates with different step sizes. We first analyze these iterates under one-timescale SA setting using results from current literature. However, the one-timescale case is restrictive and a more general analysis can be provided by looking at a three-timescale decomposition of the iterates. In the process we provide the first conditions for stability and convergence of general three-timescale SA. We then prove that the heavy ball Gradient TD algorithm is convergent using our three-timescale SA analysis. Finally, we evaluate these algorithms on standard RL problems and report improvement in performance over the vanilla algorithms."}

A neural network (NN) can also be used to compute the output distribution for continuous-domain, which can be viewed as an extension of regression task. Nevertheless, it is difficult to explicitly approximate a distribution without knowing the information of its general form a priori. In order to fit an arbitrary conditional distribution, discretizing the continuous domain into bins is an effective strategy, as long as we have sufficiently narrow bins and very large data. However, collecting enough data is often hard to reach and falls far short of that ideal in many circumstances, especially in multivariate CDE for the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of modeling free-form conditional distributions using a deconvolution-based neural net framework, coping with data deficiency problems in discretization. It has the advantage of being flexible but also takes advantage of the hierarchical smoothness offered by the deconvolution layers. We compare our method to a number of other density-estimation approaches and show that our Deconvolutional Density Network (DDN) outperforms the competing methods on many univariate and multivariate tasks.

Then, based on the percolation theory, we establish the relationship between these three types of instances and local homogeneous cluster (i.e., a set of instances with the same labels). Finally, we propose a method based on an accelerated k-means algorithm to construct local homogeneous clusters and remove the superfluous instances.

This is a very powerful method, but theoretical studies are limited. In this study, by combining the statistical learning theory and KAM theory, we provide a theoretical analysis of the behavior of Hamiltonian neural networks when the learning error is not completely zero. A Hamiltonian neural network with non-zero errors can be considered as a perturbation from the true dynamics, and the perturbation theory of the Hamilton equation is widely known as KAM theory. To apply KAM theory, we provide a generalization error bound for Hamiltonian neural networks by deriving an estimate of the covering number of the gradient of the multi-layer perceptron, which is the key ingredient of the model. This error bound gives a sup-norm bound on the Hamiltonian that is required in the application of KAM theory."}

In these instances, it is known that one needs GNNs of high depth, scaling at a polynomial rate with the number of nodes n, to provably encode the solution space, in turn affecting their statistical efficiency.    In this work we propose a new hybrid architecture to overcome this limitation. Our proposed architecture that we call as GNNplus networks involve a combination of multiple parallel low depth GNNs along with simple pooling layers involving low depth fully connected networks. We provably demonstrate that for many graph problems, the solution space can be encoded by GNNplus networks using depth that scales only poly-logarithmically in the number of nodes. This also has statistical advantages that we demonstrate via generalization bounds for GNNplus networks.

In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a novel algorithmic framework referred as RObust Training for Time-Series (RO-TS) to create robust deep models for time-series classification tasks. Specifically, we formulate a min-max optimization problem over the model parameters by explicitly reasoning about the robustness criteria in terms of additive perturbations to time-series inputs measured by the global alignment kernel (GAK) based distance.  We also show the generality and advantages of our formulation using the summation structure over time-series alignments by relating both GAK and dynamic time warping (DTW). This problem is an instance of a family of compositional min-max optimization problems, which are challenging and open with unclear theoretical guarantee.  We propose a principled stochastic compositional alternating gradient descent ascent (SCAGDA) algorithm for this family of optimization problems. Unlike traditional methods for time-series that require approximate computation of distance measures, SCAGDA approximates the GAK based distance on-the-fly using a moving average approach. We theoretically analyze the convergence rate of SCAGDA and provide strong theoretical support for the estimation of GAK based distance. Our experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that RO-TS creates more robust deep models when compared to adversarial training using prior methods that rely on data augmentation or new definitions of loss functions. We also demonstrate the importance of GAK for time-series data over the Euclidean distance."}

Unfortunately, current deep networks remain not only too compute-heavy for inference and training on edge devices, but also too large for communicating updates over bandwidth-constrained networks. In this paper, we develop, implement, and experimentally validate a novel FL framework termed Federated Dynamic Sparse Training (FedDST) by which complex neural networks can be deployed and trained with substantially improved efficiency in both on-device computation and in-network communication. At the core of FedDST is a dynamic process that extracts and trains sparse sub-networks from the target full network. With this scheme, \"two birds are killed with one stone:'' instead of full models, each client performs efficient training of its own sparse networks, and only sparse networks are transmitted between devices and the cloud. Furthermore, our results reveal that the dynamic sparsity during FL training more flexibly accommodates local heterogeneity in FL agents than the fixed, shared sparse masks. Moreover, dynamic sparsity naturally introduces an \"in-time self-ensembling effect'' into the training dynamics, and improves the FL performance even over dense training. In a realistic and challenging non i.i.d. FL setting, FedDST consistently outperforms competing algorithms in our experiments: for instance, at any fixed upload data cap on non-iid CIFAR-10, it gains an impressive accuracy advantage of 10% over FedAvgM when given the same upload data cap; the accuracy gap remains 3% even when FedAvgM is given 2 times the upload data cap, further demonstrating efficacy of FedDST.

The method presents itself as a generalization of simple gradient-based methods suitably scaled to achieve convergence to the optimizer in a fixed-time, independent of the initialization. We achieve this by first leveraging a continuous-time framework for designing fixed-time stable dynamical systems, and later providing a consistent discretization strategy, such that the equivalent discrete-time algorithm tracks the optimizer in a practically fixed number of iterations. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence behavior of the proposed gradient flows, and their robustness to additive disturbances for a range of functions obeying strong convexity, strict convexity, and possibly nonconvexity but satisfying the Polyak-Łojasiewicz inequality. We also show that the regret bound on the convergence rate is constant by virtue of the fixed-time convergence. The hyperparameters have intuitive interpretations and can be tuned to fit the requirements on the desired convergence rates. We validate the accelerated convergence properties of the proposed schemes on a range of numerical examples against the state-of-the-art optimization algorithms.

For graph cut based spectral clustering, it is common to model real-valued data into graph by modeling pairwise similarities using kernel function.  This is because the kernel function has a theoretical connection to the graph cut.  For problems where using multi-way similarities are more suitable than pairwise ones, it is natural to model as a hypergraph, which is generalization of a graph.  However, although the hypergraph cut is well-studied, there is not yet established a hypergraph cut based framework to model multi-way similarity.  In this paper, we formulate multi-way similarities by exploiting the theoretical foundation of kernel function.  We show a theoretical connection between our formulation and hypergraph cut in two ways, generalizing both weighted kernel k-means and the heat kernel, by which we justify our formulation.

A straightforward and widely used extension of Mixup is to combine with regional dropout-like methods: removing random patches from a sample and replacing it with the features from another sample. Albeit their simplicity and effectiveness, these methods are prone to create harmful samples due to their randomness. To address this issue, 'maximum saliency' strategies were recently proposed: they select only the most informative features to prevent such a phenomenon. However, they now suffer from lack of sample diversification as they always deterministically select regions with maximum saliency, injecting bias into the augmented data. In this paper, we present, a novel, yet simple Mixup-variant that captures the best of both worlds. Our idea is two-fold. By stochastically sampling the features and ‘grafting’ them onto another sample, our method effectively generates diverse yet meaningful samples. Its second ingredient is to produce the label of the grafted sample by mixing the labels in a saliency-calibrated fashion, which rectifies supervision misguidance introduced by the random sampling procedure. Our experiments under CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet datasets show that our scheme outperforms the current state-of-the-art augmentation strategies not only in terms of classification accuracy, but is also superior in coping under stress conditions such as data corruption and object occlusion."}

Since the mixup-based methods without special consideration of the context are prone to generate noisy samples, our method explicitly employs the node saliency information to select meaningful subgraphs and adaptively determine the labels. We extensively validate our method with diverse GNN architectures on multiple graph classification benchmark datasets from a wide range of graph domains of different sizes.

We estimate the probability of a model to fail if the attack is sampled from a certain distribution. Our theoretical findings are supported by experimental results on different datasets."}

In the medical domain, for instance, unveiling the mechanisms behind a disease often has higher priority than the diagnostic itself since it might dictate or guide potential treatments and research directions. One of the most popular approaches to explain model global predictions is the permutation importance where the performance on permuted data is benchmarked against the baseline. However, this method and other related approaches will undervalue the importance of a feature in the presence of covariates since these cover part of its provided information. To address this issue, we propose Covered Information Disentanglement CID, a framework that considers all feature information overlap to correct the values provided by permutation importance. We further show how to compute CID efficiently when coupled with Markov random fields. We demonstrate its efficacy in adjusting permutation importance first on a controlled toy dataset and discuss its effect on real-world medical data."}

We lack such a comparison point for Entity Linking. We construct a human benchmark on two standard datasets (TAC KBP 2010 and AIDA (YAGO)) to measure human accuracy. We find that current systems still fall short of human performance.    We present DeepType 2, a novel entity linking system that closes the gap. Our proposed approach overcomes shortcomings of previous type-based entity linking systems, and does not use pre-trained language models to reach this level. Three key innovations are responsible for DeepType 2's performance: 1) an abstracted representation of entities that favors shared learning and greater sample efficiency, 2) autoregressive entity features indicating type interactions (e.g. list type homogeneity, shared employers, geographical co-occurrence) with previous predictions that enable globally coherent document-wide predictions, 3) the entire model is trained end to end using a single entity-level maximum likelihood objective function. This is made possible by associating a context-specific score to each of the entity's abstract representation's sub-components (types), and summing these scores to form a candidate entity logit. In this paper, we explain how this factorization focuses the learning on the salient types of the candidate entities. Furthermore, we show how the scores can serve as a rationale for predictions.     The key contributions of this work are twofold: 1) we create the first human performance benchmark on standard benchmarks in entity linking (TAC KBP 2010 and AIDA (YAGO)) which will be made publicly available to support further analyses, 2) we obtain a new state of the art on these datasets and are the first to outperform humans on our benchmark. We perform model ablations to measure the contribution of the different facets of our system. We also include an analysis of human and algorithmic errors to provide insights into the causes, notably originating from journalistic style and historical context."}

Task-dependent embeddings rely on similarities between data samples to learn effective geometries. However, many popular time-series similarity measures are not valid distance metrics, and as a result they do not reliably capture the intricate relationships between the multi-variate time-series data samples for learning effective embeddings. One of the primary ways to formulate an accurate distance metric is by forming distance estimates via Monte-Carlo-based expectation evaluations. However, the high-dimensionality of the underlying distribution, and the inability to sample from it, pose significant challenges. To this end, we develop an Importance Sampling based distance metric -- I-SEA -- which enjoys the properties of a metric while consistently achieving superior performance for machine learning tasks such as classification and representation learning. I-SEA leverages Importance Sampling and Non-parametric Density Estimation to adaptively estimate distances, enabling implicit estimation from the underlying high-dimensional distribution, resulting in improved accuracy and reduced variance. We theoretically establish the properties of I-SEA and demonstrate its capabilities via experimental evaluations on real-world healthcare datasets."}

We present an adaptive, resource-aware, on-device learning mechanism, DISTREAL, which is able to fully and efficiently utilize the available resources on devices in a distributed manner, increasing the convergence speed. This is achieved with a dropout mechanism that dynamically adjusts the computational complexity of training an NN by randomly dropping filters of convolutional layers of the model. Our main contribution is the introduction of a design space exploration (DSE) technique, which finds Pareto-optimal per-layer dropout vectors with respect to resource requirements and convergence speed of the training. Applying this technique, each device is able to dynamically select the dropout vector that fits its available resource without requiring any assistance from the server. We implement our solution in a federated learning (FL) system, where the availability of computational resources varies both between devices and over time, and show through extensive evaluation that we are able to significantly increase the convergence speed over the state of the art without compromising on the final accuracy."}

To address this, we introduce a practical algorithm for incorporating human insight to speed learning. Our algorithm, Constraint Sampling Reinforcement Learning (CSRL), incorporates prior domain knowledge as constraints/restrictions on the RL policy. It takes in multiple potential policy constraints to maintain robustness to misspecification of individual constraints while leveraging helpful ones to learn quickly. Given a base RL learning algorithm (ex. UCRL, DQN, Rainbow) we propose an upper confidence with elimination scheme that leverages the relationship between the constraints, and their observed performance, to adaptively switch among them. We instantiate our algorithm with DQN-type algorithms and UCRL as base algorithms, and evaluate our algorithm in four environments, including three simulators based on real data: recommendations, educational activity sequencing, and HIV treatment sequencing. In all cases, CSRL learns a good policy faster than baselines."}

It is plausible that not all the data owned by each client is relevant to the server's learning objective. The updates incorporated from irrelevant data could be detrimental to the global model. The task of selecting relevant data is explored in traditional machine learning settings where the assumption is that all the data is available in one place. In FL settings, the data is distributed across multiple clients and the server can't introspect it. This precludes the application of traditional solutions to selecting relevant data here.  In this paper, we propose an approach called Federated Learning with Relevant Data (FLRD), that facilitates clients to derive updates using relevant data. Each client learns a model called Relevant Data Selector (RDS) that is private to itself to do the selection. This in turn helps in building an effective global model.  We perform experiments with multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of our solution. The results show (a) the capability of FLRD to identify relevant data samples at each client locally and (b) the superiority of the global model learned by FLRD over other baseline algorithms."}

Recent work has shown promising results for neural network models in the MIL setting. Instead of focusing on each instance, these models are trained in an end-to-end fashion to learn effective bag-level representations by suitably combining permutation invariant pooling techniques with neural architectures. In this paper, we consider modelling the interactions between bags using a graph and employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to facilitate end-to-end learning. Since a meaningful graph representing dependencies between bags is rarely available, we propose to use a Bayesian GNN framework that can generate a likely graph structure for scenarios where there is uncertainty in the graph or when no graph is available. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique for several MIL benchmark tasks and a distribution regression task."}

Although diverse MVML methods have been proposed over the last decade, most previous studies focus on leveraging the shared subspace across different views to represent the multi-view consensus information, while it is still an open issue whether such shared subspace representation is necessary when formulating the desired MVML model. In this paper, we propose a DeepGCN based View-Specific MVML method (D-VSM) which can bypass seeking for the shared subspace representation, and instead directly encoding the feature representation of each individual view through the deep GCN to couple with the information derived from the other views. Specifically, we first construct all instances under different feature representations into the corresponding feature graphs respectively, and then integrate them into a unified graph by integrating the different feature representations of each instance. Afterwards, the graph attention mechanism is adopted to aggregate and update all nodes on the unified graph to form structural representation for each instance, where both intra-view correlations and inter-view alignments have been jointly encoded to discover the underlying semantic relations. Finally, we derive a label confidence score for each instance by averaging the label confidence of its different feature representations with the multi-label soft margin loss. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

Retraining from scratch with the particular user's data omitted fully removes its influence on the resulting model, but comes with a high computational cost. Machine \"unlearning\" mitigates the cost incurred by full retraining: instead, models are updated incrementally, possibly only requiring retraining when approximation errors accumulate. Rapid progress has been made towards privacy guarantees on the indistinguishability of unlearned and retrained models, but current formalisms do not place practical bounds on computation. In this paper we demonstrate how an attacker can exploit this oversight, highlighting a novel attack surface introduced by machine unlearning. We consider an attacker aiming to increase the computational cost of data removal. We derive and empirically investigate a poisoning attack on certified machine unlearning where strategically designed training data triggers complete retraining when removed."}

A major obstacle is the unknown alignment of graphs, as well as the lack of accurate and inexpensive comparison metrics. In this work we introduce the filter graph distance. It is an optimal transport based distance which drives graph comparison through the probability distribution of filtered graph signals.   This creates a highly flexible distance, capable of prioritising different spectral information in observed graphs, offering a wide range of choices for a comparison metric. We tackle the problem of graph alignment by computing graph permutations that minimise our new filter distances, which implicitly solves the graph comparison problem.   We then propose a new approximate cost function that circumvents many computational difficulties inherent to graph comparison and permits the exploitation of fast algorithms such as mirror gradient descent, without grossly sacrificing the performance. We finally propose a novel algorithm derived from a stochastic version of mirror gradient descent, which accommodates the non-convexity of the alignment problem, offering a good trade-off between performance accuracy and speed. The experiments on graph alignment and classification show that the flexibility gained through filter graph distances can have a significant impact on performance, while the difference in speed offered by the approximation cost makes the framework applicable in practical settings."}

Many issues such as adversarial examples, out of distribution performance, Clever Hans phenomena, and the wider areas of AI evaluation and explainable AI, have to do with the following question: Did the system fail because it is a hard instance or because something else? In this paper we address this question with a generic method for estimating IRT-based instance difficulty for a wide range of AI domains covering several areas, from supervised feature-based classification to automated reasoning. We show how to estimate difficulty systematically using off-the-shelf machine learning regression models. We illustrate the usefulness of this estimation for a range of applications."}

A different idea has been recently proposed, named Friendly Training, which consists in altering the input data by adding an automatically estimated perturbation, with the goal of facilitating the learning process of a neural classifier. The transformation progressively fades-out as long as training proceeds, until it completely vanishes. In this work we revisit and extend this idea, introducing a radically different and novel approach inspired by the effectiveness of neural generators in the context of Adversarial Machine Learning. We propose an auxiliary multi-layer network that is responsible of altering the input data to make them easier to be handled by the classifier at the current stage of the training procedure.  The auxiliary network is trained jointly with the neural classifier, thus intrinsically increasing the 'depth' of the classifier, and it is expected to spot general regularities in the data alteration process. The effect of the auxiliary network is progressively reduced up to the end of training, when it is fully dropped and the classifier is deployed for applications. We refer to this approach as Neural Friendly Training.   An extended experimental procedure involving several datasets and different neural architectures shows that Neural Friendly Training overcomes the originally proposed Friendly Training technique, improving the generalization of the classifier, especially in the case of noisy data."}

We introduce Set-classifier with class-specific RIsk Bounds (SCRIB) to tackle this problem, assigning multiple labels to each example. Given the output of a black-box model on the validation set, SCRIB constructs a set-classifier that controls the class-specific prediction risks. The key idea is to reject when the set classifier returns more than one label. We validated SCRIB on several medical applications, including sleep staging on electroencephalogram(EEG) data, X-ray COVID image classification, and atrial fibrillation detection based on electrocardiogram (ECG) data.SCRIB obtained desirable class-specific risks, which are 35%-88% closer to the target risks than baseline methods."}

This problem is motivated from practical applications in domains including security (e.g., synthesizing packets for DNS amplification attacks), systems and networking (e.g., synthesizing workloads that trigger high resource usage), and machine learning (e.g., generating images from a rare class). Existing approaches are unsuitable, either requiring fully-labeled datasets or sacrificing the fidelity of the rare class for that of the common classes. We propose RareGAN, a novel synthesis of three key ideas: (1) extending conditional GANs to use labelled and unlabelled data for better generalization; (2) an active learning approach that requests the most useful labels; and (3) a weighted loss function to favor learning the rare class. We show that RareGAN achieves a better fidelity-diversity tradeoff on the rare class than prior work across different applications, budgets, rare class fractions, GAN losses, and architectures."}

It models the optimal scheduling of multiple sequences of tasks, each under a fixed order of operations, in which individual tasks require exclusive access to a predetermined resource for a specified processing time. The problem is NP-hard and computationally challenging even for medium-sized instances. Motivated by the increased stochasticity in production chains, this paper explores a deep learning approach to deliver efficient and accurate approximations to the JSP. In particular, this paper proposes the design of a deep neural network architecture to exploit the problem structure, its integration with Lagrangian duality to capture the problem constraints, and a post-processing optimization, to guarantee solution feasibility. The resulting method, called JSP-DNN, is evaluated on hard JSP instances from the JSPLIB benchmark library and is shown to produce JSP approximations of high quality at negligible computational costs."}

A traditional view of data acquisition is that, through iterations, knowledge from human labels and models is implicitly distilled to monotonically increase the accuracy and label consistency. Under this assumption, the most recently trained model is a good surrogate for the current labeled data, from which data acquisition is requested based on uncertainty/diversity. Our contribution is debunking this myth and proposing a new objective for distillation. First, we found example forgetting, which indicates the loss of knowledge learned across iterations. Second, for this reason, the last model is no longer the best teacher-- For mitigating such forgotten knowledge, we select one of its predecessor models as a teacher, by our proposed notion of \"consistency\". We show that this novel distillation is distinctive in the following three aspects; First, consistency ensures to avoid forgetting labels. Second, consistency improves both uncertainty/diversity of labeled data. Lastly, consistency redeems defective labels produced by human annotators."}

At the same time, many behaviors are highly adaptive and can be tailored to specific environments by means of learning. In this work, we use mathematical analysis and the framework of memory-based meta-learning (or ’learning to learn’) to answer when it is beneficial to learn such an adaptive strategy and when to hard-code a heuristic behavior. We find that the interplay of ecological uncertainty, task complexity and the agents’ lifetime has crucial effects on the meta-learned amortized Bayesian inference performed by an agent. There exist two regimes: One in which meta-learning yields a learning algorithm that implements task-dependent information-integration and a second regime in which meta-learning imprints a heuristic or ’hard-coded’ behavior. Further analysis reveals that non-adaptive behaviors are not only optimal for aspects of the environment that are stable across individuals, but also in situations where an adaptation to the environment would in fact be highly beneficial, but could not be done quickly enough to be exploited within the remaining lifetime. Hard-coded behaviors should hence not only be those that always work, but also those that are too complex to be learned within a reasonable time frame."}

The deployment of DNNs in safety-critical domains requires detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) data so that DNNs can abstain from making predictions on those. A number of methods have been recently developed for OOD detection, but there is still room for improvement. We propose the new method iDECODe, leveraging in-distribution equivariance for conformal OOD detection. It relies on a novel base non-conformity measure and a new aggregation method, used in the inductive conformal anomaly detection framework, thereby guaranteeing a bounded false detection rate. We demonstrate the efficacy of iDECODe by experiments on image and audio datasets, obtaining state-of-the-art results. We also show that iDECODe can detect adversarial examples.

While attempts have been made to extend Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to a simplicial complex setting, the methods do not inherently exploit, or reason about, the underlying topological structure of the network. We propose a graph convolutional model for learning functions parametrized by the k-homological features of simplicial complexes. By spectrally manipulating their combinatorial k-dimensional Hodge Laplacians, the proposed model enables learning topological features of the underlying simplicial complexes, specifically, the distance of each k-simplex from the nearest \"optimal\" k-th homology generator, effectively providing an alternative to homology localization."}

A key challenge in CL is catastrophic forgetting, which arises when performance on a previously mastered task is reduced when learning a new task. While a variety of methods exist to combat forgetting, in some cases tasks are fundamentally incompatible with each other and thus cannot be learnt by a single policy. This can occur, in reinforcement learning (RL) when an agent may be rewarded for achieving different goals from the same observation. In this paper we formalize this \"interference\" as distinct from the problem of forgetting. We show that existing CL methods based on single neural network predictors with shared replay buffers fail in the presence of interference. Instead, we propose a simple method, OWL, to address this challenge. OWL learns a factorized policy, using shared feature extraction layers, but separate heads, each specializing on a new task. The separate heads in OWL are used to prevent interference. At test time, we formulate policy selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, and show it is possible to select the best policy for an unknown task using feedback from the environment. The use of bandit algorithms allows the OWL agent to constructively re-use different continually learnt policies at different times during an episode. We show in multiple RL environments that existing replay based CL methods fail, while OWL is able to achieve close to optimal performance when training sequentially."}

Since this type of networks combines model-based traditional optimization algorithms, they have high interpretability. In addition, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are often used to explain deep neural networks, and provide some inspiration for designing innovative network models. In this paper, we transform DUNs into first-order ODE forms, and propose a high-order numerical architecture for ODE-inspired deep unfolding networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish the relationship between DUNs and ODEs. Moreover, we take two representative DUNs as examples, apply our architecture to them and design novel DUNs.

Current dominant approaches aim to generate pseudo-labels on weakly augmented instances and train models on their corresponding strongly augmented variants with high-confidence results. However, such methods are limited in excluding samples with low-confidence pseudo-labels and under-utilization of the label information. In this paper, we emphasize the cruciality of the label information and propose a Label-guided Self-training approach to Semi-supervised Learning (LaSSL), which improves pseudo-label generations from two mutually boosted strategies. First, with the ground-truth labels and iteratively-polished pseudo-labels, we explore instance relations among all samples and then minimize a class-aware contrastive loss to learn discriminative feature representations that make same-class samples gathered and different-class samples scattered. Second, on top of improved feature representations, we propagate the label information to the unlabeled samples across the potential data manifold at the feature-embedding level, which can further improve the labelling of samples with reference to their neighbours. These two strategies are seamlessly integrated and mutually promoted across the whole training process. We evaluate LaSSL on several classification benchmarks under partially labeled settings and demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art approaches."}

We adopt this viewpoint and model the actor and critic interaction as a two-player general-sum game with a leader-follower structure known as a Stackelberg game. Given this abstraction, we propose a meta-framework for Stackelberg actor-critic algorithms where the leader player follows the total derivative of its objective instead of the usual individual gradient. From a theoretical standpoint, we develop a policy gradient theorem for the refined update and provide a local convergence guarantee for the Stackelberg actor-critic algorithms to a local Stackelberg equilibrium. From an empirical standpoint, we demonstrate via simple examples that the learning dynamics we study mitigate cycling and accelerate convergence compared to the usual gradient dynamics given cost structures induced by actor-critic formulations. Finally, extensive experiments on OpenAI gym environments show that Stackelberg actor-critic algorithms always perform at least as well and often significantly outperform the standard actor-critic algorithm counterparts."}

Yet, how to generate informative, fixed dimensional features for graphs with varying size and topology can still be challenging. Typically, this is achieved through graph-pooling, which summarizes a graph by compressing all its nodes into a single vector. Is such a “collapsing-style” graph-pooling the only choice for graph classification? From complex system’s point of view, properties of a complex system arise largely from the interaction among its components. Therefore, we speculate that preserving the interacting relation between parts, instead of pooling them together, could benefit system level prediction. To verify this, we propose SLIM, a graph neural network model for Structural Landmarking and Interaction Modelling. The main idea is to compute a set of end-to-end optimizable sub-structure landmarks, so that any input graph can be projected onto these (spatially) local structural representatives for a faithful, global characterization. By doing so, explicit interaction between component parts of a graph can be leveraged directly in generating discriminative graph representation. Encouraging results are observed on benchmark datasets for graph classification, demonstrating the value of interaction modelling in the design of graph neural networks."}

However, heavy dependence on immediate reward feedback impedes the wide application of RL. On the other hand, imitation learning (IL) tackles RL without relying on environmental supervision by leveraging external demonstrations. In practice, however, collecting sufficient expert demonstrations can be prohibitively expensive, yet the quality of demonstrations typically limits the performance of the learning policy. To address a practical scenario, in this work, we propose Self-Adaptive Imitation Learning (SAIL), which, provided with a few demonstrations from a sub-optimal teacher, can perform well in RL tasks with extremely delayed rewards, where the only reward feedback is trajectory-wise ranking. SAIL bridges the advantages of IL and RL by interactively exploiting the demonstrations to catch up with the teacher and exploring the environment to yield demonstrations that surpass the teacher. Extensive empirical results show that not only does SAIL significantly improve the sample efficiency, but it also leads to higher asymptotic performance across different continuous control tasks, compared with the state-of-the-art."}

Pre-training based methods effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a feature extractor and then predicting novel classes via a cosine nearest neighbor classifier with mean-based prototypes. Nevertheless, due to the data scarcity, the mean-based prototypes are usually biased. In this paper, we attempt to diminish the prototype bias by regarding it as a prototype optimization problem. To this end, we propose a novel meta-learning based prototype optimization framework to rectify prototypes, i.e., introducing a meta-optimizer to optimize prototypes. Although the existing meta-optimizers can also be adapted to our framework, they all overlook a crucial gradient bias issue, i.e., the mean-based gradient estimation is also biased on sparse data. To address the issue, we regard the gradient and its flow as meta-knowledge and then propose a novel Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)-based meta-optimizer to polish prototypes, called MetaNODE. In this meta-optimizer, we first view the mean-based prototypes as initial prototypes, and then model the process of prototype optimization as continuous-time dynamics specified by a Neural ODE.

Most of these studies put the perspective on isolated markets, relying on the knowledge of certain market to maximize the prediction performance. However, these market-specific approaches are restricted by the knowledge limitation of isolated markets and incapable of the complicated and potential relations among different markets, especially some with strong dependence such as the financing market and sales market. Fortunately, we discover potentially symbiotic relations between the financing market and the sales market, which provides us with an opportunity to co-promote the popularity predictions of both markets. Thus, for bridgly learning the knowledge interactions between financing market and sales market, we propose a cross-market approach, namely CATN: Cooperative-competitive Attention Transfer Network, which could effectively transfer knowledge of financing capability from the crowdfunding market and sales prospect from the E-commerce market. Specifically, for capturing the complicated relations especially the cooperation or complement of items and enhancing the knowledge transfer between the two heterogeneous markets, we design a novel Cooperative Attention; meanwhile, for finely computing the relations of items especially the competition in specific same market, we further design Competitive Attentions for the two markets respectively. Besides, we also distinguish aligned features and unique features to adapt the cross-market predictions. With the real-world datasets collected from Indiegogo and Amazon, we construct extensive experiments on three types of datasets from the two markets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our CATN model."}

Existing explanation methods mainly focus on post-hoc explanations where another explanatory model is employed to provide explanations for a trained GNN. The fact that post-hoc methods fail to reveal the original reasoning process of GNNs raises the need of building GNNs with built-in interpretability. In this work, we propose Prototype Graph Neural Network (ProtGNN), which combines prototype learning with GNNs and provides a new perspective on the explanations of GNNs. In ProtGNN, the explanations are naturally derived from the case-based reasoning process and are actually used during classification. The prediction of ProtGNN is obtained by comparing the inputs to a few learned prototypes in the latent space.  Furthermore, for better interpretability and higher efficiency, a novel conditional subgraph sampling module is incorporated to indicate which part of the input graph is most similar to each prototype in ProtGNN+. Finally, we evaluate our method on a wide range of datasets and perform concrete case studies. Extensive results show that ProtGNN and ProtGNN+ can provide inherent interpretability while achieving accuracy on par with the non-interpretable counterparts."}

Poisoning attacks target either the availability or integrity of a model. The availability attack aims to degrade the overall accuracy while the integrity attack causes misclassification only for specific instances without affecting the accuracy of clean data. Although clean-label integrity attacks are proven to be effective in recent studies, the feasibility of clean-label availability attacks remains unclear. This paper, for the first time, proposes a clean-label approach, CLPA, for the poisoning availability attack. We reveal that due to the intrinsic imperfection of classifiers, naturally misclassified inputs can be considered as a special type of poisoned data, which we refer to as \"natural poisoned data''. We then propose a two-phase generative adversarial net (GAN) based poisoned data generation framework along with a triplet loss function for synthesizing clean-label poisoned samples that locate in a similar distribution as natural poisoned data. The generated poisoned data are plausible to human perception and can also bypass the singular vector decomposition (SVD) based defense. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet dataset over a variety type of models. Codes are available at: https://github.com/bxz9200/CLPA."}

However, the inaccessible local training data and uninspectable local training process make FL susceptible to various Byzantine attacks (e.g., data poisoning and model poisoning attacks), aiming to manipulate the FL model training process and degrade the model performance. Most of the existing Byzantine-robust FL schemes cannot effectively defend against stealthy poisoning attacks that craft poisoned models statistically similar to benign models. Things worsen when many clients are compromised or data among clients are highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). In this work, to address these issues, we propose FedInv, a novel Byzantine-robust FL framework by inversing local model updates. Specifically, in each round of local model aggregation in FedInv, the parameter server first inverses the local model updates submitted by each client to generate a corresponding dummy dataset. Then, the server identifies those dummy datasets with exceptional Wasserstein distances from others and excludes the related local model updates from model aggregation. We conduct an exhaustive experimental evaluation of FedInv. The results demonstrate that FedInv significantly outperforms the existing robust FL schemes in defending against stealthy poisoning attacks under highly non-IID data partitions."}

However, recent studies have demonstrated that these models are vulnerable to adversarial attack, exposing a risk-of-use in critical applications where untrusted parties have access to the data environment or even directly to the sensor inputs. Existing adversarial defense methods are either limited to specific types of attacks or are too complex to be applied to practical vision models. More importantly, these methods rely on techniques that are not interpretable to humans. In this work, we argue that an effective defense should produce an explanation as to why the system is attacked, and by using a representation that is easily readable by a human user, e.g. a logic formalism. To this end, we propose logic adversarial defense (LogicDef), a defense framework that utilizes the scene graph of the image to provide a contextual structure for detecting and explaining object classification. Our framework first mines inductive logic rules from the extracted scene graph, and then uses these rules to construct a defense model that alerts the user when the vision model violates the consistency rules. The defense model is interpretable and its robustness is further enhanced by incorporating existing relational commonsense knowledge from projects such as ConceptNet. In order to handle the hierarchical nature of such relational reasoning, we use a curriculum learning approach based on object taxonomy, yielding additional improvements to training and performance."}

In this work, we conduct FSIL problem under the union of above settings and introduce a novel stage conscious attention network (SCAN) to retrieve knowledge from few demonstrations simultaneously. SCAN uses an attention module to identify each stage in length-variant demonstrations.

Among various model compression approaches, high-order tensor decomposition is particularly attractive and useful because the decomposed model is very small and fully structured. For this category of approaches, tensor ranks are the most important hyper-parameters that directly determine the architecture and task performance of the compressed DNN models. However, as an NP-hard problem, selecting optimal tensor ranks under the desired budget is very challenging and the state-of-the-art studies suffer from unsatisfied compression performance and timing-consuming search procedures. To systematically address this fundamental problem, in this paper we propose BATUDE, a Budget-Aware TUcker DEcomposition-based compression approach that can efficiently calculate optimal tensor ranks via one-shot training. By integrating the rank selecting procedure to the DNN training process with a specified compression budget, the tensor ranks of the DNN models are learned from the data and thereby bringing very significant improvement on both compression ratio and classification accuracy for the compressed models. The experimental results on ImageNet dataset show that our method enjoys 0.33% top-5 higher accuracy with 2.52X less computational cost as compared to the uncompressed ResNet-18 model. For ResNet-50, the proposed approach enables 0.37% and 0.55% top-5 accuracy increase with 2.97X and 2.04X computational cost reduction, respectively, over the uncompressed model."}

Most of the existing contrastive learning methods employ pre-defined view generation methods, e.g., node drop or edge perturbation, which usually cannot adapt to input data or preserve the original semantic structures well. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named Automated Graph Contrastive Learning (AutoGCL) in this paper. Specifically, AutoGCL employs a set of learnable graph view generators orchestrated by an auto augmentation strategy, where every graph view generator learns a probability distribution of graphs conditioned by the input. While the graph view generators in AutoGCL preserve the most representative structures of the original graph in generation of every contrastive sample, the auto augmentation learns policies to introduce adequate augmentation variances in the whole contrastive learning procedure. Furthermore, AutoGCL adopts a joint training strategy to train the learnable view generators, the graph encoder, and the classifier in an end-to-end manner, resulting in topological heterogeneity yet semantic similarity in the generation of contrastive samples. Extensive experiments on semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer learning demonstrate the superiority of our AutoGCL framework over the state-of-the-arts in graph contrastive learning. In addition, the visualization results further confirm that the learnable view generators can deliver more compact and semantically meaningful contrastive samples compared against the existing view generation methods.

However, it often requires huge efforts to adapt DNNs to individual multimodal tasks by manually engineering unimodal features and designing multimodal feature fusion strategies. This paper proposes Bilevel Multimodal Neural Architecture Search (BM-NAS) framework, which makes the architecture of multimodal fusion models fully searchable via a bilevel searching scheme. At the upper level, BM-NAS selects the inter/intra-modal feature pairs from the pretrained unimodal backbones. At the lower level, BM-NAS learns the fusion strategy for each feature pair, which is a combination of predefined primitive operations. The primitive operations are elaborately designed and they can be flexibly combined to accommodate various effective feature fusion modules such as multi-head attention (Transformer) and Attention on Attention (AoA). Experimental results on three multimodal tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed BM-NAS framework.

However, it remains notoriously challenging to train and inference GCNs over large graph datasets, limiting their application to large real-world graphs and hindering the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN graphs. This is because as the graph size grows, the sheer number of node features and the large adjacency matrix can easily explode the required memory and data movements. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we explore the possibility of drawing lottery tickets when sparsifying GCN graphs, i.e., subgraphs that largely shrink the adjacency matrix yet are capable of achieving accuracy comparable to or even better than their full graphs. Specifically, we for the first time discover the existence of graph early-bird (GEB) tickets that emerge at the very early stage when sparsifying GCN graphs, and propose a simple yet effective detector to automatically identify the emergence of such GEB tickets. Furthermore, we advocate graph-model co-optimization and develop a generic efficient GCN early-bird training framework dubbed GEBT that can significantly boost the efficiency of GCN training by (1) drawing joint early-bird tickets between the GCN graphs and models and (2) enabling simultaneously sparsification of both the GCN graphs and models. Experiments on various GCN models and datasets consistently validate our GEB finding and the effectiveness of our GEBT, e.g., our GEBT achieves up to 80.2% ~ 85.6% and 84.6% ~ 87.5% savings of GCN training and inference costs while offering a comparable or even better accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Backpropagation is not directly applicable, nor are the reparameterization tricks used in networks with continuous stochastic variables. To address this challenge, we present Hindsight Network Credit Assignment (HNCA), a novel gradient estimation algorithm for networks of discrete stochastic units. HNCA works by assigning credit to each unit based on the degree to which its output influences its immediate children in the network. We prove that HNCA produces unbiased gradient estimates with reduced variance compared to the REINFORCE estimator, while the computational cost is similar to that of backpropagation. We first apply HNCA in a contextual bandit setting to optimize a reward function that is unknown to the agent. In this setting, we empirically demonstrate that HNCA significantly outperforms REINFORCE, indicating that the variance reduction implied by our theoretical analysis is significant and impactful. We then show how HNCA can be extended to optimize a more general function of the outputs of a network of stochastic units, where the function is known to the agent. We apply this extended version of HNCA to train a discrete variational auto-encoder and empirically show it compares favourably to other strong methods. We believe that the ideas underlying HNCA can help stimulate new ways of thinking about efficient credit assignment in stochastic compute graphs."}

However, powerful ViTs are often too computationally expensive to be fitted onto real-world resource-constrained platforms, due to (1) their quadratically increased complexity with the number of input tokens and (2) their overparameterized self-attention heads and model depth. In parallel, different images are of varied complexity and their different regions can contain various levels of visual information, e.g., a sky background is not as informative as a foreground object in object classification tasks, indicating that treating those regions equally in terms of model complexity is unnecessary while such opportunities for trimming down ViTs' complexity have not been fully exploited.  To this end, we propose a Multi-grained Input-Adaptive Vision Transformer framework dubbed MIA-Former that can input-adaptively adjust the structure of ViTs at three coarse-to-fine-grained granularities (i.e., model depth and the number of model heads/tokens).  In particular, our MIA-Former adopts a low-cost network trained with a hybrid supervised and reinforcement learning method to skip the unnecessary layers, heads, and tokens in an input adaptive manner, reducing the overall computational cost. Furthermore, an interesting side effect of our MIA-Former is that its resulting ViTs are naturally equipped with improved robustness against adversarial attacks over their static counterparts, because MIA-Former's multi-grained dynamic control improves the model diversity similar to the effect of ensemble and thus increases the   difficulty of adversarial attacks against all its sub-models.  Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that the proposed MIA-Former framework can (1) effectively allocate adaptive computation budgets to the difficulty of input images, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, e.g., up to 16.5% computation savings with the same or even a higher accuracy compared with the SOTA dynamic transformer models, and (2) boost ViTs' robustness accuracy under various adversarial attacks over their vanilla counterparts by 2.4% and 3.0%, respectively.

Unlike existing methods, TS2Vec performs contrastive learning in a hierarchical way over augmented context views, which enables a robust contextual representation for each timestamp. Furthermore, to obtain the representation of an arbitrary sub-sequence in the time series, we can apply a simple aggregation over the representations of corresponding timestamps. We conduct extensive experiments on time series classification tasks to evaluate the quality of time series representations. As a result, TS2Vec achieves significant improvement over existing SOTAs of unsupervised time series representation on 125 UCR datasets and 29 UEA datasets. The learned timestamp-level representations also achieve superior results in time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. A linear regression trained on top of the learned representations outperforms previous SOTAs of time series forecasting.

Recent research usually suggests retraining a model from scratch with remaining training data or refining the model by reverting the model optimization on the marked data points. Unfortunately, aside from their computational inefficiency, those approaches inevitably hurt the resulting model's generalization ability since they remove not only unique characteristics but also discard shared (and possibly contributive) information. To address the performance degradation problem, this paper presents a novel approach called Performance Unchanged Model Augmentation (PUMA). The proposed PUMA framework explicitly models the influence of each training data point on the model's generalization ability with respect to various performance criteria. It then complements the negative impact of removing marked data by reweighting the remaining data optimally. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the PUMA framework, we compared it with multiple state-of-the-art data removal techniques in the experiments, where we show the PUMA can effectively and efficiently remove the unique characteristics of marked training data without retraining the model that can 1) fool a membership attack, and 2) resist performance degradation. In addition, as PUMA estimates the data importance during its operation, we show it could serve to debug mislabelled data points more efficiently than existing approaches."}

However, there is still enormous potential to be tapped to reach the fully supervised performance. In this paper, we present a novel active learning strategy to assist knowledge transfer in the target domain, dubbed active domain adaptation. We start from an observation that energy-based models exhibit free energy biases when training (source) and test (target) data come from different distributions. Inspired by this inherent mechanism, we empirically reveal that a simple yet efficient energy-based sampling strategy sheds light on selecting the most valuable target samples than existing approaches requiring particular architectures or computation of the distances. Our algorithm, Energy-based Active Domain Adaptation (EADA), queries groups of target data that incorporate both domain characteristic and instance uncertainty into every selection round. Meanwhile, by aligning the free energy of target data compact around the source domain via a regularization term, domain gap can be implicitly diminished. Through extensive experiments, we show that EADA surpasses state-of-the-art methods on well-known challenging benchmarks with substantial improvements, making it a useful option in the open world.

In this paper, we propose a universal paradigm called GearNet to exploit bilateral relationships between the two domains. Specifically, we take the two domains as different inputs to train two models alternately, and a symmetrical Kullback-Leibler loss is used for selectively matching the predictions of the two models in the same domain. This interactive learning schema enables implicit label noise canceling and exploit correlations between the source and target domains. Therefore, our GearNet has the great potential to boost the performance of a wide range of existing WSDA methods.

In this work, we propose a State-aware Multi-aspect Interests representation Network (SMINet) for cold-start users recommendation at OTPs, which consists of a multi-aspect interests extractor, a co-attention layer, and a state-aware gating layer. The key component of the model is the multi-aspect interests extractor, which is able to extract representations for the user's multi-aspect interests. Furthermore, to learn the interactions between the user behaviors in the current session and the above multi-aspect interests, we carefully design a co-attention layer which allows the cross attentions between the two modules. Additionally, we propose a travel state-aware gating layer to attentively select the multi-aspect interests. The final user representation is obtained by fusing the three components.

Both follow a model-to-data scenario; clients train and test machine learning models without sharing raw data. SL provides better model privacy than FL due to the machine learning model architecture split between clients and the server. Moreover, the split model makes SL a better option for resource-constrained environments. However, SL performs slower than FL due to the relay-based training across multiple clients. In this regard, this paper presents a novel approach, named splitfed learning (SFL), that amalgamates the two approaches eliminating their inherent drawbacks, along with a refined architectural configuration incorporating differential privacy and PixelDP to enhance data privacy and model robustness. Our analysis and empirical results demonstrate that (pure) SFL provides similar test accuracy and communication efficiency as SL while significantly decreasing its computation time per global epoch than in SL for multiple clients. Furthermore, as in SL, its communication efficiency over FL improves with the number of clients. Besides, the performance of SFL with privacy and robustness measures is further evaluated under extended experimental settings."}

In general, closed form solutions are not available and numerical approximation schemes are computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose to approach the solution of PDEs based on a novel technique that combines the advantages of two recently emerging machine learning based approaches.  First, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) learn continuous solutions of PDEs and can be trained with little to no ground truth data. However, PINNs do not generalize well to unseen domains. Second, convolutional neural networks provide fast inference and generalize but either require large amounts of training data or a physics-constrained loss based on finite differences that can lead to inaccuracies and discretization artifacts.  We leverage the advantages of both of these approaches by using Hermite spline kernels in order to continuously interpolate a grid-based state representation that can be handled by a CNN. This allows for training without any precomputed training data using a physics-informed loss function only and provides fast, continuous solutions that generalize to unseen domains.  We demonstrate the potential of our method at the examples of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation and the damped wave equation. Our models are able to learn several intriguing phenomena such as Karman vortex streets, the Magnus effect, Doppler effect, interference patterns and wave reflections. Our quantitative assessment and an interactive real-time demo show that we are narrowing the gap in accuracy of unsupervised ML based methods to industrial solvers for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) while being orders of magnitude faster."}

In H-SGD, before each global aggregation, workers send their updated local models to local servers for aggregations. Despite recent research efforts, the effect of local aggregation on global convergence still lacks theoretical understanding. In this work, we first introduce a new notion of \"upward\" and \"downward\" divergences. We then use it to conduct a novel analysis to obtain a worst-case convergence upper bound for two-level H-SGD with non-IID data, non-convex objective function, and stochastic gradient. By extending this result to the case with random grouping, we observe that this convergence upper bound of H-SGD is between the upper bounds of two single-level local SGD settings, with the number of local iterations equal to the local and global update periods in H-SGD, respectively. We refer to this as the \"sandwich behavior\". Furthermore, we extend our analytical approach based on \"upward\" and \"downward\" divergences to study the convergence for the general case of H-SGD with more than two levels, where the \"sandwich behavior\" still holds. Our theoretical results provide key insights of why local aggregation can be beneficial in improving the convergence of H-SGD."}

Since biological systems can overcome the above difficulties very well, individuals inherit an innate gene from collective creatures that have evolved over hundreds of millions of years and then learn new skills through few examples. Inspired by this, we propose a practical collective-individual paradigm where an evolution (expandable) network is trained on sequential tasks and then recognize unknown classes in real-world. Moreover, the learngene, i.e., the gene for learning initialization rules of the target model, is proposed to inherit the meta-knowledge from the collective model and reconstruct a lightweight individual model on the target task. Particularly, a novel criterion is proposed to discover learngene in the collective model, according to the gradient information. Finally, the individual model is trained only with few samples on the target learning tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in an extensive empirical study and theoretical analysis."}

However, their ability to achieve stronger forms of generalization remains unclear. We consider the problem of symbolic mathematical integration, as it requires generalizing systematically beyond the training set. We develop a methodology for evaluating generalization that takes advantage of the problem domain's structure and access to a verifier. Despite promising in-distribution performance of sequence-to-sequence models in this domain, we demonstrate challenges in achieving robustness, compositionality, and out-of-distribution generalization, through both carefully constructed manual test suites and a genetic algorithm that automatically finds large collections of failures in a controllable manner. Our investigation highlights the difficulty of generalizing well with the predominant modeling and learning approach, and the importance of evaluating beyond the test set, across different aspects of generalization."}

However, as state-of-the-art neural networks grow larger, the computational cost associated with training several independent networks becomes expensive. We introduce a fast, low-cost method for creating diverse ensembles of neural networks without needing to train multiple models from scratch. We do this by first training a single parent network. We then create child networks by cloning the parent and dramatically pruning the parameters of each child to create an ensemble of members with unique and diverse topologies. We then briefly train each child network for a small number of epochs, which now converge significantly faster when compared to training from scratch. We explore various ways to maximize diversity in the child networks, including the use of anti-random pruning and one-cycle tuning. This diversity enables \"Prune and Tune\" ensembles to achieve results that are competitive with traditional ensembles at a fraction of the training cost. We benchmark our approach against state of the art low-cost ensemble methods and display marked improvement in both accuracy and uncertainty estimation on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100."}

However, existing methods often lack the essential ability to generate examples with requested properties, such as the age of the person in the photo or the weight of the generated molecule. Incorporating such additional conditioning factors would require rebuilding the entire architecture and optimizing the parameters from scratch. Moreover, it is difficult to disentangle selected attributes so that to perform edits of only one attribute while leaving the others unchanged. To overcome these limitations we propose PluGeN (Plugin Generative Network), a simple yet effective generative technique that can be used as a plugin to pre-trained generative models. The idea behind our approach is to transform the entangled latent representation using a flow-based module into a multi-dimensional space where the values of each attribute are modeled as an independent one-dimensional distribution. In consequence, PluGeN can generate new samples with desired attributes as well as manipulate labeled attributes of existing examples. Due to the disentangling of the latent representation, we are even able to generate samples with rare or unseen combinations of attributes in the dataset, such as a young person with gray hair, men with make-up, or women with beards. We combined PluGeN with GAN and VAE models and applied it to conditional generation and manipulation of images and chemical molecule modeling. Experiments demonstrate that PluGeN preserves the quality of backbone models while adding the ability to control the values of labeled attributes. Implementation is available at https://github.com/gmum/plugen."}

In this paper, we move forward to refine novel-class features by finetuning a trained deep network. Finetuning is designed to focus on reducing biases in novel-class feature distributions, which we define as two aspects: class-agnostic and class-specific biases. Class-agnostic bias is defined as the distribution shifting introduced by domain difference, which we propose Distribution Calibration Module(DCM) to reduce. DCM owes good property of eliminating domain difference and fast feature adaptation during optimization. Class-specific bias is defined as the biased estimation using a few samples in novel classes, which we propose Selected Sampling(SS) to reduce. Without inferring the actual class distribution, SS is designed by running sampling using proposal distributions around support-set samples. By powering finetuning with DCM and SS, we achieve state-of-the-art results on Meta-Dataset with consistent performance boosts over ten datasets from different domains. We believe our simple yet effective method demonstrates its possibility to be applied on practical few-shot applications."}

However, little work was dedicated to creating unbiased GNNs, i.e., where the classification is uncorrelated with sensitive attributes, such as race or gender. Some ignore the sensitive attributes or optimize for the criteria of statistical parity for fairness. However, it has been shown that neither approaches ensure fairness, but rather cripple the utility of the prediction task. In this work, we present a GNN framework that allows optimizing representations for the notion of Equalized Odds fairness criteria. The architecture is composed of three components: (1) a GNN classifier predicting the utility class, (2) a sampler learning the distribution of the sensitive attributes of the nodes given their labels. It generates samples fed into a (3) discriminator that discriminates between true and sampled sensitive attributes using a novel ``permutation loss'' function. Using these components, we train a model to neglect information regarding the sensitive attribute only with respect to its label. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to optimize GNNs for the equalized odds criteria. We evaluate our classifier over several graph datasets and sensitive attributes and show our algorithm reaches state-of-the-art results."}

The common approach for tackling this problem is replication which assigns the same prediction task to multiple workers. This approach, however, is  inefficient and incurs significant resource overheads. Hence, a learning-based approach known as parity model (ParM) has been recently proposed which learns models that can generate ``parities’’ for a group of predictions  to reconstruct the predictions of the slow/failed workers. While this learning-based approach is more resource-efficient than replication, it is tailored to the specific model hosted by the cloud and is particularly suitable for a small number of queries (typically less than four) and tolerating very few stragglers (mostly one). Moreover, ParM does not handle Byzantine adversarial workers. We propose a different approach, named Approximate Coded Inference (ApproxIFER), that does not require training any parity models, hence it is agnostic to the model hosted by the cloud and can be readily applied to different data domains and model architectures. Compared with earlier works, ApproxIFER can handle a general number of stragglers and scales significantly better with the  number of queries. Furthermore, ApproxIFER is robust against Byzantine workers. Our extensive experiments on a large number of datasets and model architectures show significant degraded mode accuracy improvement by up to 58% over ParM."}

Many studies improve sample efficiency by extending adversarial imitation to be off-policy regardless of the fact that these off-policy extensions could either change the original objective or involve complicated optimization. We revisit the foundation of adversarial imitation and propose an off-policy sample efficient approach that requires no adversarial training or min-max optimization. Our formulation capitalizes on two key insights: (1) the similarity between the Bellman equation and the stationary state-action distribution equation allows us to derive a novel temporal difference (TD) learning approach; and (2) the use of a deterministic policy simplifies the TD learning. Combined, these insights yield a practical algorithm, Deterministic and Discriminative Imitation (D2-Imitation), which oper- ates by first partitioning samples into two replay buffers and then learning a deterministic policy via off-policy reinforcement learning. Our empirical results show that D2-Imitation is effective in achieving good sample efficiency, outperforming several off-policy extension approaches of adversarial imitation on many control tasks."}

For example, clients may differ in terms of data distribution, network latency, input/output space, and/or model architecture, which can easily lead to the misalignment of their local gradients. To improve the tolerance to heterogeneity, we propose a novel federated prototype learning (FedProto) framework in which the clients and server communicate the abstract class prototypes instead of the gradients. FedProto aggregates the local prototypes collected from different clients, and then sends the global prototypes back to all clients to regularize the training of local models. The training on each client aims to minimize the classification error on the local data while keeping the resulting local prototypes sufficiently close to the corresponding global ones. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis to the convergence rate of FedProto under non-convex objectives. In experiments, we propose a benchmark setting tailored for heterogeneous FL, with FedProto outperforming several recent FL approaches on multiple datasets."}

Such an extension enables PeVFA to preserve values of multiple policies at the same time and brings an appealing characteristic, i.e., value generalization among policies. We formally analyze the value generalization under Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI). From theoretical and empirical lens, we show that generalized value estimates offered by PeVFA may have lower initial approximation error to true values of successive policies, which is expected to improve consecutive value approximation during GPI. Based on above clues, we introduce a new form of GPI with PeVFA which leverages the value generalization along policy improvement path. Moreover, we propose a representation learning framework for RL policy, providing several approaches to learn effective policy embeddings from policy network parameters or state-action pairs. In our experiments, we evaluate the efficacy of value generalization offered by PeVFA and policy representation learning in several OpenAI Gym continuous control tasks. For a representative instance of algorithm implementation, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) re-implemented under the paradigm of GPI with PeVFA achieves about 40% performance improvement on its vanilla counterpart in most environments."}

HoD-Net is based on and generalizes the complex-step finite difference (CSFD) method. While similar to classic finite difference, CSFD approaches the derivative of a function from a higher-dimension complex domain, leading to highly accurate and robust differentiation computation without numerical stability issues. This method can be coupled with backpropagation and adjoint perturbation methods for an efficient calculation of high-order derivatives. We show how this numerical scheme can be leveraged in challenging deep learning problems, such as high-order network training, deep learning-based physics simulation, and neural differential equations."}

Theoretical results show that both are Turing-complete and can represent any context-free language (CFL).In practice, it is often observed that Transformer models have better representation power than LSTM. But the reason is barely understood. We study such practical differences between LSTM and Transformer and propose an explanation based on their latent space decomposition patterns. To achieve this goal, we introduce an oracle training paradigm, which forces the decomposition of the latent representation of LSTMand the Transformer and supervises with the transitions of the Pushdown Automaton (PDA) of the corresponding CFL. With the forced decomposition, we show that the performance upper bounds of LSTM and Transformer in learning CFL are close: both of them can simulate a stack and perform stack operation along with state transitions. However, the absence of forced decomposition leads to the failure of LSTM models to capture the stack and stack operations, while having a marginal impact on the Transformer model. Lastly, we connect the experiment on the prototypical PDA to a real-world parsing task to re-verify the conclusions"}

As 3D data is increasingly used in vision tasks such as robots, autonomous driving and drones, the internal robustness of the classification models for 3D point cloud has received widespread attention. In this paper, we propose a novel method named SPGA (Shape Prior Guided Attack) to generate adversarial point cloud examples. We use shape prior information to make perturbations sparser and thus achieve imperceptible attacks. In particular, we propose a Spatially Logical Block (SLB) to apply adversarial points through sliding in the oriented bounding box. Moreover, we design an algorithm called FOFA for this type of task, which further refines the adversarial attack in the process of breaking down complicated problems into sub-problems. Compared with the methods of global perturbation, our attack method consumes significantly fewer computations, making it more efficient. Most importantly of all, SPGA can generate examples with a higher attack success rate (even in a defensive situation), less perturbation budget and stronger transferability."}

Apart from their computational advantages, by working in the spectral domain random Fourier features expose the translation invariant kernel as a density function that may, in principle, be manipulated directly to tune the kernel.  In this paper we propose selecting the density function from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space to allow us to search the space of all translation-invariant kernels.  Our approach, which we call tuned random features (TRF), achieves this by approximating the density function as the RKHS-norm regularised least-squares best fit to an unknown ``true'' optimal density function, resulting in a RFF formulation where kernel selection is reduced to regularised risk minimisation with a novel regulariser.  We derive bounds on the Rademacher complexity for our method showing that our random features approximation method converges to optimal kernel selection in the large N,D limit.  Finally, we prove experimental results for a variety of real-world learning problems, demonstrating the performance of our approach compared to comparable methods."}

Specifically, we propose a momentum-based decentralized policy gradient tracking (MDPGT) where a new momentum-based variance reduction technique is used to approximate the local policy gradient surrogate with importance sampling, and an intermediate parameter is adopted to track two consecutive policy gradient surrogates. MDPGT provably achieves the best available sample complexity of O(N -1 e -3) for converging to an e-stationary point of the global average of N local performance functions (possibly nonconcave). This outperforms the state-of-the-art sample complexity in decentralized model-free reinforcement learning and when initialized with a single trajectory, the sample complexity matches those obtained by the existing decentralized policy gradient methods. We further validate the theoretical claim for the Gaussian policy function. When the required error tolerance e is small enough, MDPGT leads to a linear speed up, which has been previously established in decentralized stochastic optimization, but not for reinforcement learning. Lastly, we provide empirical results on a multi-agent reinforcement learning benchmark environment to support our theoretical findings."}

While many MAPF solvers that provide some of these properties exist, none provides them all. To fill this need, we propose a new MAPF framework, the shard system. A shard system partitions the workspace into geographic regions, called shards, linked by a novel system of buffers. Agents are routed optimally within a shard by a local controller to local goals set by a global controller. The buffer system novelly allows shards to plan with perfect parallelism, providing scalability. A novel global controller algorithm can rapidly generate an inter-shard routing plan for thousands of agents while minimizing the traffic routed through any shard. A novel workspace partitioning algorithm produces shards small enough to replan rapidly. These innovations allow a shard system to adjust its routing plan in real time if an agent is delayed or assigned a new goal, enabling robust, persistent MAPF. A shard system's local optimality and optimized inter-shard routing bring the sum-of-costs of its solutions to single-shot MAPF problems to < 20-60% of optimal on a diversity of workspaces. Its scalability allows it to plan paths for 1000s of agents in seconds. If any of their goals change or move actions fails, a shard system can replan in under a second."}

Fixed points of such dynamical systems represent configurations to which the system converges. In the dissemination of undesirable contagions (such as rumors and misinformation), convergence to fixed points with a small number of affected nodes is a desirable goal. Motivated by such considerations, we formulate a novel optimization problem of finding a nontrivial fixed point of the system with the minimum number of affected nodes. We establish that, unless P = NP, there is no polynomial-time algorithm for approximating a solution to this problem to within the factor n^(1 - epsilon) for any constant epsilon > 0. To cope with this computational intractability, we identify several special cases for which the problem can be solved efficiently. Further, we introduce an integer linear program to address the problem for networks of reasonable sizes. For solving the problem on larger networks, we propose a general heuristic framework along with greedy selection methods.

A typical dilemma is: in order to provide complex intelligent services (e.g. smart city), we need inference results of multiple ML models, but the cost budget (e.g. GPU memory) is not enough to run all of them. In this work, we study underlying relationships among black-box ML models and propose a novel learning task: model linking. Model linking aims to bridge the knowledge of different black-box models by learning mappings (dubbed model links) between their output spaces. Based on model links, we developed a scheduling algorithm, named MLink. Through collaborative multi-model inference enabled by model links, MLink can improve the accuracy of obtained inference results under the cost budget. We evaluated MLink on a multi-modal dataset with seven different ML models and two real-world video analytics systems with six ML models and 3,264 hours of video. Experimental results show that our proposed model links can be effectively built among various black-box models.

Even though there are a number of fairness intervention methods in the literature, most of them require a complete training set as input. In practice, data can have missing values, and data missing patterns can depend on group attributes (e.g. gender or race). Simply applying off-the-shelf fair learning algorithms to an imputed dataset may lead to an unfair model. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze different sources of discrimination risks when training with an imputed dataset. Then, we propose an integrated approach based on decision trees that does not require a separate process of imputation and learning. Instead, we train a tree with missing incorporated as attribute (MIA), which does not require explicit imputation, and we optimize a fairness-regularized objective function. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing fairness intervention methods applied to an imputed dataset, through several experiments on real-world datasets."}

Therefore, it is vital to protect the intellectual property (IP) of the model builder and ensure the trustworthiness of the deployed models. Meanwhile, adversarial attacks on DNNs (e.g., backdoor and poisoning attacks) that seek to inject malicious behaviors have been investigated recently, demanding a means for verifying the integrity of the deployed model to protect the users. This paper presents a novel DNN authentication framework DeepAuth that embeds a unique and fragile signature to each protected DNN model. Our approach exploits sensitive key samples that are well crafted from the input space to latent space and then to logit space for producing signatures. After embedding, each model will respond distinctively to these key samples, which creates a model-unique signature as a strong tool for authentication and user identity. The signature embedding process is also designed to ensure the fragility of the signature, which can be used to detect malicious modifications such that an illegitimate user or an altered model should not have the intact signature. Extensive evaluations on various models over a wide range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DeepAuth."}

These criteria imply that adding the sensitive attribute as a feature removes the incentive for introduced variation under well-behaved loss functions. Additionally, taking a causal perspective, introduced path-specific effects shed light on the issue of when specific paths should be considered fair."}

However, it is not trivial to provide effective solutions directly due to two major challenges: 1) the structural dependency between pickup and delivery pairs require explicit modeling and representation. 2) the cooperation between different vehicles is highly related to the solution exploration and difficult to model. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning based framework to solve the cooperative PDP (MAPDP). First, we design a paired context embedding to well measure the dependency of different nodes considering their structural limits. Second, we utilize cooperative multi-agent decoders to leverage the decision dependence among different vehicle agents based on a special communication embedding.

Kleinberg and Oren (2014) introduced an elegant graph-theoretical model of inconsistent planning capturing the behavior of a present-biased agent accomplishing a set of actions. The essential measure of the system introduced by Kleinberg and Oren is the cost of irrationality -- the ratio of the total cost of the actions performed by the present-biased agent to the optimal cost. This measure is vital for a task designer to estimate the aftermaths of human behavior related to time-inconsistent planning, including procrastination and abandonment.   As we prove in this paper, the cost of irrationality is highly susceptible to the agent's choices when faced with a few possible actions of equal estimated costs. To address this issue, we propose a modification of Kleinberg-Oren's model of inconsistent planning. In our model, when an agent selects from several options of minimum prescribed cost, he uses a randomized procedure. We explore the algorithmic complexity of computing and estimating the cost of irrationality in the new model."}

The incorporation of more complex objectives such as robustness to disruptions further exacerbates the computational challenge. We present NICE (Neural network IP Coefficient Extraction), a novel technique that combines reinforcement learning and integer programming to tackle the problem of robust scheduling. More specifically, NICE uses reinforcement learning to approximately represent complex objectives in an integer programming formulation. We use NICE to determine assignments of pilots to a flight crew schedule so as to reduce the impact of disruptions. We compare NICE with (1) a baseline integer programming formulation that produces a feasible crew schedule, and (2) a robust integer programming formulation that explicitly tries to minimize the impact of disruptions. Our experiments show that, across a variety of scenarios, NICE produces schedules resulting in 33% to 48% fewer disruptions than the baseline formulation. Moreover, in more severely constrained scheduling scenarios in which the robust integer program fails to produce a schedule within 90 minutes, NICE is able to build robust schedules in less than 2 seconds on average."}

This output does not tend to be user-friendly, often consisting of sequences of parametrised actions or task networks. And these may not be practical for non-expert users who may find it easier to read natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose PlanVerb, a domain and planner-independent method for the verbalization of task plans. It is based on semantic tagging of actions and predicates. Our method can generate natural language descriptions of plans including causal explanations. The verbalized plans can be summarized by compressing the actions that act on the same parameters. We further extend the concept of verbalization space, previously applied to robot navigation, and apply it to planning to generate different kinds of plan descriptions for different user requirements. Our method can deal with PDDL and RDDL domains, provided that they are tagged accordingly. Our user survey evaluation shows that users can read our automatically generated plan descriptions and that the explanations help them answer questions about the plan."}

Decision-making techniques such as Automated planning have to take into account possible actions of adversary (or competing) agents. That said, the agent should know what the competitor will likely do and then generate its plan accordingly. In this paper we propose a novel approach for estimating strategies of the adversary (or the competitor), sampling its actions that might hinder agent's goals by interfering with the agent's actions. The estimated competitor strategies are used in plan generation such that agent's actions have to be applied prior to the ones of the competitor, whose estimated times dictate the deadlines. We empirically evaluate our approach leveraging sampling of competitor's actions by comparing it to the naive approach optimising the make-span (not taking the competing agent into account at all) and to Nash Equilibrium (mixed) strategies."}

Like graphical models, these probabilistic logic programs define a probability distribution over possible worlds, for which inference is computationally hard. We propose DeepStochLog, an alternative neural-symbolic framework based on stochastic definite clause grammars, a kind of stochastic logic program. More specifically, we introduce neural grammar rules into stochastic definite clause grammars to create a framework that can be trained end-to-end. We show that inference and learning in neural stochastic logic programming scale much better than for neural probabilistic logic programs. Furthermore, the experimental evaluation shows that DeepStochLog achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging neural-symbolic learning tasks."}

However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models either fail to obtain uncertainty estimation or need significant modification (e.g., formulating a proper Bayesian treatment) to obtain it. Most previous methods are not able to take an arbitrary model off the shelf and generate uncertainty estimation without retraining or redesigning it. To address this gap, we perform a systematic exploration into training-free uncertainty estimation for dense regression, an unrecognized yet important problem, and provide a theoretical construction justifying such estimations. We propose three simple and scalable methods to analyze the variance of outputs from a trained network under tolerable perturbations: infer-transformation, infer-noise, and infer-dropout. They operate solely during the inference, without the need to re-train, re-design, or fine-tune the models, as typically required by state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation methods. Surprisingly, even without involving such perturbations in training, our methods produce comparable or even better uncertainty estimation when compared to training-required state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/lumi9587/train-free-uncertainty."}

Recent supervised cross-modal hashing methods using multi-label networks utilize the semantics of multi-labels to enhance retrieval accuracy, where label hash codes are learned independently. However, all these methods assume that label annotations reliably reflect the relevance between their corresponding instances, which is not true in real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Bidirectional Reinforcement Guided Hashing for Effective Cross-Modal Retrieval (Bi-CMR), which exploits a bidirectional learning to relieve the negative impact of this assumption. Specifically, in the forward learning procedure, we highlight the representative labels and learn the reinforced multi-label hash codes by intra-modal semantic information, and further adjust similarity matrix. In the backward learning procedure, the reinforced multi-label hash codes and adjusted similarity matrix are used to guide the matching of instances. We construct two datasets with explicit relevance labels that reflect the semantic relevance of instance pairs based on two benchmark datasets. The Bi-CMR is evaluated by conducting extensive experiments over these two datasets. Experimental results prove the superiority of Bi-CMR over four state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness."}

The former typically fails in memory-restricted scenarios and the latter in time-restricted scenarios. Therefore, several algorithms were proposed to solve state-space tasks optimally using less memory than A* and less time than IDA*, such as A*+IDA*, a hybrid memory-restricted algorithm that combines A* and IDA*. In this paper, we present a hybrid memory-restricted algorithm that combines Partial Expansion A* (PEA*) and IDA*. This new algorithm has two phases, the same structure as the A*+IDA* algorithm. The first phase of PEA*+IDA* runs PEA* until it reaches a memory limit, and the second phase runs IDA* without duplicate detection on each node of PEA*'s Open. First, we present a model that shows how PEA*+IDA* can perform better than A*+IDA* although pure PEA* usually makes more expansions than pure A*. Later, we perform an experimental evaluation using three memory limits and show that, compared to A*+IDA* on classical planning domains, PEA*+IDA* has higher coverage and expands fewer nodes. Finally, we experimentally analyze both algorithms and show that having higher F-limits and better priority-queue composition given by PEA* have a considerable impact on the performance of the algorithms."}

The backdoor is planted in a hibernated mode to avoid being detected. Once deployed and fine-tuned on end-devices, the hibernated backdoor turns into the active state that can be exploited by the attacker. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first hibernated neural backdoor attack. It is achieved by maximizing the mutual information (MI) between the gradients of regular and malicious data on the model. We introduce a practical algorithm to achieve MI maximization to effectively plant the hibernated backdoor. To evade adaptive defenses, we further develop a targeted hibernated backdoor, which can only be activated by specific data samples and thus achieves a higher degree of stealthiness. We show the hibernated backdoor is robust and cannot be removed by existing backdoor removal schemes. It has been fully tested on four datasets with two neural network architectures, compared to five existing backdoor attacks, and evaluated using seven backdoor detection schemes. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the hibernated backdoor attack under various settings."}

In real-life, the feedbacks of such oracles are often noisy and available after some unknown delay that may depend on the computation time of the oracle. Additionally, if the exact evaluations are expensive but coarse approximations are available at a lower cost, the feedbacks can have multi-fidelity. In order to address this problem, we propose a generic extension of hierarchical optimistic tree search (HOO), called ProCrastinated Tree Search (PCTS), that flexibly accommodates a delay and noise-tolerant bandit algorithm. We provide a generic proof technique to quantify regret of PCTS under delayed, noisy, and multi-fidelity feedbacks. Specifically, we derive regret bounds of PCTS enabled with delayed-UCB1 (DUCB1) and delayed-UCB-V (DUCBV) algorithms. Given a horizon T, PCTS retains the regret bound of non-delayed HOO for expected delay of O(log T), and worsens by T^((1-α)/(d+2)) for expected delays of O(T^(1-α)) for α ∈ (0,1]. We experimentally validate on multiple synthetic functions and hyperparameter tuning problems that PCTS outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box optimization methods for feedbacks with different noise levels, delays, and fidelity."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2022", "Area": "AI", "Where": "AAAI", "Abbreviation": "DPCD", "Title": "Discrete Principal Coordinate Descent for Binary Variable Problems", "Abstract": "Binary optimization, a representative subclass of discrete optimization, plays an important role in mathematical optimization and has various applications in computer vision and machine learning. Generally speaking, binary optimization problems are NP-hard and difficult to solve due to the binary constraints, especially when the number of variables is very large. Existing methods often suffer from high computational costs or large accumulated quantization errors, or are only designed for specific tasks. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm, named Discrete Principal Coordinate Descent (DPCD), to find effective approximate solutions for general binary optimization problems. The proposed algorithm iteratively solves optimization problems related to the linear approximation of loss functions, which leads to updating the binary variables that most impact the value of the loss functions at each step. Our method supports a wide range of empirical objective functions with/without restrictions on the numbers of 1s and -1s in the binary variables. Furthermore, the theoretical convergence of our algorithm is proven, and the explicit convergence rates are derived for objective functions with Lipschitz continuous gradients, which are commonly adopted in practice. Extensive experiments on binary hashing tasks and large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over several state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2022", "Area": "AI", "Where": "AAAI", "Abbreviation": "Optimize What You Evaluate With", "Title": "Search Result Diversification Based on Metric Optimization", "Abstract": "Most of the existing methods for search result diversification (SRD) appeal to the greedy strategy for generating diversified results, which is formulated as a sequential process of selecting documents one-by-one, and the locally optimal choice is made at each round. Unfortunately, this strategy suffers from the following shortcomings: (1) Such a one-by-one selection process is rather time-consuming for both training and inference. (2) It works well on the premise that the preceding choices are optimal or close to the optimal solution. (3) The mismatch between the objective function used in training and the final evaluation measure used in testing has not been taken into account. We propose a novel framework through direct metric optimization for SRD (referred to as MO4SRD) based on the score-and-sort strategy. Specifically, we represent the diversity score of each document that determines its rank position based on a probability distribution. These distributions over scores naturally give rise to expectations over rank positions. Armed with this advantage, we can get the differentiable variants of the widely used diversity metrics. Thanks to this, we are able to directly optimize the evaluation measure used in testing. Moreover, we have devised a novel probabilistic neural scoring function. It jointly scores candidate documents by taking into account both cross-document interaction and permutation equivariance, which makes it possible to generate a diversified ranking via a simple sorting. The experimental results on benchmark collections show that the proposed method achieves significantly improved performance over the state-of-the-art results."}

A*+BFHS is based on A* and breadth-first heuristic search (BFHS). A*+BFHS combines advantages from both algorithms, namely A*'s node ordering, BFHS's memory savings, and both algorithms' duplicate detection. On easy problems, A*+BFHS behaves the same as A*. On hard problems, it is slower than A* but saves a large amount of memory. Compared to BFIDA*, A*+BFHS reduces the search time and/or memory requirement by several times on a variety of planning domains."}

For solving instances with different scales, this paper develops an efficient local search algorithm named NukCP for the MkCP which mainly includes two novel ideas. First, we propose a dynamic reduction strategy, which makes a good balance between the time efficiency and the precision effectiveness of the upper bound calculation. Second, a stratified threshold configuration checking strategy is designed by giving different priorities for the neighborhood in the different levels. Experiments on a broad range of different scale instances show that NukCP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MkCP algorithms on most instances."}

While generally reliable, state-of-the-art MIP solvers base many crucial decisions on hand-crafted heuristics, largely ignoring common patterns within a given instance distribution of the problem of interest. Here, we propose MIP-GNN, a general framework for enhancing such solvers with data-driven insights. By encoding the variable-constraint interactions of a given mixed-integer linear program (MILP) as a bipartite graph, we leverage state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures to predict variable biases, i.e., component-wise averages of (near) optimal solutions, indicating how likely a variable will be set to 0 or 1 in (near) optimal solutions of binary MILPs. In turn, the predicted biases stemming from a single, once-trained model are used to guide the solver, replacing heuristic components. We integrate MIP-GNN into a state-of-the-art MIP solver, applying it to tasks such as node selection and warm-starting, showing significant improvements compared to the default setting of the solver on two classes of challenging binary MILPs.

It is often necessary to guide the subset selection to achieve certain desiderata, which includes focusing or targeting certain data points, while avoiding others. Examples of such problems include: i)targeted learning, where the goal is to find subsets with rare classes or rare attributes on which the model is under performing, and ii)guided summarization, where data (e.g., image collection, text, document or video) is summarized for quicker human consumption with specific additional user intent. Motivated by such applications, we present PRISM, a rich class of PaRameterIzed Submodular information Measures. Through novel functions and their parameterizations, PRISM offers a variety of modeling capabilities that enable a trade-off between desired qualities of a subset like diversity or representation and similarity/dissimilarity with a set of data points. We demonstrate how PRISM can be applied to the two real-world problems mentioned above, which require guided subset selection. In doing so, we show that PRISM interestingly generalizes some past work, therein reinforcing its broad utility. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of PRISM over the state-of-the-art in targeted learning and in guided image-collection summarization.
