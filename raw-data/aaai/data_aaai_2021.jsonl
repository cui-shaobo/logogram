In this paper, we propose DeepTrader, a deep RL method to optimize the investment policy. In particular, to tackle the risk-return balancing problem, our model embeds macro market conditions as an indicator to dynamically adjust the proportion between long and short funds, to lower the risk of market fluctuations, with the negative maximum drawdown as the reward function. Additionally, the model involves a unit to evaluate individual assets, which learns dynamic patterns from historical data with the price rising rate as the reward function. Both temporal and spatial dependencies between assets are captured hierarchically by a specific type of graph structure. Particularly, we find that the estimated causal structure best captures the interrelationships between assets, compared to industry classification and correlation. The two units are complementary and integrated to generate a suitable portfolio which fits the market trend well and strikes a balance between return and risk effectively. Experiments on three well-known stock indexes demonstrate the superiority of DeepTrader in terms of risk-gain criteria."}

This is not a trivial problem as it involves searching for a complex mathematical relationship over a large set of explanatory variables and operators that can be combined in an infinite number of ways.  Inspired by the incredible success of deep learning in computer vision, we tackle this problem by adapting various successful network architectures into the symbolic law discovery pipeline. The novelty of our approach is in (1) encoding the input data as an image with super-resolution, (2) developing an appropriate deep network pipeline, and (3) predicting the importance of each mathematical operator from the relationship image. This allows us to prior the exponentially large search with the predicted importance of the symbolic operators, which can significantly accelerate the discovery process.  We apply our model to a variety of plausible relationships---both simulated and from physics and mathematics domains---involving different dimensions and constituents. We show that our model is able to identify the underlying operators from data, achieving a high accuracy and AUC (91% and 0.96 on average resp.) for systems with as many as ten independent variables. Our method significantly outperforms the current state of the art in terms of data fitting (R^2), discovery rate (recovering the true relationship), and succinctness (output formula complexity). The discovered equations can be seen as first drafts of scientific laws that can be helpful to the scientists for (1) hypothesis building, and (2) understanding the complex underlying structure of the studied phenomena. Our approach holds a real promise to help speed up the rate of scientific discovery."}

Existing methods commonly embed the records of a single patient into a representation for medical tasks. Such methods learn inadequate representations and lead to inferior performance, especially when the patient’s data is sparse or low-quality. Aiming at the above problem, we propose GRASP, a generic framework for healthcare models. For a given patient, GRASP first finds patients in the dataset who have similar conditions and similar results (i.e., the similar patients), and then enhances the representation learning and prognosis of the given patient by leveraging knowledge extracted from these similar patients. GRASP defines similarities with different meanings between patients for different clinical tasks, and finds similar patients with useful information accordingly, and then learns cohort representation to extract valuable knowledge contained in the similar patients. The cohort information is fused with the current patient’s representation to conduct final clinical tasks. Experimental evaluations on two real-world datasets show that GRASP can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art models with consistent performance improvements. Besides, under the guidance of medical experts, we verified the findings extracted by GRASP, and the findings are consistent with the existing medical knowledge, indicating that GRASP can generate useful insights for relevant predictions."}

However, most RL-based advertising algorithms focus on optimizing ads' revenue while ignoring the possible negative influence of ads on user experience of recommended items (products, articles and videos). Developing an optimal advertising algorithm in recommendations faces immense challenges because interpolating ads improperly or too frequently may decrease user experience, while interpolating fewer ads will reduce the advertising revenue. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel advertising strategy for the rec/ads trade-off. To be specific, we develop an RL-based framework that can continuously update its advertising strategies and maximize reward in the long run. Given a recommendation list, we design a novel Deep Q-network architecture that can determine three internally related tasks jointly, i.e., (i) whether to interpolate an ad or not in the recommendation list, and if yes, (ii) the optimal ad and (iii) the optimal location to interpolate. The experimental results based on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."}

This metric is particularly important in tandem service systems, where the end-to-end service is provided through a chain of services. Service-rate control is a common mechanism for providing QoS guarantees in service systems. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) service-rate controller that provides probabilistic upper-bounds on the end-to-end delay of the system, while preventing the overuse of service resources. In order to have a general framework, we use queueing theory to model the service systems. However, we adopt an RL-based approach to avoid the limitations of queueing-theoretic methods. In particular, we use Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to learn the service rates (action) as a function of the queue lengths (state) in tandem service systems. In contrast to existing RL-based methods that quantify their performance by the achieved overall reward, which could be hard to interpret or even misleading, our proposed controller provides explicit probabilistic guarantees on the end-to-end delay of the system. The evaluations are presented for a tandem queueing system with non-exponential inter-arrival and service times, the results of which validate our controller's capability in meeting QoS constraints."}

Many of the statistical approaches developed for CRA are limited by strong assumptions about the underlying stochastic processes. To overcome these issues and to handle censoring, machine learning approaches for CRA have designed specialized cost functions. However, these approaches are not generalizable, and are computationally expensive. This paper formulates CRA as a cause-specific regression problem and proposes DeepPseudo models, which use simple and effective feed-forward deep neural networks, to predict the cumulative incidence function (CIF) using Aalen-Johansen estimator-based pseudo values. DeepPseudo models capture the time-varying covariate effect on CIF while handling the censored observations. We show how DeepPseudo models can address co-variate dependent censoring by using modified pseudo values. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed models obtain promising and statistically significant results compared to the state-of-the-art CRA approaches. Furthermore, we show that explainable methods such as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation can be used to interpret the predictions of our DeepPseudo models."}

While both signals are used for heart rate monitoring, from a medical perspective, ECG is more useful as it carries additional cardiac information. Despite many attempts toward incorporating ECG sensing in smartwatches or similar wearable devices for continuous and reliable cardiac monitoring, PPG sensors are the main feasible sensing solution available. In order to tackle this problem, we propose CardioGAN, an adversarial model which takes PPG as input and generates ECG as output. The proposed network utilizes an attention-based generator to learn local salient features, as well as dual discriminators to preserve the integrity of generated data in both time and frequency domains. Our experiments show that the ECG generated by CardioGAN provides more reliable heart rate measurements compared to the original input PPG, reducing the error from 9.74 beats per minute (measured from the PPG) to 2.89 (measured from the generated ECG)."}

Despite advances in deep learning that have made significant progress in the complex and highly stochastic stock prediction problem, modern solutions face two significant limitations.  They do not directly optimize the target of investment in terms of profit, and treat each stock as independent from the others, ignoring the rich signals between related stocks' temporal price movements. Building on these limitations, we reformulate stock prediction as a learning to rank problem and propose STHAN-SR, a neural hypergraph architecture for stock selection. The key novelty of our work is the proposal of modeling the complex relations between stocks through a hypergraph and a temporal Hawkes attention mechanism to tailor a new spatiotemporal attention hypergraph network architecture to rank stocks based on profit by jointly modeling stock interdependence and the temporal evolution of their prices. Through experiments on three markets spanning over six years of data, we show that STHAN-SR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art neural stock forecasting methods. We validate our design choices through ablative and exploratory analyses over STHAN-SR's spatial and temporal components and demonstrate its practical applicability."}

Human painter artistry emphasizes important features of the target image rather than simply reproducing it.  Using adversarial or L2 losses in the RL painting models, although its final output is generally a work of finesse, produces a stroke sequence that is vastly different from that which a human would produce since the model does not have knowledge about the abstract features in the target image.  In order to increase the human-like planning of the model without the use of expensive human data, we introduce a new loss function for use with the model's reward function: Content Masked Loss. In the context of robot painting, Content Masked Loss employs an object detection model to extract features which are used to assign higher weight to regions of the canvas that a human would find important for recognizing content. The results, based on 332 human evaluators, show that the digital paintings produced by our Content Masked model show detectable subject matter earlier in the stroke sequence than existing methods without compromising on the quality of the final painting. Our code is available at https://github.com/pschaldenbrand/ContentMaskedLoss."}

In SDM, the occurrence pattern of a species on a landscape is predicted by environmental features based on observations at a set of locations. At first, SDM may appear to be a binary classification problem, and one might be inclined to employ classic tools (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines, neural networks) to tackle it. However, wildlife surveys introduce structured noise (especially under-counting) in the species observations. If unaccounted for, these observation errors systematically bias SDMs. To address the unique challenges of SDM, this paper proposes a framework called StatEcoNet. Specifically, this work employs a graphical generative model in statistical ecology to serve as the skeleton of the proposed computational framework and carefully integrates neural networks under the framework. The advantages of StatEcoNet over related approaches are demonstrated on simulated datasets as well as bird species data. Since SDMs are critical tools for ecological science and natural resource management, StatEcoNet may offer boosted computational and analytical powers to a wide range of applications that have significant social impacts, e.g., the study and conservation of threatened species."}

Recently, the retrosynthesis task has been solved automatically without human expertise using powerful deep learning models. Recent deep models are primarily based on seq2seq or graph neural networks depending on the function of molecular representation, sequence, or graph. Current state-of-the-art models represent a molecule as a graph, but they require joint training with auxiliary prediction tasks, such as the most probable reaction template or reaction center prediction. Furthermore, they require additional labels by experienced chemists, thereby incurring additional cost. Herein, we propose a novel template-free model, i.e., Graph Truncated Attention (GTA), which leverages both sequence and graph representations by inserting graphical information into a seq2seq model. The proposed GTA model masks the self-attention layer using the adjacency matrix of product molecule in the encoder and applies a new loss using atom mapping acquired from an automated algorithm to the cross-attention layer in the decoder. Our model achieves new state-of-the-art records, i.e., exact match top-1 and top-10 accuracies of 51.1% and 81.6% on the USPTO-50k benchmark dataset, respectively, and 46.0% and 70.0% on the USPTO-full dataset, respectively, both without any reaction class information. The GTA model surpasses prior graph-based template-free models by 2% and 7% in terms of the top-1 and top-10 accuracies on the USPTO-50k dataset, respectively, and by over 6% for both the top-1 and top-10 accuracies on the USPTO-full dataset."}

Traditional TSE approaches mainly bifurcate into two categories: model-driven and data-driven, and each of them has shortcomings. To mitigate these limitations, hybrid TSE methods, which combine both model-driven and data-driven, are becoming a promising solution. This paper introduces a hybrid framework, physics-informed deep learning (PIDL), to combine second-order traffic flow models and neural networks to solve the TSE problem. PIDL can encode traffic flow models into deep neural networks to regularize the learning process to achieve improved data efficiency and estimation accuracy. We focus on highway TSE with observed data from loop detectors and probe vehicles, using both density and average velocity as the traffic variables. With numerical examples, we show the use of PIDL to solve a popular second-order traffic flow model, i.e., a Greenshields-based Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model, and discover the model parameters. We then evaluate the PIDL-based TSE method using the Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed PIDL-based approach to outperform advanced baseline methods in terms of data efficiency and estimation accuracy."}

Therefore, LOB data is extremely valuable for modelling market dynamics. However, LOB data is not freely accessible, which poses a challenge to market participants and researchers wishing to exploit this information. Fortunately, trades and quotes (TAQ) data - orders arriving at the top of the LOB, and trades executing in the market - are more readily available. In this paper, we present the LOB recreation model, a first attempt from a deep learning perspective to recreate the top five price levels of the LOB for small-tick stocks using only TAQ data. Volumes of orders sitting deep in the LOB are predicted by combining outputs from: (1) a history compiler that uses a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) module to selectively compile prediction relevant quote history; (2) a market events simulator, which uses an Ordinary Differential Equation Recurrent Neural Network (ODE-RNN) to simulate the accumulation of net order arrivals; and (3) a weighting scheme to adaptively combine the predictions generated by (1) and (2). By the paradigm of transfer learning, the core encoder trained on one stock can be fine-tuned to enable application to other financial assets of the same class with much lower demand on additional data. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two real world intraday LOB datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently recreate the LOB with high accuracy using only TAQ data as input."}

This has motivated numerous studies on automating fake news detection. Most studies explore supervised training models with different modalities (e.g., text, images, and propagation networks) of news records to identify fake news. However, the performance of such techniques generally drops if news records are coming from different domains (e.g., politics, entertainment), especially for domains that are unseen or rarely-seen during training. As motivation, we empirically show that news records from different domains have significantly different word usage and propagation patterns. Furthermore, due to the sheer volume of unlabelled news records, it is challenging to select news records for manual labelling so that the domain-coverage of the labelled dataset is maximised. Hence, this work: (1) proposes a novel framework that jointly preserves domain-specific and cross-domain knowledge in news records to detect fake news from different domains; and (2) introduces an unsupervised technique to select a set of unlabelled informative news records for manual labelling, which can be ultimately used to train a fake news detection model that performs well for many domains while minimizing the labelling cost. Our experiments show that the integration of the proposed fake news model and the selective annotation approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for cross-domain news datasets, while yielding notable improvements for rarely-appearing domains in news datasets."}

However, it provides limited 2D information compared with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), another dental imaging method that generates a 3D picture of the oral cavity but with more radiation dose and a higher price. Consequently, it is of great interest to reconstruct the 3D structure from a 2D X-ray image, which can greatly explore the application of X-ray imaging in dental surgeries. In this paper, we propose a framework, named Oral-3D, to reconstruct the 3D oral cavity from a single PX image and prior information of the dental arch. Specifically, we first train a generative model to learn the cross-dimension transformation from 2D to 3D. Then we restore the shape of the oral cavity with a deformation module with the dental arch curve, which can be obtained simply by taking a photo of the patient's mouth. To be noted, Oral-3D can restore both the density of bony tissues and the curved mandible surface. Experimental results show that Oral-3D can efficiently and effectively reconstruct the 3D oral structure and show critical information in clinical applications, e.g., tooth pulling and dental implants. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore this domain transformation problem between these two imaging methods."}

Besides displaying items to optimize for a single objective (i.e., relevance), ranking items needs to satisfy some other business requirements in practice. Recently, traffic shaping was introduced to incorporate multiple objectives in a constrained optimization framework. However, many practical business requirements can not explicitly represented by linear constraints as in the existing work, and this may limit the scalablity of their framework. This paper presents a unified framework from the aspect of multi-objective welfare maximization where we regard all business requirements as objectives to optimize. Our framework can naturally incorporate a wide range of application-driven requirements. In addition to formulating the problem, we design an online traffic splitting algorithm that allows us to flexibly adjust the priorities of different objectives, and it has rigorous theoretical guarantees over the adversarial scenario. We also run experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to validate our algorithms."}

It comprises two modules: i) an optional and interchangeable temporal segmentation, which divides the handwriting into short-time segments consisting of individual or multiple concatenated strokes; and ii) the on-line synthesis of those short-time handwriting segments, which is based on a sequence-to-sequence Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The main advantages of the proposed approach are that the synthesis is carried out in short-time segments (that can run from a character fraction to full characters) and that the VAE can be trained on a configurable handwriting dataset. These two properties give a lot of flexibility to our synthesiser, e.g., as shown in our experiments, DeepWriteSYN can generate realistic handwriting variations of a given handwritten structure corresponding to the natural variation within a given population or a given subject. These two cases are developed experimentally for individual digits and handwriting signatures, respectively, achieving in both cases remarkable results.  Also, we provide experimental results for the task of on-line signature verification showing the high potential of DeepWriteSYN to improve significantly one-shot learning scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first synthesis approach capable of generating realistic on-line handwriting in the short term (including handwritten signatures) via deep learning. This can be very useful as a module toward long-term realistic handwriting generation either completely synthetic or as natural variation of given handwriting samples."}

To achieve the accurate PSSP, the general and vital feature engineering is to use multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) extraction. However, when only low-quality PSSM can be obtained due to poor sequence homology, previous PSSP accuracy (merely around 65%) is far from practical usage for subsequent tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel PSSM-Distil framework for PSSP on low-quality PSSM, which not only enhances the PSSM feature at a lower level but also aligns the feature distribution at a higher level. In practice, the PSSM-Distil first exploits the proteins with high-quality PSSM to achieve a teacher network for PSSP in a full-supervised way. Under the guidance of the teacher network, the low-quality PSSM and corresponding student network with low discriminating capacity are effectively resolved by feature enhancement through EnhanceNet and distribution alignment through knowledge distillation with contrastive learning. Further, our PSSM-Distil supports the input from a pre-trained protein sequence language BERT model to provide auxiliary information, which is designed to address the extremely low-quality PSSM cases, i.e., no homologous sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed PSSM-Distil outperforms state-of-the-art models on PSSP by 6% on average and nearly 8% in extremely low-quality cases on public benchmarks, BC40 and CB513."}

Existing methods are impractical since they usually assume each reallocation can be finished immediately and thus ignoring the price slippage as part of the trading cost. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical reinforced stock trading system for portfolio management (HRPM). Concretely, we decompose the trading process into a hierarchy of portfolio management over trade execution and train the corresponding policies. The high-level policy gives portfolio weights at a lower frequency to maximize the long-term profit and invokes the low-level policy to sell or buy the corresponding shares within a short time window at a higher frequency to minimize the trading cost. We train two levels of policies via a pre-training scheme and an iterative training scheme for data efficiency. Extensive experimental results in the U.S. market and the China market demonstrate that HRPM achieves significant improvement against many state-of-the-art approaches."}

In this paper, we propose an automatic character face creation method that predicts both facial shape and texture from a single portrait, and it can be integrated into most existing 3D games. Although 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM) based methods can restore accurate 3D faces from single images, the topology of 3DMM mesh is different from the meshes used in most games. To acquire fidelity texture, existing methods require a large amount of face texture data for training, while building such datasets is time-consuming and laborious. Besides, such a dataset collected under laboratory conditions may not generalized well to in-the-wild situations. To tackle these problems, we propose 1) a low-cost facial texture acquisition method, 2) a shape transfer algorithm that can transform the shape of a 3DMM mesh to games, and 3) a new pipeline for training 3D game face reconstruction networks. The proposed method not only can produce detailed and vivid game characters similar to the input portrait, but can also eliminate the influence of lighting and occlusions.

Hence, radiograph analysis naturally requires physicians to relate their prior knowledge about 3D human anatomy to 2D radiographs. Synthesizing novel radiographic views in a small range can assist physicians in interpreting anatomy more reliably; however, radiograph view synthesis is heavily ill-posed, lacking in paired data, and lacking in differentiable operations to leverage learning-based approaches. To address these problems, we use Computed Tomography (CT) for radiograph simulation and design a differentiable projection algorithm, which enables us to achieve geometrically consistent transformations between the radiography and CT domains. Our method, XraySyn, can synthesize novel views on real radiographs through a combination of realistic simulation and finetuning on real radiographs.

It is estimated that there are nearly 7,000 rare disease affecting 30 million patients in the U. S. alone. Most of the patients suffering from rare diseases experience multiple misdiagnoses and may never be diagnosed correctly. This is largely driven by the low prevalence of the disease that results in a lack of awareness among healthcare providers. There have been efforts from machine learning researchers to develop predictive models to help diagnose patients using healthcare datasets such as electronic health records and administrative claims. Most recently, transformer models have been applied to predict diseases BEHRT, G-BERT and Med-BERT. However, these have been developed specifically for electronic health records (EHR) and have not been designed to address rare disease challenges such as class imbalance, partial longitudinal data capture, and noisy labels. As a result, they deliver poor performance in predicting rare diseases compared with baselines. Besides, EHR datasets are generally confined to the hospital systems using them and do not capture a wider sample of patients thus limiting the availability of sufficient rare dis-ease patients in the dataset. To address these challenges, we introduced an extension of the BERT model tailored for rare disease diagnosis called RareBERT which has been trained on administrative claims datasets. RareBERT extends Med-BERT by including context embedding and temporal reference embedding. Moreover, we introduced a novel adaptive loss function to handle the class imbal-ance. In this paper, we show our experiments on diagnosing X-Linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH), a genetic rare disease. While RareBERT performs significantly better than the baseline models (79.9% AUPRC versus 30% AUPRC for Med-BERT), owing to the transformer architecture, it also shows its robustness in partial longitudinal data capture caused by poor capture of claims with a drop in performance of only 1.35% AUPRC, compared with 12% for Med-BERT and 33.0% for LSTM and 67.4% for boosting trees based baseline."}

Existing generative models and reinforcement learning approaches made initial success, but still face difficulties in simultaneously optimizing multiple drug properties. To address such challenges, we propose the MultI-constraint MOlecule SAmpling (MIMOSA) approach, a sampling framework to use input molecule as an initial guess and sample molecules from the target distribution. MIMOSA first pretrains two property agnostic graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecule topology and substructure-type prediction, where a substructure can be either atom or single ring. For each iteration, MIMOSA uses the GNNs’ prediction and employs three basic substructure operations (add, replace, delete) to generate new molecules and associated weights. The weights can encode multiple constraints including similarity and drug property constraints, upon which we select promising molecules for next iteration. MIMOSA enables flexible encoding of multiple property- and similarity-constraints and can efficiently generate new molecules that satisfy various property constraints and achieved up to 49.1% relative improvement over the best baseline in terms of success rate."}

The behavior of a physical system is often described via ordinary differential equations (ODE), referred to as the dynamics. In the standard case, the dynamics are derived from purely physical considerations. By contrast, in this work we study how the dynamics can be learned by a generative adversarial network which combines both physical and data considerations. As a use case, we focus on the dynamics of the heart signal electrocardiogram (ECG). We begin by introducing a new GAN framework, dubbed ODE-GAN, in which the generator learns the dynamics of a physical system in the form of an ordinary differential equation. Specifically, the generator network receives as input a value at a specific time step, and produces the derivative of the system at that time step. Thus, the ODE-GAN learns purely data-driven dynamics. We then show how to incorporate physical considerations into ODE-GAN. We achieve this through the introduction of an additional input to the ODE-GAN generator: physical parameters, which partially characterize the signal of interest. As we focus on ECG signals, we refer to this new framework as ECG-ODE-GAN. We perform an empirical evaluation and show that generating ECG heartbeats from our learned dynamics improves ECG heartbeat classification."}

Skillful SSF would have immense societal value in such areas as agricultural productivity, water resource management, and emergency planning for extreme weather events. However, SSF is considered more challenging than either weather prediction or even seasonal prediction, and is still a largely understudied problem. In this paper, we carefully investigate 10 Machine Learning (ML) approaches to sub-seasonal temperature forecasting over the contiguous U.S. on the SSF dataset we collect, including a variety of climate variables from the atmosphere, ocean, and land. Because of the complicated atmosphere-land-ocean couplings and the limited amount of good quality observational data, SSF imposes a great challenge for ML despite the recent advances in various domains. Our results indicate that suitable ML models, e.g., XGBoost, to some extent, capture the predictability on sub-seasonal time scales and can outperform the climatological baselines, while Deep Learning (DL) models barely manage to match the best results with carefully designed architecture. Besides, our analysis and exploration provide insights on important aspects to improve the quality of sub-seasonal forecasts, e.g., feature representation and model architecture. The SSF dataset and code are released with this paper for use by the broader research community."}

Such a vocabulary usually involves tokens of various types. For example, to describe a musical note, one needs separate tokens to indicate the note’s pitch, duration, velocity (dynamics), and placement (onset time) along the time grid. While different types of tokens may possess different properties, existing models usually treat them equally, in the same way as modeling words in natural languages. In this paper, we present a conceptually different approach that explicitly takes into account the type of the tokens, such as note types and metric types. And, we propose a new Transformer decoder architecture that uses different feed-forward heads to model tokens of different types. With an expansion-compression trick, we convert a piece of music to a sequence of compound words by grouping neighboring tokens, greatly reducing the length of the token sequences. We show that the resulting model can be viewed as a learner over dynamic directed hypergraphs. And, we employ it to learn to compose expressive Pop piano music of full-song length (involving up to 10K individual tokens per song), both conditionally and unconditionally. Our experiment shows that, compared to state-of-the-art models, the proposed model converges 5 to 10 times faster at training (i.e., within a day on a single GPU with 11 GB memory), and with comparable quality in the generated music"}

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received widespread attention and lead to state-of-the-art performance in learning node representations. However, most GNNs only work in unsigned networks, where only positive links exist. It is not trivial to transfer these models to signed directed networks, which are widely observed in the real world yet less studied. In this paper, we first review two fundamental sociological theories (i.e., status theory and balance theory) and conduct empirical studies on real-world datasets to analyze the social mechanism in signed directed networks. Guided by related socio- logical theories, we propose a novel Signed Directed Graph Neural Networks model named SDGNN to learn node embeddings for signed directed networks. The proposed model simultaneously reconstructs link signs, link directions, and signed directed triangles. We validate our model’s effectiveness on five real-world datasets, which are commonly used as the benchmark for signed network embeddings. Experiments demonstrate the proposed model outperforms existing models, including feature-based methods, network embedding methods, and several GNN methods."}

When more simulations are executed, MCTS can achieve higher performance but also requires enormous amounts of CPU and GPU resources. However, not all states require a long searching time to identify the best action that the agent can find. For example, in 19x19 Go and NoGo, we found that for more than half of the states, the best action predicted by DNN remains unchanged even after searching 2 minutes. This implies that a significant amount of resources can be saved if we are able to stop the searching earlier when we are confident with the current searching result. In this paper, we propose to achieve this goal by predicting the uncertainty of the current searching status and use the result to decide whether we should stop searching. With our algorithm, called Dynamic Simulation MCTS (DS-MCTS), we can speed up a NoGo agent trained by AlphaZero 2.5 times faster while maintaining a similar winning rate, which is critical for training and conducting experiments. Also, under the same average simulation count, our method can achieve a 61% winning rate against the original program."}

The method comprises two steps. First, the method computes a low-dimensional embedding of the high-dimensional dynamical-system state using deep convolutional autoencoders. This defines a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold on which the state is subsequently enforced to evolve. Second, the method defines a latent-dynamics model that associates with the solution to a constrained optimization problem. Here, the objective function is defined as the sum of squares of conservation-law violations over control volumes within a finite-volume discretization of the problem; nonlinear equality constraints explicitly enforce conservation over prescribed subdomains of the problem. Under modest conditions, the resulting dynamics model guarantees that the time-evolution of the latent state exactly satisfies conservation laws over the prescribed subdomains."}

We are interested in machine perception of interactive media (such as games, apps, and complex web applications) where interactive audience choices have long-term implications for the audience experience. While there is ample research on AI methods for the task of playing games (often just one game at a time), this work is difficult to apply to new and in-development games or to use for non-playing tasks such as similarity-based retrieval or authoring assistance. In response, we contribute a corpus of 755 games and structured metadata, spread across several platforms (Twine, Bitsy, Construct, and Godot), with full source and assets available and appropriately licensed for use and redistribution in research. Because these games were sourced from student projects in an undergraduate game development program, they reference timely themes in their content and represent a variety of levels of design polish rather than only representing past commercial successes. This corpus could accelerate research in understanding interactive media while anchoring that work in freshly-developed games intended as legitimate human experiences (rather than lab-created AI testbeds). We validate the utility of this corpus by setting up the novel task of predicting tags relevant to the player experience from the game source code, showing that representations that better exploit the structure of the media outperform a text-only baseline."}

While graphs may be better than trees at capturing code semantics, constructing the graphs from code inputs through the semantic analysis of multiple viewpoints can lead to inaccurate noises for a specific software engineering task. Compared to graphs, syntax trees are more precisely defined on the grammar and easier to parse; unfortunately, previous tree-based learning techniques have not been able to learn semantic information from trees to achieve better accuracy than graph-based techniques. We have proposed a new learning technique, named TreeCaps, by fusing together capsule networks with tree-based convolutional neural networks to achieve a learning accuracy higher than some existing graph-based techniques while it is based only on trees. TreeCaps introduces novel variable-to-static routing algorithms into the capsule networks to compensate for the loss of previous routing algorithms. Aside from accuracy, we also find that TreeCaps is the most robust to withstand those semantic-preserving program transformations that change code syntax without modifying the semantics. Evaluated on a large number of Java and C/C++ programs, TreeCaps models outperform prior deep learning models of program source code, in terms of both accuracy and robustness for program comprehension tasks such as code functionality classification and function name prediction.

The IHC staining slide is usually digitized into the whole-slide image (WSI) with gigapixels for quantitative image analysis. To perform a whole image prediction (e.g., IHC scoring, survival prediction, and cancer grading) from this kind of high-dimensional image, algorithms are often developed based on multi-instance learning (MIL) framework. However, the multi-scale information of WSI and the associations among instances are not well explored in existing MIL based studies. Inspired by the fact that pathologists jointly analyze visual fields at multiple powers of objective for diagnostic predictions, we propose a Pathologist-Tree Network (PTree-Net) to sparsely model the WSI efficiently in multi-scale manner. Specifically, we propose a Focal-Aware Module (FAM) that can approximately estimate diagnosis-related regions with an extractor trained using the thumbnail of WSI. With the initial diagnosis-related regions, we hierarchically model the multi-scale patches in a tree structure, where both the global and local information can be captured. To explore this tree structure in an end-to-end network, we propose a patch Relevance-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) to explicitly model the correlations of adjacent parent-child nodes, accompanied by patch relevance to exploit the implicit contextual information among distant nodes. In addition, tree-based self-supervision is devised to improve representation learning and suppress irrelevant instances adaptively. Extensive experiments are performed on a large-scale IHC HER2 dataset. The ablation study confirms the effectiveness of our design, and our approach outperforms state-of-the-art by a large margin."}

There has been an increasing demand for fake news detection due to its detrimental effects. Generally, news content is condensed and full of knowledge entities. However, existing methods usually focus on the textual contents and social context, and ignore the knowledge-level relationships among news entities. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge-aware Attention Network (KAN) that incorporates external knowledge from knowledge graph for fake news detection. Firstly, we identify entity mentions in news contents and align them with the entities in knowledge graph. Then, the entities and their contexts are used as external knowledge to provide complementary information. Finally, we design News towards Entities (N-E) attention and News towards Entities and Entity Contexts (N-E^2C) attention to measure the importances of knowledge. Thus, our proposed model can incorporate both semantic-level and knowledge-level representations of news to detect fake news. Experimental results on three public datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and also validate the effectiveness of knowledge attention."}

However, finding ride matches in real-time at urban scale is a very difficult combinatorial optimization problem and mostly heuristic approaches are applied. In this work, we introduce a principled approach to this combinatorial problem. Our approach proceeds by constructing suitable representations for rides and driver routes capturing their essential spatio-temporal aspects in an appropriate vector space, and defining a similarity metric in this space that expresses matching utility. This then lets us mathematically model the problem of finding ride matches as that of Near Neighbor Search (NNS). Exploiting this modeling, we devise a novel spatio-temporal search algorithm for finding ride matches based on the theory of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Apart from being highly efficient, our algorithm enjoys several practically useful properties and extension possibilities. Experiments with large real-world datasets show that our algorithm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic methods thereby proving its practical applicability."}

For the VR contents inducing the similar VR sickness level, the physical symptoms can vary depending on the characteristics of the contents. Most of existing VRSA methods focused on assessing the overall VR sickness score. To make better understanding of VR sickness, it is required to predict and provide the level of major symptoms of VR sickness rather than overall degree of VR sickness. In this paper, we predict the degrees of main physical symptoms affecting the overall degree of VR sickness, which are disorientation, nausea, and oculomotor. In addition, we introduce a new large-scale dataset for VRSA including 360 videos with various frame rates, physiological signals, and subjective scores. On VRSA benchmark and our newly collected dataset, our approach shows a potential to not only achieve the highest correlation with subjective scores, but also to better understand which symptoms are the main causes of VR sickness."}

However, no prior dataset or benchmark has systematically evaluated physically grounded perception of complex social interactions that go beyond short actions, such as high-fiving, or simple group activities, such as gathering. In this work, we create a dataset of physically-grounded abstract social events, PHASE, that resemble a wide range of real-life social interactions by including social concepts such as helping another agent. PHASE consists of 2D animations of pairs of agents moving in a continuous space generated procedurally using a physics engine and a hierarchical planner. Agents have a limited field of view, and can interact with multiple objects, in an environment that has multiple landmarks and obstacles. Using PHASE, we design a social recognition task and a social prediction task. PHASE is validated with human experiments demonstrating that humans perceive rich interactions in the social events, and that the simulated agents behave similarly to humans. As a baseline model, we introduce a Bayesian inverse planning approach, SIMPLE (SIMulation, Planning and Local Estimation), which outperforms state-of-the-art feed-forward neural networks. We hope that PHASE can serve as a difficult new challenge for developing new models that can recognize complex social interactions."}

However, it is still a challenging task to execute 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) targeting for real-time performance, besides high inference accuracy. The reason is more complex model structure and higher model dimensionality overwhelm the available computation/storage resources on mobile devices. A natural way may be turning to deep learning weight pruning techniques. However, the direct generalization of existing 2D CNN weight pruning methods to 3D CNNs is not ideal for fully exploiting mobile parallelism while achieving high inference accuracy.  This paper proposes RT3D, a model compression and mobile acceleration framework for 3D CNNs, seamlessly integrating neural network weight pruning and compiler code generation techniques. We propose and investigate two structured sparsity schemes i.e., the vanilla structured sparsity and kernel group structured (KGS) sparsity that are mobile acceleration friendly. The vanilla sparsity removes whole kernel groups, while KGS sparsity is a more fine-grained structured sparsity that enjoys higher flexibility while exploiting full on-device parallelism. We propose a reweighted regularization pruning algorithm to achieve the proposed sparsity schemes. The inference time speedup due to sparsity is approaching the pruning rate of the whole model FLOPs (floating point operations). RT3D demonstrates up to 29.1x speedup in end-to-end inference time comparing with current mobile frameworks supporting 3D CNNs, with moderate 1%~1.5% accuracy loss. The end-to-end inference time for 16 video frames could be within 150 ms, when executing representative C3D and R(2+1)D models on a cellphone. For the first time, real-time execution of 3D CNNs is achieved on off-the-shelf mobiles."}

In each period, the learning agent observes a d-dimensional contextual information about the user and the N available items, and offers an assortment of size K to the user, and observes the bandit feedback of the item chosen from the assortment. We propose upper confidence bound based algorithms for this MNL contextual bandit. The first algorithm is a simple and practical method that achieves an O(d√T) regret over T rounds. Next, we propose a second algorithm which achieves a O(√dT) regret. This matches the lower bound for the MNL bandit problem, up to logarithmic terms, and improves on the best-known result by a √d factor. To establish this sharper regret bound, we present a non-asymptotic confidence bound for the maximum likelihood estimator of the MNL model that may be of independent interest as its own theoretical contribution. We then revisit the simpler, significantly more practical, first algorithm and show that a simple variant of the algorithm achieves the optimal regret for a broad class of important applications."}

Computing the flow follows the change of variables formula and thus requires invertibility of the mapping and an efficient way to compute the determinant of its Jacobian. To satisfy these requirements, normalizing flows typically consist of carefully chosen components. Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) are mappings obtained by solving a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE). The neural ODE's dynamics can be chosen almost arbitrarily while ensuring invertibility. Moreover, the log-determinant of the flow's Jacobian can be obtained by integrating the trace of the dynamics' Jacobian along the flow. Our proposed OT-Flow approach tackles two critical computational challenges that limit a more widespread use of CNFs. First, OT-Flow leverages optimal transport (OT) theory to regularize the CNF and enforce straight trajectories that are easier to integrate. Second, OT-Flow features exact trace computation with time complexity equal to trace estimators used in existing CNFs. On five high-dimensional density estimation and generative modeling tasks, OT-Flow performs competitively to state-of-the-art CNFs while on average requiring one-fourth of the number of weights with an 8x speedup in training time and 24x speedup in inference."}

While NAS offers great promise, the prohibitive computational demand of most of the existing NAS methods makes it difficult to directly search the architectures on large-scale tasks. The typical way of conducting large scale NAS is to search for an architectural building block on a small dataset (either using a proxy set from the large dataset or a completely different small scale dataset) and then transfer the block to a larger dataset. Despite a number of recent results that show the promise of transfer from proxy datasets, a comprehensive evaluation of different NAS methods studying the impact of different source datasets has not yet been addressed. In this work, we propose to analyze the architecture transferability of different NAS methods by performing a series of experiments on large scale benchmarks such as ImageNet1K and ImageNet22K. We find that: (i) The size and domain of the  proxy set  does not seem to influence architecture performance on the target dataset. On average, transfer performance of architectures searched using completely different small datasets (e.g., CIFAR10) perform similarly to the architectures searched directly on proxy target datasets. However, design of proxy sets has considerable impact on rankings of different NAS methods. (ii) While different NAS methods show similar performance on a source dataset (e.g., CIFAR10), they significantly differ on the transfer performance to a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet1K). (iii) Even on large datasets, random sampling baseline is very competitive, but the choice of the appropriate combination of proxy set and search strategy can provide significant improvement over it. We believe that our extensive empirical analysis will prove useful for future design of NAS algorithms."}

Specifically, we revisit the benchmark problem of discrete-time linear quadratic regulation (LQR) and study the long-standing open question: Under what conditions is the policy iteration method robustly stable from a dynamical systems perspective? Using advanced stability results in control theory, it is shown that policy iteration for LQR is inherently robust to small errors in the learning process and enjoys small-disturbance input-to-state stability: whenever the error in each iteration is bounded and small, the solutions of the policy iteration algorithm are also bounded, and, moreover, enter and stay in a small neighborhood of the optimal LQR solution. As an application, a novel off-policy optimistic least-squares policy iteration for the LQR problem is proposed, when the system dynamics are subjected to additive stochastic disturbances. The proposed new results in robust reinforcement learning are validated by a numerical example."}

We design a new text-based gaming environment called TextWorld Commonsense (TWC) for training and evaluating RL agents with a specific kind of commonsense knowledge about objects, their attributes, and affordances. We also introduce several baseline RL agents which track the sequential context and dynamically retrieve the relevant commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet.

In this paper, we introduce a general consistency condition covering communication-reduced and asynchronous distributed SGD implementations.  Our framework, called elastic consistency, decouples the system-specific aspects of the implementation from the SGD convergence requirements, giving a general way to obtain convergence bounds for a wide variety of distributed SGD methods used in practice. Elastic consistency can be used to re-derive or improve several previous convergence bounds in message-passing and shared-memory settings, but also to analyze new models and distribution schemes. As a direct application, we propose and analyze a new synchronization-avoiding scheduling scheme for distributed SGD, and show that it can be used to efficiently train deep convolutional models for image classification."}

In this setup, each client’s data is private to itself and is not transferable to other clients or the server. Though FL paradigm has received significant interest recently from the research community, the problem of selecting the relevant clients w.r.t. the central server's learning objective is under-explored. We refer to these problems as Federated Relevant Client Selection (FRCS). Because the server doesn't have explicit control over the nature of data possessed by each client, the problem of selecting relevant clients is significantly complex in FL settings. In this paper, we resolve important and related FRCS problems viz., selecting clients with relevant data, detecting clients that possess data relevant to a particular target label, and rectifying corrupted data samples of individual clients. We follow a principled approach to address the above FRCS problems and develop a new federated learning method using the Shapley value concept from cooperative game theory. Towards this end, we propose a cooperative game involving the gradients shared by the clients. Using this game, we compute Shapley values of clients and then present Shapley value based Federated Averaging (S-FedAvg) algorithm that empowers the server to select relevant clients with high probability. S-FedAvg turns out to be critical in designing specific algorithms to address the FRCS problems. We finally conduct a thorough empirical analysis on image classification and speech recognition tasks to show the superior performance of S-FedAvg than the baselines in the context of supervised federated learning settings."}

A promising line of work exploits scalable matrix factorization for latent-space forecasting, but is limited to linear embeddings, unable to model distributions, and not trainable end-to-end when using deep learning forecasting. We introduce a novel temporal latent auto-encoder method which enables nonlinear factorization of multivariate time series, learned end-to-end with a temporal deep learning latent space forecast model.

In this paper, we propose a novel PU learning approach dubbed PULNS, equipped with an effective negative sample selector, which is optimized by reinforcement learning. Our PULNS approach employs an effective negative sample selector as the agent responsible for selecting negative samples from the unlabeled data. While the selected, likely negative samples can be used to improve the classifier, the performance of classifier is also used as the reward to improve the selector through the REINFORCE algorithm. By alternating the updates of the selector and the classifier, the performance of both is improved. Extensive experimental studies on 7 real-world application benchmarks demonstrate that PULNS consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in PU learning, and our experimental results also confirm the effectiveness of the negative sample selector underlying PULNS."}

We are interested in the scenario that the algorithm can only take one pass over the data with limited memory. The state-of-the-art deterministic sketching algorithm for streaming AMM is the co-occurring directions (COD), which has much smaller approximation errors than randomized algorithms and outperforms other deterministic sketching methods empirically. In this paper, we provide a tighter error bound for COD whose leading term considers the potential approximate low-rank structure and the correlation of input matrices.  We prove COD is space optimal with respect to our improved error bound. We also propose a variant of COD for sparse matrices with theoretical guarantees. The experiments on real-world sparse datasets show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than baseline methods."}

However, progress on transfer learning mainly focuses on optimizing the weights of pre-trained models, which ignores the structure mismatch between the model and the target task. This paper aims to improve the transfer performance from another angle - in addition to tuning the weights, we tune the structure of pre-trained models, in order to better match the target task. To this end, we propose TransTailor, targeting at pruning the pre-trained model for improved transfer learning. Different from traditional pruning pipelines, we prune and fine-tune the pre-trained model according to the target-aware weight importance, generating an optimal sub-model tailored for a specific target task. In this way, we transfer a more suitable sub-structure that can be applied during fine-tuning to benefit the final performance. Extensive experiments on multiple pre-trained models and datasets demonstrate that TransTailor outperforms the traditional pruning methods and achieves competitive or even better performance than other state-of-the-art transfer learning methods while using a smaller model. Notably, on the Stanford Dogs dataset, TransTailor can achieve 2.7% accuracy improvement over other transfer methods with 20% fewer FLOPs."}

To ensure users' privacy, differentially private federated learning has been intensively studied. The existing works are mainly based on the curator model or local model of differential privacy. However, both of them have pros and cons. The curator model allows greater accuracy but requires a trusted analyzer.  In the local model where users randomize local data before sending them to the analyzer, a trusted analyzer is not required but the accuracy is limited. In this work, by leveraging the textit{privacy amplification} effect in the recently proposed shuffle model of differential privacy, we achieve the best of two worlds, i.e., accuracy in the curator model and strong privacy without relying on any trusted party. We first propose an FL framework in the shuffle model and a simple protocol (SS-Simple) extended from existing work. We find that SS-Simple only provides an insufficient privacy amplification effect in FL since the dimension of the model parameter is quite large. To solve this challenge, we propose an enhanced protocol (SS-Double) to increase the privacy amplification effect by subsampling. Furthermore, for boosting the utility when the model size is greater than the user population, we propose an advanced protocol (SS-Topk) with gradient sparsification techniques. We also provide theoretical analysis and numerical evaluations of the privacy amplification of the proposed protocols. Experiments on real-world dataset validate that SS-Topk improves the testing accuracy by 60.7% than the local model based FL. We highlight an observation that SS-Topk improves the accuracy by 33.94% than the curator model based FL without any trusted party. Compared with non-private FL, our protocol SS-Topk only lose 1.48% accuracy under (2.348, 5e-6)-DP per epoch."}

We propose multipoint quantization, a quantization method that approximates a full-precision weight vector using a linear combination of multiple vectors of low-bit numbers;  this is in contrast to typical quantization methods that approximate each weight using a single low precision number.  Computationally, we construct the multipoint quantization with an efficient greedy selection procedure, and adaptively decides the number of low precision points on each quantized weight vector based on the error of its output.   This allows us to achieve higher precision levels for important weights that greatly influence the outputs, yielding an ``effect of mixed precision'' but without physical mixed precision implementations  (which requires specialized hardware accelerators).  Empirically, our method can be implemented by common operands, bringing almost no memory and computation overhead. We show that our method outperforms a range of state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet classification and it can be generalized to more challenging tasks like PASCAL VOC object detection."}

However, the performance of BERT-based models is mainly driven by the enormous amount of parameters, which hinders their application to resource-limited scenarios. Faced with this problem, recent studies have been attempting to compress BERT into a small-scale model. However, most previous work primarily focuses on a single kind of compression technique, and few attention has been paid to the combination of different methods. When BERT is compressed with integrated techniques, a critical question is how to design the entire compression framework to obtain the optimal performance. In response to this question, we integrate three kinds of compression methods (weight pruning, low-rank factorization and knowledge distillation (KD)) and explore a range of designs concerning model architecture, KD strategy, pruning frequency and learning rate schedule. We find that a careful choice of the designs is crucial to the performance of the compressed model. Based on the empirical findings, our best compressed model, dubbed Refined BERT cOmpreSsion with InTegrAted techniques (ROSITA), is 7.5x smaller than BERT while maintains 98.5% of the performance on five tasks of the GLUE benchmark, outperforming the previous BERT compression methods with similar parameter budget."}

However, due to the expensive evaluation cost of models (e.g., training deep learning models or training models on large datasets), vanilla Bayesian optimization (BO) is typically computationally infeasible.  To alleviate this issue, Hyperband (HB) utilizes the early stopping mechanism to speed up configuration evaluations by terminating those badly-performing configurations in advance. This leads to two kinds of quality measurements: (1) many low-fidelity measurements for configurations that get early-stopped, and (2) few high-fidelity measurements for configurations that are evaluated without being early stopped. The state-of-the-art HB-style method, BOHB, aims to combine the benefits of both BO and HB.  Instead of sampling configurations randomly in HB, BOHB samples configurations based on a BO surrogate model, which is constructed with the high-fidelity measurements only. However, the scarcity of high-fidelity measurements greatly hampers the efficiency of BO to guide the configuration search.  In this paper, we present MFES-HB, an efficient Hyperband method that is capable of utilizing both the high-fidelity and low-fidelity measurements to accelerate the convergence of HPO tasks. Designing MFES-HB is not trivial as the low-fidelity measurements can be biased yet informative to guide the configuration search. Thus we propose to build a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Surrogate (MFES) based on the generalized Product of Experts framework, which can integrate useful information from multi-fidelity measurements effectively. The empirical studies on the real-world AutoML tasks demonstrate that MFES-HB can achieve 3.3-8.9x speedups over the state-of-the-art approach --- BOHB."}

However, existing TNNs are mostly calculated based on rule-of-thumb quantization methods by simply thresholding operations, which  causes a significant accuracy loss. In this paper, we introduce a stem-residual framework which provides new  insight into Ternary quantization, termed Residual Quantization (TRQ), to achieve more powerful TNNs. Rather than directly thresholding operations, TRQ recursively performs quantization on full-precision weights for a  refined reconstruction by combining the binarized stem and residual parts. With such a unique quantization process, TRQ  endows the quantizer with high flexibility and precision. Our TRQ is generic, which can be easily extended to multiple bits through recursively encoded residual for  a better recognition accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields great recognition accuracy while being accelerated."}

By integrating both the residual input and residual learning to the design of neural channel decoder, DRN enables significant decoding performance improvement while maintaining low complexity.

We observe that an optimized CNN often has highly correlated filters as the number of channels increases with depth, reducing the expressive power of feature representations.     We propose Tied Block Convolution (TBC) that shares the same thinner filter over equal blocks of channels and produces multiple responses with a single filter. The concept of TBC can also be extended to group convolution and fully connected layers, and can be applied to various backbone networks and attention modules.  Our extensive experimentation on classification, detection, instance segmentation, and attention demonstrates that TBC is consistently leaner and significantly better than standard convolution and group convolution. On attention, with 64 times fewer parameters, our TiedSE performs on par with the standard SE.   On detection and segmentation, TBC can effectively handle highly overlapping instances, whereas standard CNNs often fail to accurately aggregate information in the presence of occlusion and result in multiple redundant partial object proposals.  By sharing filters across channels, TBC reduces correlation and delivers a sizable gain of 6% in the average precision for object detection on MS-COCO when the occlusion ratio is 80%."}

Various methods such as pairwise Markov Random Fields (pMRF) and graph neural networks were developed for semi-supervised node classification.    pMRF is more efficient than graph neural networks. However, existing pMRF-based methods are less accurate than graph neural networks, due to a key limitation that they assume a heuristics-based constant edge potential for all edges. In this work, we aim to address the key limitation of existing pMRF-based methods. In particular, we propose to learn edge potentials for pMRF.  Our evaluation results on   various types of graph datasets show that our optimized pMRF-based method consistently outperforms existing graph neural networks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

Such policies can be used for formal safety verification, agent behavior prediction, and manual inspection of important features. However, existing approaches fit a decision tree after training or use a custom learning procedure which is not compatible with new learning techniques, such as those which use neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) type for learning decision tree policies: Iterative Bounding MDPs (IBMDPs). An IBMDP is constructed around a base MDP so each IBMDP policy is guaranteed to correspond to a decision tree policy for the base MDP when using a method-agnostic masking procedure. Because of this decision tree equivalence, any function approximator can be used during training, including a neural network, while yielding a decision tree policy for the base MDP. We present the required masking procedure as well as a modified value update step which allows IBMDPs to be solved using existing algorithms. We apply this procedure to produce IBMDP variants of recent reinforcement learning methods. We empirically show the benefits of our approach by solving IBMDPs to produce decision tree policies for the base MDPs."}

To address this challenge, this paper studies a model that protects the privacy of the individuals’ sensitive information while also allowing it to learn non-discriminatory predictors. The method relies on the notion of differential privacy and the use of Lagrangian duality to design neural networks that can accommodate fairness constraints while guaranteeing the privacy of sensitive attributes. The paper analyses the tension between accuracy, privacy, and fairness and the experimental evaluation illustrates the benefits of the proposed model on several prediction tasks."}

Despite this, many explicit covariance functions of networks with activation functions used in modern networks remain unknown. Furthermore, while the kernels of deep networks can be computed iteratively, theoretical understanding of deep kernels is lacking, particularly with respect to fixed-point dynamics. Firstly, we derive the covariance functions of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with exponential linear units (ELU) and Gaussian error linear units (GELU) and evaluate the performance of the limiting Gaussian processes on some benchmarks. Secondly, and more generally, we analyse the fixed-point dynamics of iterated kernels corresponding to a broad range of activation functions. We find that unlike some previously studied neural network kernels, these new kernels exhibit non-trivial fixed-point dynamics which are mirrored in finite-width neural networks. The fixed point behaviour present in some networks explains a mechanism for implicit regularisation in overparameterised deep models.

Especially in healthcare settings these samples can be very expensive, meaning that one institution alone usually does not have enough. Merging privacy-sensitive data from different sources is usually restricted by data security and data protection measures. This can lead to approaches that reduce data quality by putting noise onto the variables (e.g., in epsilon-differential privacy) or omitting certain values (e.g., for k-anonymity). Other measures based on cryptographic methods can lead to very time-consuming computations, which is especially problematic for larger multi-omics data. We address this problem by introducing ESCAPED, which stands for Efficient SeCure And PrivatE Dot product framework. ESCAPED enables the computation of the dot product of vectors from multiple sources on a third-party, which later trains kernel-based machine learning algorithms, while neither sacrificing privacy nor adding noise. We have evaluated our framework on drug resistance prediction for HIV-infected people and multi-omics dimensionality reduction and clustering problems in precision medicine. In terms of execution time, our framework significantly outperforms the best-fitting existing approaches without sacrificing the performance of the algorithm. Even though we only present the benefit for kernel-based algorithms, our framework can open up new research opportunities for further machine learning models that require the dot product of vectors from multiple sources."}

Bayesian approaches including Bayesian Neural Nets (BNNs) do not scale well to modern computer vision tasks, as they are difficult to train, and have poor generalization under dataset-shift. This motivates the need for effective ensembles which can generalize and give reliable uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we target the problem of generating effective ensembles of neural networks by encouraging diversity in prediction. We explicitly optimize a diversity inducing adversarial loss for learning the stochastic latent variables and thereby obtain diversity in the output predictions necessary for modeling multi-modal data. We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR100, TinyImageNet and MIT Places 2, and compared to the most competitive baselines show significant improvements in classification accuracy, under a shift in the data distribution and in out-of-distribution detection. over 10% relative improvement in classification accuracy, over 5% relative improvement in generalizing under dataset shift, and over 5% better predictive uncertainty estimation as inferred by efficient out-of-distribution (OOD) detection."}

One notable open question is how to precisely describe the flexibility of point process models and whether there exists a general model that can represent all point processes. Our work bridges this gap. Focusing on the widely used event intensity function representation of point processes, we provide a proof that a class of learnable functions can universally approximate any valid intensity function. The proof connects the well known Stone-Weierstrass Theorem for function approximation, the uniform density of non-negative continuous functions using a transfer functions, the formulation of the parameters of a piece-wise continuous functions as a dynamic system, and a recurrent neural network implementation for capturing the dynamics. Using these insights, we design and implement UNIPoint, a novel neural point process model, using recurrent neural networks to parameterise sums of basis function upon each event. Evaluations on synthetic and real world datasets show that this simpler representation performs better than Hawkes process variants and more complex neural network-based approaches. We expect this result will provide a practical basis for selecting and tuning models, as well as furthering theoretical work on representational complexity and learnability."}

It saves much time for the generative model to initialize the latent variable by constraining a sampler to be close to the true posterior distribution. The initialized latent variable is then improved significantly by an MCMC sampler. Thus the proposed method has the strengths of both methods, i.e., the effectiveness of MCMC and the efficiency of variational inference.

TempLe gains sample efficiency by extracting similarities of the transition dynamics across tasks even when their underlying models or optimal policies have limited commonalities.

Value estimation, especially with function approximation, can be challenging since it involves the stochasticity of environmental dynamics and reward signals that can be sparse and delayed in some cases. A typical model-free RL algorithm usually estimates the values of a policy by Temporal Difference (TD) or Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms directly from rewards, without explicitly taking dynamics into consideration. In this paper, we propose Value Decomposition with Future Prediction (VDFP), providing an explicit two-step understanding of the value estimation process: 1) first foresee the latent future, 2) and then evaluate it. We analytically decompose the value function into a latent future dynamics part and a policy-independent trajectory return part, inducing a way to model latent dynamics and returns separately in value estimation. Further, we derive a practical deep RL algorithm, consisting of a convolutional model to learn compact trajectory representation from past experiences, a conditional variational auto-encoder to predict the latent future dynamics and a convex return model that evaluates trajectory representation.

In this paper, we propose a novel search strategy for one-shot and sparse propagation NAS, namely AdvantageNAS, which further reduces the time complexity of NAS by reducing the number of search iterations. AdvantageNAS is a gradient-based approach that improves the search efficiency by introducing credit assignment in gradient estimation for architecture updates. Experiments on the NAS-Bench-201 and PTB dataset show that AdvantageNAS discovers an architecture with higher performance under a limited time budget compared to existing sparse propagation NAS. To further reveal the reliabilities of AdvantageNAS, we investigate it theoretically and find that it monotonically improves the expected loss and thus converges."}

Popular forms of explanations map the features to a vector indicating their individual importance to a decision on the instance-level. They can then be used to prevent the model from learning the wrong bias in data possibly due to ambiguity. For instance, Ross et al.'s ``right for the right reasons'' propagates user explanations backwards to the network by formulating differentiable constraints based on input gradients.   Unfortunately, input gradients as well as many other widely used explanation methods form an approximation of the decision boundary and assume the underlying model to be fixed. Here, we demonstrate how to make use of influence functions---a well known robust statistic---in the constraints to correct the model’s behaviour more effectively. Our empirical evidence demonstrates that this ``right for better reasons''(RBR) considerably reduces the time to correct the classifier at training time and boosts the quality of explanations at inference time compared to input gradients. Besides, we also showcase the effectiveness of RBR in correcting \"Clever Hans\"-like behaviour in real, high-dimensional domain."}

Among them, local stochastic gradient descent (Local SGD) has attracted significant attention due to its low communication complexity. Previous studies prove that the communication complexity of Local SGD with a fixed or an adaptive communication period  is in the order of O (N3/2 T1/2) and O (N3/4 T3/4) when the data distributions on clients are identical (IID) or otherwise (Non-IID), where N is the number of clients and T is the number of iterations. In this paper, to accelerate the convergence by reducing the communication complexity, we propose STagewise Local SGD (STL-SGD), which increases the communication period gradually along with decreasing learning rate. We prove that STL-SGD can keep the same convergence rate and linear speedup as mini-batch SGD. In addition, as the benefit of increasing the communication period, when the objective is strongly convex or satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, the communication complexity of STL-SGD is O (N log T ) and O (N1/2 T1/2) for the IID case and the Non-IID case respectively, achieving significant improvements over Local SGD.

In this work, we use partial differential operators (PDOs) to design a spherical equivariant CNN, PDO-eS2CNN, which is exactly rotation equivariant in the continuous domain. We then discretize PDO-eS2CNNs, and analyze the equivariance error resulted from discretization. This is the first time that the equivariance error is theoretically analyzed in the spherical domain.  In experiments, PDO-eS2CNNs show greater parameter efficiency and outperform other spherical CNNs significantly on several tasks."}

A common practice for this task is to train a model on the base set first and then transfer to novel classes through fine-tuning or meta-learning. However, as the base classes have no overlap to the novel set, simply transferring whole knowledge from base data is not an optimal solution since some knowledge in the base model may be biased or even harmful to the novel class. In this paper, we propose to transfer partial knowledge by freezing or fine-tuning particular layer(s) in the base model. Specifically, layers will be imposed different learning rates if they are chosen to be fine-tuned, to control the extent of preserved transferability. To determine which layers to be recast and what values of learning rates for them, we introduce an evolutionary search based method that is efficient to simultaneously locate the target layers and determine their individual learning rates. We conduct extensive experiments on CUB and mini-ImageNet to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both meta-learning and non-meta based frameworks. Furthermore, we extend our method to the conventional pre-training + fine-tuning paradigm and obtain consistent improvement."}

Conventional regularization methods, such as dropout or weight decay, do not leverage the structures of the network's inputs and hidden states. As a result, these conventional methods are less effective than methods that leverage the structures, such as SpatialDropout and DropBlock, which randomly drop the values at certain contiguous areas in the hidden states and setting them to zero. Although the locations of dropping areas random, the patterns of SpatialDropout and DropBlock are manually designed and fixed. Here we propose to learn the dropping patterns. In our method, a controller learns to generate a dropping pattern at every channel and layer of a target network, such as a ConvNet or a Transformer. The target network is then trained with the dropping pattern, and its resulting validation performance is used as a signal for the controller to learn from. We show that this method works well for both image recognition on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, as well as language modeling on Penn Treebank and WikiText-2. The learned dropping patterns also transfers to different tasks and datasets, such as from language model on Penn Treebank to Engligh-French translation on WMT 2014.

Deep policy optimization methods have achieved impressive results on complex tasks, but their real-world adoption remains limited because they often require significant amounts of data to succeed. When combined with small sample sizes, these methods can result in unstable learning due to their reliance on high-dimensional sample-based estimates. In this work, we develop techniques to control the uncertainty introduced by these estimates. We leverage these techniques to propose a deep policy optimization approach designed to produce stable performance even when data is scarce. The resulting algorithm, Uncertainty-Aware Trust Region Policy Optimization, generates robust policy updates that adapt to the level of uncertainty present throughout the learning process."}

Compared to the prior work on online submodular maximization, our setting introduces the extra complication of stochastic linear constraint functions that are i.i.d. generated at each round. In particular, at each time step a DR-submodular utility function and a constraint vector, i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution, are revealed after committing to an action and we aim to maximize the overall utility while the expected cumulative resource consumption is below a fixed budget. Stochastic long-term constraints arise naturally in applications where there is a limited budget or resource available and resource consumption at each step is governed by stochastically time-varying environments. We propose the Online Lagrangian Frank-Wolfe (OLFW) algorithm to solve this class of online problems. We analyze the performance of the OLFW algorithm and we obtain sub-linear regret bounds as well as sub-linear cumulative constraint violation bounds, both in expectation and with high probability."}

Though Turing model is a simplification and an idealization, it is one of the best-known theoretical models to explain patterns as a reminiscent of those observed in nature. Over the years, concerted efforts have been made to align theoretical models to explain patterns in real systems. The apparent difficulty in identifying the specific dynamics of the RD system makes the problem particularly challenging. Interestingly, we observe Turing-like patterns in a system of neurons with adversarial interaction. In this study, we establish the involvement of Turing instability to create such patterns. By theoretical and empirical studies, we present a textit{pseudo-reaction-diffusion} model to explain the mechanism that may underlie these phenomena. While supervised learning attains homogeneous equilibrium, this paper suggests that the introduction of an adversary helps break this homogeneity to create non-homogeneous patterns at equilibrium. Further, we prove that randomly initialized gradient descent with over-parameterization can converge exponentially fast to an $epsilon$-stationary point even under adversarial interaction. In addition, different from sole supervision, we show that the solutions obtained under adversarial interaction are not limited to a tiny subspace around initialization."}

Existing works search for dataset-level augmentation policies without considering individual sample variations, which are likely to be sub-optimal. On the other hand, learning different policies for different samples naively could greatly increase the computing cost. In this paper, we learn a sample-aware data augmentation policy efficiently by formulating it as a sample reweighting problem. Specifically, an augmentation policy network takes a transformation and the corresponding augmented image as inputs, and outputs a weight to adjust the augmented image loss computed by a task network. At training stage, the task network minimizes the weighted losses of augmented training images, while the policy network minimizes the loss of the task network on a validation set via meta-learning. We theoretically prove the convergence of the training procedure and further derive the exact convergence rate. Superior performance is achieved on widely-used benchmarks including CIFAR-10/100, Omniglot, and ImageNet."}

Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which achieves O(L log L) in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem."}

In this paper, we follow the trend to propose a novel method to reduce the domain shift using strategies of discriminator attention and self-training. The discriminator attention strategy contains a two-stage adversarial learning process, which explicitly distinguishes the well-aligned (domain-invariant) and poorly-aligned (domain-specific) features, and then guides the model to focus on the latter. The self-training strategy adaptively improves the decision boundary of the model for the target domain, which implicitly facilitates the extraction of domain-invariant features. By combining the two strategies, we find a more effective way to reduce the domain shift. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on numerous benchmark datasets."}

We design a Dynamic Point-cloud Convolution (DConv) operator as the core component of CloudLSTMs, which performs convolution directly over point-clouds and extracts local spatial features from sets of neighboring points that surround different elements of the input. This operator maintains the permutation invariance of sequence-to-sequence learning frameworks, while representing neighboring correlations at each time step -- an important aspect in spatiotemporal predictive learning. The DConv operator resolves the grid-structural data requirements of existing spatiotemporal forecasting models and can be easily plugged into traditional LSTM architectures with sequence-to-sequence learning and attention mechanisms. We apply our proposed architecture to two representative, practical use cases that involve point-cloud streams, i.e. mobile service traffic forecasting and air quality indicator forecasting. Our results, obtained with real-world datasets collected in diverse scenarios for each use case, show that CloudLSTM delivers accurate long-term predictions, outperforming a variety of competitor neural network models."}

However, in deep semi-supervised learning (SSL), unknown threats mainly stem from the unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hidden backdoor (DeHiB) attack scheme for SSL-based systems. In contrast to the conventional attacking methods, the DeHiB can inject malicious unlabeled training data to the semi-supervised learner so as to enable the SSL model to output premeditated results. In particular, a robust adversarial perturbation generator regularized by a unified objective function is proposed to generate poisoned data. To alleviate the negative impact of the trigger patterns on model accuracy and improve the attack success rate, a novel contrastive data poisoning strategy is designed. Using the proposed data poisoning scheme, one can implant the backdoor into the SSL model using the raw data without hand-crafted labels. Extensive experiments based on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets demonstrated the effectiveness and crypticity of the proposed scheme."}

During the optimization, the bit-width of each layer / kernel in the model is at a fractional status of two consecutive bit-widths which can be adjusted gradually. With a differentiable regularization term, the resource constraints can be met during the quantization-aware training which results in an optimized mixed precision model.

With separate reward and safety signals, it is natural to cast it as constrained reinforcement learning, where expected long-term costs of policies are constrained. However, it can be hazardous to set constraints on the expected safety signal without considering the tail of the distribution. For instance, in safety-critical domains, worst-case analysis is required to avoid disastrous results. We present a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called Worst-Case Soft Actor Critic, which extends the Soft Actor Critic algorithm with a safety critic to achieve risk control. More specifically, a certain level of conditional Value-at-Risk from the distribution is regarded as a safety measure to judge the constraint satisfaction, which guides the change of adaptive safety weights to achieve a trade-off between reward and safety. As a result, we can optimize policies under the premise that their worst-case performance satisfies the constraints. The empirical analysis shows that our algorithm attains better risk control compared to expectation-based methods."}

In this paper, we compose a trilogy of exploring the basic and generic supervision in the sequence from spatial, spatiotemporal and sequential perspectives. We materialize the supervisory signals through determining whether a pair of samples is from one frame or from one video, and whether a triplet of samples is in the correct temporal order. We uniquely regard the signals as the foundation in contrastive learning and derive a particular form named Sequence Contrastive Learning (SeCo).

This is known as adversarial attacks. To counter adversarial attacks, adversarial training formulated as a form of robust optimization has been demonstrated to be effective. However, conducting adversarial training brings much computational overhead compared with standard training. In order to reduce the computational cost, we propose an annealing mechanism, Amata, to reduce the overhead associated with adversarial training. The proposed Amata is provably convergent, well-motivated from the lens of optimal control theory and can be combined with existing acceleration methods to further enhance performance. It is demonstrated that on standard datasets, Amata can achieve similar or better robustness with around 1/3 to 1/2 the computational time compared with traditional methods. In addition, Amata can be incorporated into  other adversarial training acceleration algorithms (e.g. YOPO, Free, Fast, and ATTA), which leads to further reduction in computational time on large-scale problems."}

EHR usually contains a mixture of structured (codes) and unstructured (free-text) data with sparse and irregular longitudinal features -- all of which doctors utilize when making decisions. In the deep learning regime, determining how different modality representations should be fused together is a difficult problem, which is often addressed by handcrafted modeling and intuition. In this work, we extend state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods and propose MUltimodal Fusion Architecture SeArch (MUFASA) to simultaneously search across multimodal fusion strategies and modality-specific architectures for the first time. We demonstrate empirically that our MUFASA method outperforms established unimodal NAS on public EHR data with comparable computation costs. In addition, MUFASA produces architectures that outperform Transformer and Evolved Transformer. Compared with these baselines on CCS diagnosis code prediction, our discovered models improve top-5 recall from 0.88 to 0.91 and demonstrate the ability to generalize to other EHR tasks. Studying our top architecture in depth, we provide empirical evidence that MUFASA's improvements are derived from its ability to both customize modeling for each modality and find effective fusion strategies."}

As a well-known one-shot solution, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) performs continuous relaxation on the architecture's importance and results in a bi-level optimization problem. However, as many recent studies have shown, DARTS cannot always work robustly for new tasks, which is mainly due to the approximate solution of the bi-level optimization. In this paper, one-shot neural architecture search is addressed by adopting a directed probabilistic graphical model to represent the joint probability distribution over data and model. Then, neural architectures are searched for and optimized by Gibbs sampling. We rethink the bi-level optimization problem as the task of Gibbs sampling from the posterior distribution, which expresses the preferences for different models given the observed dataset. We evaluate our proposed NAS method -- GibbsNAS on the search space used in DARTS/ENAS and the search space of NAS-Bench-201. Experimental results on multiple search space show the efficacy and stability of our approach."}

Bayesian optimization (BO), which has long had success in hyperparameter optimization, has recently emerged as a very promising strategy for NAS when it is coupled with a neural predictor. Recent work has proposed different instantiations of this framework, for example, using Bayesian neural networks or graph convolutional networks as the predictive model within BO. However, the analyses in these papers often focus on the full-fledged NAS algorithm, so it is difficult to tell which individual components of the framework lead to the best performance.  In this work, we give a thorough analysis of the \"BO + neural predictor framework\" by identifying five main components: the architecture encoding, neural predictor, uncertainty calibration method, acquisition function, and acquisition function optimization. We test several different methods for each component and also develop a novel path-based encoding scheme for neural architectures, which we show theoretically and empirically scales better than other encodings. Using all of our analyses, we develop a final algorithm called BANANAS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on NAS search spaces.

To make progress in this direction, we study a smooth analogue of Q-learning. We start by showing that our learning model has strong theoretical justification as an optimal model for studying exploration-exploitation. Specifically, we prove that smooth Q-learning has bounded regret in arbitrary games for a cost model that explicitly captures the balance between game and exploration costs and that it always converges to the set of quantal-response equilibria (QRE), the standard solution concept for games under bounded rationality, in weighted potential games with heterogeneous learning agents. In our main task, we then turn to measure the effect of exploration in collective system performance. We characterize the geometry of the QRE surface in low-dimensional MAL systems and link our findings with catastrophe (bifurcation) theory. In particular, as the exploration hyperparameter evolves over-time, the system undergoes phase transitions where the number and stability of equilibria can change radically given an infinitesimal change to the exploration parameter. Based on this, we provide a formal theoretical treatment of how tuning the exploration parameter can provably lead to equilibrium selection with both positive as well as negative (and potentially unbounded) effects to system performance."}

It becomes a key problem to model the intention by some proper abstraction. Currently, it is either too coarse such as final goals or too fined as primitive steps, which is inefficient due to the lack of modularity and semantics. In this paper, we design a novel multi-agent coordination protocol based on subgoal intentions, defined as the probability distribution over feasible subgoal sequences. The subgoal intentions encode macro-action behaviors with modularity so as to facilitate joint decision making at higher abstraction. Built over the proposed protocol, we present Dec-SGTS (Decentralized Sub-Goal Tree Search) to solve decentralized online multi-agent planning hierarchically and efficiently. Each agent runs Dec-SGTS asynchronously by iteratively performing three phases including local sub-goal tree search, local subgoal intention update and global subgoal intention sharing. We conduct the experiments on courier dispatching problem, and the results show that Dec-SGTS achieves much better reward while enjoying a significant reduction of planning time and communication cost compared with Dec-MCTS (Decentralized Monte Carlo Tree Search)."}

In this paper, we move away from the artificial divide between dynamic agents and static games, to introduce and analyze a large class of competitive settings where both the agents and the games they play evolve strategically over time. We focus on arguably the most archetypal game-theoretic setting---zero-sum games (as well as network generalizations)---and the most studied evolutionary learning dynamic---replicator, the continuous-time analogue of multiplicative weights. Populations of agents compete against each other in a zero-sum competition that itself evolves adversarially to the current population mixture. Remarkably, despite the chaotic coevolution of agents and games, we prove that the system exhibits a number of regularities. First, the system has conservation laws of an information-theoretic flavor that couple the behavior of all agents and games. Secondly, the system is Poincare recurrent, with effectively all possible initializations of agents and games lying on recurrent orbits that come arbitrarily close to their initial conditions infinitely often. Thirdly, the time-average agent behavior and utility converge to the Nash equilibrium values of the time-average game. Finally, we provide a polynomial time algorithm to efficiently predict this time-average behavior for any such coevolving network game."}

Algorithmic influence maximization techniques have been proposed to aid with the choice of ``peer leaders'' or ``influencers'' in such interventions. Yet, traditional algorithms for influence maximization have not been designed with these interventions in mind. As a result, they may disproportionately exclude minority communities from the benefits of the intervention. This has motivated research on fair influence maximization. Existing techniques come with two major drawbacks. First, they require committing to a single fairness measure. Second, these measures are typically imposed as strict constraints leading to undesirable properties such as wastage of resources. To address these shortcomings, we provide a principled characterization of the properties that a fair influence maximization algorithm should satisfy. In particular, we propose a framework based on social welfare theory, wherein the cardinal utilities derived by each community are aggregated using the isoelastic social welfare functions. Under this framework, the trade-off between fairness and efficiency can be controlled by a single inequality aversion design parameter. We then show under what circumstances our proposed principles can be satisfied by a welfare function. The resulting optimization problem is monotone and submodular and can be solved efficiently with optimality guarantees. Our framework encompasses as special cases leximin and proportional fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real world datasets including a case study on landslide risk management demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework."}

The proposed indicator describes the maximum loss variation in the non-trivial worst-case scenario under parameter corruption. For practical purposes, we give a gradient-based estimation, which is far more effective than random corruption trials that can hardly induce the worst accuracy degradation. Equipped with theoretical support and empirical validation, we are able to systematically investigate the robustness of different model parameters and reveal vulnerability of deep neural networks that has been rarely paid attention to before. Moreover, we can enhance the models accordingly with the proposed adversarial corruption-resistant training, which not only improves the parameter robustness but also translates into accuracy elevation."}

In this paper, we argue that DNN interpretability should be implemented as the interactions between users and models. We present i-Algebra, a first-of-its-kind interactive framework for interpreting DNNs. At its core is a library of atomic, composable operators, which explain model behaviors at varying input granularity, during different inference stages, and from distinct interpretation perspectives. Leveraging a declarative query language, users are enabled to build various analysis tools (e.g., ``drill-down'', ``comparative'', ``what-if'' analysis) via flexibly composing such operators. We prototype i-Algebra and conduct user studies in a set of representative analysis tasks, including inspecting adversarial inputs, resolving model inconsistency, and cleansing contaminated data, all demonstrating its promising usability."}

Modern agent architectures, such as those trained by deep reinforcement learning, are currently so lacking in interpretable structure as to effectively be black boxes, but insights may still be gained from an external, behaviourist perspective. Inspired by conceptual spaces theory, we suggest that a versatile first step towards general understanding is to discretise the state space into convex regions, jointly capturing similarities over the agent's action, value function and temporal dynamics within a dataset of observations. We create such a representation using a novel variant of the CART decision tree algorithm, and demonstrate how it facilitates practical understanding of black box agents through prediction, visualisation and rule-based explanation."}

Most analyses using such methods explain decisions in response to inputs drawn from the test set. However, the test set may have few  examples that trigger some model behaviors, such as high-confidence failures or ambiguous classifications. To address these challenges, we introduce a flexible model inspection framework: Bayes-TrEx. Given a data distribution, Bayes-TrEx finds in-distribution examples which trigger a specified prediction confidence. We demonstrate several use cases of Bayes-TrEx, including revealing highly confident (mis)classifications, visualizing class boundaries via ambiguous examples, understanding novel-class extrapolation behavior, and exposing neural network overconfidence. We use Bayes-TrEx to study classifiers trained on CLEVR, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST, and we show that this framework enables more flexible holistic model analysis than just inspecting the test set.

These methods generally return either a weighting or subset of input features as an explanation for the classification of an instance. An alternative literature argues instead that counterfactual instances, which alter the black-box model's classification, provide a more actionable form of explanation. We present Feature Importance by Minimal Adversarial Perturbation (FIMAP), a neural network based approach that unifies feature importance and counterfactual explanations. We show that this approach combines the two paradigms, recovering the output of feature-weighting methods in continuous feature spaces, whilst indicating the direction in which the nearest counterfactuals can be found. Our method also provides an implicit confidence estimate in its own explanations, something existing methods lack. Additionally, FIMAP improves upon the speed of sampling-based methods, such as LIME, by an order of magnitude, allowing for explanation deployment in time-critical applications. We extend our approach to categorical features using a partitioned Gumbel layer and demonstrate its efficacy on standard datasets."}

Our main contributions are a new paradigm for estimating such models using a rudimentary query interface with the agent and a hierarchical querying algorithm that generates an interrogation policy for estimating the agent's internal model in a user-interpretable vocabulary. Empirical evaluation of our approach shows that despite the intractable search space of possible agent models, our approach allows correct and scalable estimation of interpretable agent models for a wide class of black-box autonomous agents. Our results also show that this approach can use predicate classifiers to learn interpretable models of planning agents that represent states as images."}

We propose a method that can be used to deploy the volunteers in the system, based on the real time distribution of the bikes in different stations. To account for (random) route demand in the network, we solve a related transshipment network design model and construct a sparse structure to restrict the re-balancing activities of the volunteers (concentrating re-balancing activities on essential routes). We also develop a comprehensive simulation model using a threshold-based policy to deploy the volunteers in real time,  to test the effect of choice restriction on volunteers (suitably deployed) to re-position bikes.  We use the Hubway system in Boston (with 60 stations) to demonstrate that using a sparse structure to concentrate the re-balancing activities of the volunteers, instead of allowing all admissible flows in the system (as in current practice),  can reduce the number of re-balancing moves by a huge amount, losing only a small proportion of demand satisfied."}

This is achieved through the use of a perception function providing the likelihood of a real-value observation being in a given state of the planning domain after executing an action. The agent learns an extensional representation of the domain (the set of states, the transitions from states to states caused by actions) and the perception function on-line, while it acts for accomplishing its task. In order to provide a practical approach that can scale up to large state spaces, a “draft” intensional (PDDL-based) model of the planning domain is used to guide the exploration of the environment and learn the states and state transitions. The proposed approach uses a novel algorithm to (i) construct the extensional representation of the domain by interleaving symbolic planning in the PDDL intensional representation and search in the state transition graph of the extensional representation; (ii) incrementally refine the intensional representation taking into account information about the actions that the agent cannot execute. An experimental analysis shows that the novel approach can scale up to large state spaces, thus overcoming the limits in scalability of the previous work."}

They also form a natural bridge between model-based and model-free RL methods: like the former they make predictions about future experiences, and like the latter they allow efficient prediction of total discounted rewards. However, successor-style representations are not optimized to generalize across policies: typically, we maintain a limited-length list of policies, and share information among them by representation learning or GPI. Successor-style representations also typically make no provision for gathering information or reasoning about latent variables. To address these limitations, we bring together ideas from predictive state representations, belief space value iteration, successor features, and convex analysis: we develop a new, general successor-style representation, together with a Bellman equation that connects multiple sources of information within this representation, including different latent states, policies, and reward functions. The new representation is highly expressive: for example, it lets us efficiently read off an optimal policy for a new reward function, or a policy that imitates a new demonstration. For this paper, we focus on exact computation of the new representation in small, known environments, since even this restricted setting offers plenty of interesting questions. Our implementation does not scale to large, unknown environments --- nor would we expect it to, since it generalizes POMDP value iteration, which is difficult to scale. However, we believe that future work will allow us to extend our ideas to approximate reasoning in large, unknown environments. We conduct experiments to explore which of the potential barriers to scaling are most pressing."}

GLIB samples relational conjunctive goals that can be understood as specific, targeted effects that the agent would like to achieve in the world, and plans to achieve these goals using the transition model being learned. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that exploration with GLIB will converge almost surely to the ground truth model.

CBS is a leading two-level search algorithm for solving MAPF optimally. ECBS is a bounded-suboptimal variant of CBS that uses focal search to speed up CBS by sacrificing optimality and instead guaranteeing that the costs of its solutions are within a given factor of optimal. In this paper, we study how to decrease its runtime even further using inadmissible heuristics.  Motivated by Explicit Estimation Search (EES), we propose Explicit Estimation CBS (EECBS), a new bounded-suboptimal variant of CBS, that uses online learning to obtain inadmissible estimates of the cost of the solution of each high-level node and uses EES to choose which high-level node to expand next. We also investigate recent improvements of CBS and adapt them to EECBS.  We find that EECBS with the improvements runs significantly faster than the state-of-the-art bounded-suboptimal MAPF algorithms ECBS, BCP-7, and eMDD-SAT on a variety of MAPF instances. We hope that the scalability of EECBS enables additional applications for bounded-suboptimal MAPF algorithms."}

While a simple genetic algorithm recently showed end-to-end training is possible, it failed to solve a more complex 3D task. This paper presents a method called Deep Innovation Protection (DIP) that addresses the credit assignment problem in training complex heterogenous neural network models end-to-end for such  environments. The main idea behind the approach is to employ multiobjective optimization to temporally reduce the selection pressure on specific components in multi-component network, allowing other components to adapt. We investigate the emergent representations of these evolved networks, which learn to predict properties important for the survival of the agent, without the need for a specific forward-prediction loss."}

Second, a variant of configuration checking named BoundedCC is designed by setting an upper bound for the threshold of forbidding strength. When the threshold value of vertex exceeds the upper bound, we reset its threshold value to increase the diversity of search process. Experiments on a broad range of classic benchmarks and sparse instances show that NuQClq significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MQCP algorithms for most instances."}

This length limit is fixed based on the validation set, resulting in the lack of flexibility. In this work, we propose a more flexible and accurate non-autoregressive method for single document extractive summarization, extracting a non-fixed number of summary sentences without the sorting step. We call our approach ThresSum as it picks sentences simultaneously and individually from the source document when the predicted probabilities exceed a threshold. During training, the model enhances sentence representation through iterative refinement and the intermediate latent variables receive some weak supervision with soft labels, which are generated progressively by adjusting the temperature with a knowledge distillation algorithm. Specifically, the temperature is initialized with high value and drops along with the iteration until a temperature of 1. Experimental results on CNN/DM and NYT datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of ThresSum, which significantly outperforms BERTSUMEXT with a substantial improvement of 0.74 ROUGE-1 score on CNN/DM.

In this paper, we propose an innovative Examination-type Question Generation approach (EQG-RACE) to generate exam-like questions based on a dataset extracted from RACE. Two main strategies are employed in EQG-RACE for dealing with discrete answer information and reasoning among long contexts. A Rough Answer and Key Sentence Tagging scheme is utilized to enhance the representations of input. An Answer-guided Graph Convolutional Network (AG-GCN) is designed to capture structure information in revealing the inter-sentences and intra-sentence relations. Experimental results show a state-of-the-art performance of EQG-RACE, which is apparently superior to the baselines. In addition, our work has established a new QG prototype with a reshaped dataset and QG method, which provides an important benchmark for related research in future work.

However, such exercises are hard to follow without expert guidance. Even if experts can help, it is almost impossible to give personalized feedback to every trainee remotely. Thus, automated pose correction systems are required more than ever, and we introduce a new captioning dataset named FixMyPose to address this need. We collect natural language descriptions of correcting a “current” pose to look like a “target” pose. To support a multilingual setup, we collect descriptions in both English and Hindi. The collected descriptions have interesting linguistic properties such as egocentric relations to the environment objects, analogous references, etc., requiring an understanding of spatial relations and commonsense knowledge about postures. Further, to avoid ML biases, we maintain a balance across characters with diverse demographics, who perform a variety of movements in several interior environments (e.g., homes, offices). From our FixMyPose dataset, we introduce two tasks: the pose-correctional-captioning task and its reverse, the target-pose-retrieval task. During the correctional-captioning task, models must generate the descriptions of how to move from the current to the target pose image, whereas in the retrieval task, models should select the correct target pose given the initial pose and the correctional description. We present strong cross-attention baseline models (uni/multimodal, RL, multilingual) and also show that our baselines are competitive with other models when evaluated on other image-difference datasets. We also propose new task-specific metrics (object-match, body-part-match, direction-match) and conduct human evaluation for more reliable evaluation, and we demonstrate a large human-model performance gap suggesting room for promising future work. Finally, to verify the sim-to-real transfer of our FixMyPose dataset, we collect a set of real images and show promising performance on these images.

However, undesired patterns in the collected data can make such tests incorrect. For example, if the feminine subset of a gender-bias-measuring coreference resolution dataset contains sentences with a longer average distance between the pronoun and the correct candidate, an RNN-based model may perform worse on this subset due to long-term dependencies. In this work, we introduce a theoretically grounded method for weighting test samples to cope with such patterns in the test data. We demonstrate the method on the GAP dataset for coreference resolution. We annotate GAP with spans of all personal names and show that examples in the female subset contain more personal names and a longer distance between pronouns and their referents, potentially affecting the bias score in an undesired way. Using our weighting method, we find the set of weights on the test instances that should be used for coping with these correlations,   and we re-evaluate 16 recently released coreference models."}

We bootstrap the classifier using the new data that are labeled by the combination of the classifier and the constructed lexicons to improve the prediction accuracy. As a result, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods including semi-supervised learning algorithms and pretraining algorithms for  few-shot text classification task on four publicly available benchmark datasets. Moreover, we empirically confirm that the constructed lexicons are reliable enough and substantially improve the performance of the original classifier."}

Because adversarial feedback alone is not sufficient to train the generator, current models still require the reconstruction loss compared with the ground-truth and the generated mel-spectrogram directly. In this paper, we present Multi-SpectroGAN (MSG), which can train the multi-speaker model with only the adversarial feedback by conditioning a self-supervised hidden representation of the generator to a conditional discriminator. This leads to better guidance for generator training. Moreover, we also propose  adversarial style combination (ASC) for better generalization in the unseen speaking style and transcript, which can learn latent representations of the combined style embedding from multiple mel-spectrograms. Trained with ASC and feature matching, the MSG synthesizes a high-diversity mel-spectrogram by controlling and mixing the individual speaking styles (e.g., duration, pitch, and energy). The result shows that the MSG synthesizes a high-fidelity mel-spectrogram, which has almost the same naturalness MOS score as the ground-truth mel-spectrogram."}

Such variation in word usage is often called lexical semantic change (LSC). The goal of LSC is to characterize and quantify language variations with respect to word meaning, to measure how distinct two language sources are (that is, people or language models). Because there is hardly any data available for such a task, most solutions involve unsupervised methods to align two embeddings and predict semantic change with respect to a distance measure. To that end, we propose a self-supervised approach to model lexical semantic change based on the perturbation of word vectors in the input corpora. We show that our method can be used for the detection of semantic change with any alignment method. Furthermore, it can be used to choose the landmark words to use in alignment and can lead to substantial improvements over the existing techniques for alignment.  We illustrate the utility of our techniques using experimental results on three different datasets, involving words with the same or different meanings. Our methods not only provide significant improvements but also can lead to novel findings for the LSC problem."}

Such token-level encoding hinders the exploration of discourse-level coherence among utterances. This paper presents DialogBERT, a novel conversational response generation model that enhances previous PLM-based dialogue models. DialogBERT employs a hierarchical Transformer architecture. To efficiently capture the discourse-level coherence among utterances, we propose two training objectives, including masked utterance regression and distributed utterance order ranking in analogy to the original BERT training. Experiments on three multi-turn conversation datasets show that our approach remarkably outperforms three baselines, such as BART and DialoGPT, in terms of quantitative evaluation. The human evaluation suggests that DialogBERT generates more coherent, informative, and human-like responses than the baselines with significant margins."}

Most existing approaches relying on adequate context for long text EL are not effective for the concise and sparse short text. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Multi-turn Multiple-choice Machine reading comprehension (M3) to solve the short text EL from a new perspective: a query is generated for each ambiguous mention exploiting its surrounding context, and an option selection module is employed to identify the golden entity from candidates using the query. In this way, M3 framework sufficiently interacts limited context with candidate entities during the encoding process, as well as implicitly considers the dissimilarities inside the candidate bunch in the selection stage. In addition, we design a two-stage verifier incorporated into M3 to address the commonly existed unlinkable problem in short text. To further consider the topical coherence and interdependence among referred entities, M3 leverages a multi-turn fashion to deal with mentions in a sequence manner by retrospecting historical cues. Evaluation shows that our M3 framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on five Chinese and English datasets for the real-world short text EL."}

As a consequence of this phenomenon, models trained on sentences with randomly permuted word order perform close to state-of-the-art models. To alleviate these issues, we show that if models are explicitly trained to recognize invalid inputs, they can be robust to such attacks without a drop in performance."}

Counterfactual story rewriting is a recently proposed task to test the causal reasoning ability for text generation models, which requires a model to predict the corresponding story ending when the condition is modified to a counterfactual one. Previous works have shown that the traditional sequence-to-sequence model cannot well handle this problem, as it often captures some spurious correlations between the original and counterfactual endings, instead of the causal relations between conditions and endings. To address this issue, we propose a sketch-and-customize generation model guided by the causality implicated in the conditions and endings. In the sketch stage, a skeleton is extracted by removing words which are conflict to the counterfactual condition, from the original ending. In the customize stage, a generation model is used to fill proper words in the skeleton under the guidance of the counterfactual condition. In this way, the obtained counterfactual ending is both relevant to the original ending and consistent with the counterfactual condition. Experimental results show that the proposed model generates much better endings, as compared with the traditional sequence-to-sequence model."}

Prior work strives to attribute model decisions to individual input features with different saliency measures, but they fail to explain how these input features interact with each other to reach predictions. In this paper, we propose a self-attention attribution method to interpret the information interactions inside Transformer. We take BERT as an example to conduct extensive studies. Firstly, we apply self-attention attribution to identify the important attention heads, while others can be pruned with marginal performance degradation. Furthermore, we extract the most salient dependencies in each layer to construct an attribution tree, which reveals the hierarchical interactions inside Transformer. Finally, we show that the attribution results can be used as adversarial patterns to implement non-targeted attacks towards BERT."}

This technique has been applied to machine translation, and dialog response generation. Previous work usually used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to generate lexically constrained sentences, but they randomly determined the position to be edited and the action to be taken, resulting in many invalid refinements. To overcome this challenge, we used a classifier to instruct the MCMC-based models where and how to refine the candidate sentences. First, we developed two methods to create synthetic data on which the pre-trained model is fine-tuned to obtain a reliable classifier. Next, we proposed a two-step approach, “Predict and Revise”, for constrained sentence generation. During the predict step, we leveraged the classifier to compute the learned prior for the candidate sentence. During the revise step, we resorted to MCMC sampling to revise the candidate sentence by conducting a sampled action at a sampled position drawn from the learned prior. We compared our proposed models with many strong baselines on two tasks, generating sentences with lexical constraints and text infilling. Experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed model performs much better than the previous work in terms of sentence fluency and diversity.

To address such limits of neural solvers, we introduce the concept of a situation model, which originates from psychology studies to represent the mental states of humans in problem-solving, and propose SMART, which adopts attributed grammar as the representation of situation models for algebra story problems. Specifically, we first train an information extraction module to extract nodes, attributes and relations from problem texts and then generate a parse graph based on a pre-defined attributed grammar. An iterative learning strategy is also proposed to further improve the performance of SMART. To study this task more rigorously, we carefully curate a new dataset named ASP6.6k. Experimental results on ASP6.6k show that the proposed model outperforms all previous neural solvers by a large margin, while preserving much better interpretability. To test these models' generalization capability, we also design an out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation, in which problems are more complex than those in the training set. Our model exceeds state-of-the-art models by 17% in the OOD evaluation, demonstrating its superior generalization ability."}

People have recently started to turn to online health communities to seek empathetic support when they undergo difficult situations such as suffering from a life-threatening disease, while others are there to provide empathetic support to those who need it. It is, therefore, important to detect the direction of empathy expressed in natural language. Previous studies only focus on the presence of empathy at a high-level and do not distinguish the direction of empathy that is expressed in textual messages. In this paper, we take one step further in the identification of perceived empathy from text by introducing IEMPATHIZE, a dataset of messages annotated with the direction of empathy exchanged in an online cancer network. We analyze user messages to identify the direction of empathy at a fine-grained level: seeking or providing empathy. Our dataset IEMPATHIZE serves as a challenging benchmark for studying empathy at a fine-grained level."}

To remedy this, we propose a novel Cluster-to-Cluster generation framework for Data Augmentation (DA), named C2C-GenDA. It enlarges the training set by reconstructing existing utterances into alternative expressions while keeping semantic. Different from previous DA works that reconstruct utterances one by one independently, C2C-GenDA jointly encodes multiple existing utterances of the same semantics and simultaneously decodes multiple unseen expressions. Jointly generating multiple new utterances allows to consider the relations between generated instances and encourages diversity. Besides, encoding multiple existing utterances endows C2C with a wider view of existing expressions, helping to reduce generation that duplicates existing data. Experiments on ATIS and Snips datasets show that instances augmented by C2C-GenDA improve slot filling by 7.99 (11.9%↑) and 5.76 (13.6%↑) F-scores respectively, when there are only hundreds of training utterances.

Previous works in persuasiveness prediction do not consider this relation in their architectures.  To take argument structure information into account, this paper proposes an approach to persuasiveness prediction with a novel graph-based neural network model, called heterogeneous argument attention network (HARGAN). By jointly training on the persuasiveness and stance of the replies, our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ChangeMyView (CMV) dataset for the persuasiveness prediction task. Experimental results show that the graph setting enables our model to aggregate information across multiple paragraphs effectively.

Recently, the predictor-estimator framework trains the predictor as a feature extractor, which leverages the extra parallel corpora without QE labels, achieving promising QE performance. However, we argue that there are gaps between the predictor and the estimator in both data quality and training objectives, which preclude QE models from benefiting from a large number of parallel corpora more directly. We propose a novel framework called DirectQE that provides a direct pretraining for QE tasks. In DirectQE, a generator is trained to produce pseudo data that is closer to the real QE data, and a detector is pretrained on these data with novel objectives that are akin to the QE task. Experiments on widely used benchmarks show that DirectQE outperforms existing methods, without using any pretraining models such as BERT. We also give extensive analyses showing how fixing the two gaps contributes to our improvements."}

Existing methods are limited by the amount of parallel corpus. Can we build a system to fully utilize signals in a parallel ST corpus?

In this paper, we propose Listen-Understand-Translate, (LUT), a unified framework with triple supervision signals to decouple the end-to-end speech-to-text translation task. LUT is able to guide the acoustic encoder to extract as much information from the auditory input. In addition, LUT utilizes a pre-trained BERT model to enforce the upper encoder to produce as much semantic information as possible, without extra data.

Recent research has attempted to accelerate RNN models by developing mechanisms to skip irrelevant words in input. Due to the lack of labelled data, it remains as a challenge to decide which words to skip, especially for low-resource classification tasks. In this paper, we propose Knowledge-AwareLeap-LSTM (KALL), a novel architecture which integrates prior human knowledge (created either manually or automatically)  like in-domain keywords,  terminologies or lexicons into Leap-LSTM to partially supervise the skipping process. More specifically,  we propose a knowledge-oriented cost function for KALL; furthermore, we propose two strategies to integrate the knowledge: (1) the Factored KALL approach involves a keyword indicator as a soft constraint for the skip-ping process, and (2) the Gated KALL enforces the inclusion of keywords while maintaining a differentiable network in training. Experiments on different public datasets show that our approaches are1.1x~2.6x faster than LSTM with better accuracy and 23.6x faster than XLNet in a resource-limited CPU-only environment."}

However, when applied to zero-shot cross-lingual transfer tasks, most existing methods use only single-language input for LM finetuning, without leveraging the intrinsic cross-lingual alignment between different languages that proves essential for multilingual tasks. In this paper, we propose FILTER, an enhanced fusion method that takes cross-lingual data as input for XLM finetuning. Specifically, FILTER first encodes text input in the source language and its translation in the target language independently in the shallow layers, then performs cross-language fusion to extract multilingual knowledge in the intermediate layers, and finally performs further language-specific encoding. During inference, the model makes predictions based on the text input in the target language and its translation in the source language. For simple tasks such as classification, translated text in the target language shares the same label as the source language. However, this shared label becomes less accurate or even unavailable for more complex tasks such as question answering, NER and POS tagging. To tackle this issue, we further propose an additional KL-divergence self-teaching loss for model training, based on auto-generated soft pseudo-labels for translated text in the target language.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that FILTER achieves new state of the art on two challenging multilingual multi-task benchmarks, XTREME and XGLUE."}

Existing work for discontinuous NER, however, either suffers from decoding ambiguity or predicting using token-level local features. In this work, we present an innovative model for discontinuous NER based on pointer networks, where the pointer simultaneously decides whether a token at each decoding frame constitutes an entity mention and where the next constituent token is. Our model has three major merits compared with previous work: (1) The pointer mechanism is memory-augmented, which enhances the mention boundary detection and interactions between the current decision and prior recognized mentions. (2) The encoder-decoder architecture can linearize the complexity of structure prediction, and thus reduce search costs. (3) The model makes every decision using global information, i.e., by consulting all the input, encoder and previous decoder output in a global view. Experimental results on the CADEC and ShARe13 datasets show that our model outperforms flat and hypergraph models as well as a state-of-the-art transition-based model for discontinuous NER. Further in-depth analysis demonstrates that our model performs well in recognizing various entities including flat, overlapping and discontinuous ones. More crucially, our model is effective on boundary detection, which is the kernel source to NER."}

Human emotions are highly complex as humans can express multiple emotions with varying intensity in a single utterance, whereas the conversational agents convey only one emotion in their responses. To infuse human-like behaviour in the agents, we introduce the task of multi-emotion controllable response generation with the ability to express different emotions with varying levels of intensity in an open-domain dialogue system. We introduce a Multiple Emotion Intensity aware Multi-party Dialogue (MEIMD) dataset having 34k conversations taken from 8 different TV Series. We finally propose a Multiple Emotion with Intensity-based Dialogue Generation (MEI-DG) framework. The system employs two novel mechanisms: viz. (i) determining the trade-off between the emotion and generic words,  while focusing on the intensity of the desired emotions; and (ii) computing the amount of emotion left to be expressed, thereby regulating the generation accordingly. The detailed evaluation shows that our proposed approach attains superior performance compared to the baseline models."}

In this work, we propose a knowledge distillation method LRC-BERT based on contrastive learning to fit the output of the intermediate layer from the angular distance aspect, which is not considered by the existing distillation methods. Furthermore, we introduce a gradient perturbation-based training architecture in the training phase to increase the robustness of LRC-BERT, which is the first attempt in knowledge distillation. Additionally, in order to better capture the distribution characteristics of the intermediate layer, we design a two-stage training method for the total distillation loss. Finally, by verifying 8 datasets on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, the performance of the proposed LRC-BERT exceeds the existing state-of-the-art methods, which proves the effectiveness of our method."}

Nearly all state-of-the-art language models and pre-trained language models are based on the Transformer architecture. However, it distinguishes sequential tokens only with the token position index. We hypothesize that better contextual representations can be generated from the Transformer with richer positional information. To verify this, we propose a segment-aware Transformer (Segatron), by replacing the original token position encoding with a combined position encoding of paragraph, sentence, and token. We first introduce the segment-aware mechanism to Transformer-XL, which is a popular Transformer-based language model with memory extension and relative position encoding. We find that our method can further improve the Transformer-XL base model and large model, achieving 17.1 perplexity on the WikiText-103 dataset. We further investigate the pre-training masked language modeling task with Segatron. Experimental results show that BERT pre-trained with Segatron (SegaBERT) can outperform BERT with vanilla Transformer on various NLP tasks, and outperforms RoBERTa on zero-shot sentence representation learning. Our code is available on GitHub."}

However, the generalizability of graph recategorization in an out-of-distribution setting is unclear. In contrast, state-of-the-art AMR-to-Text generation, which can be seen as the inverse to parsing, is based on simpler seq2seq. In this paper, we cast Text-to-AMR and AMR-to-Text as a symmetric transduction task and show that by devising a careful graph linearization and extending a pretrained encoder-decoder model, it is possible to obtain state-of-the-art performances in both tasks using the very same seq2seq approach, i.e., SPRING (Symmetric PaRsIng aNd Generation). Our model does not require complex pipelines, nor heuristics built on heavy assumptions. In fact, we drop the need for graph recategorization, showing that this technique is actually harmful outside of the standard benchmark. Finally, we outperform the previous state of the art on the English AMR 2.0 dataset by a large margin: on Text-to-AMR we obtain an improvement of 3.6 Smatch points, while on AMR-to-Text we outperform the state of the art by 11.2 BLEU points.

It is the vital step to support many downstream applications, such as knowledge base construction, question answering, document comprehension and so on. Previous studies ignore the semantics of the given keys by considering them only as the class labels, and thus might be incapable to handle zero-shot keys. Meanwhile, although these models often leverage the attention mechanism, the learned features might not reflect the true proxy of explanations on why humans would recognize the value for the key, and thus could not well generalize to new documents. To address these issues, we propose a Key-Aware and Trigger-Aware (KATA) extraction model. With the input key, it explicitly learns two mappings, namely from key representations to trigger representations and then from trigger representations to values. These two mappings might be intrinsic and invariant across different keys and documents. With a large training set automatically constructed based on the Wikipedia data, we pre-train these two mappings. Experiments with the fine-tuning step to two applications show that the proposed model achieves more than 70% accuracy for the extraction of zero-shot keys while previous methods all fail."}

However, it is essential to fully grasp the dialog context to generate a reasonable response. Hence, in this paper, we propose to improve the response generation performance by examining the model's ability to answer a reading comprehension question, where the question is focused on the omitted information in the dialog. Enlightened by the multi-task learning scheme, we propose a joint framework that unifies these two tasks, sharing the same encoder to extract the common and task-invariant features with different decoders to learn task-specific features. To better fusing information from the question and the dialog history in the encoding part, we propose to augment the Transformer architecture with a memory updater, which is designed to selectively store and update the history dialog information so as to support downstream tasks. For the experiment, we employ human annotators to write and examine a large-scale dialog reading comprehension dataset. Extensive experiments are conducted on this dataset, and the results show that the proposed model brings substantial improvements over several strong baselines on both tasks. In this way, we demonstrate that reasoning can indeed help better response generation and vice versa. We release our large-scale dataset for further research."}

However, GCNs struggle to model words with long-range dependencies or are not directly connected in the dependency tree. To address these challenges, we propose to utilize the self-attention mechanism where we explicitly fuse structural information to learn the dependencies between words with different syntactic distances. We introduce GATE, a Graph Attention Transformer Encoder, and test its cross-lingual transferability on relation and event extraction tasks. We perform experiments on the ACE05 dataset that includes three typologically different languages: English, Chinese, and Arabic. The evaluation results show that GATE outperforms three recently proposed methods by a large margin. Our detailed analysis reveals that due to the reliance on syntactic dependencies, GATE produces robust representations that facilitate transfer across languages."}

One form of explanation for a prediction is an extractive rationale, i.e., a subset of features of an instance that lead the model to give its prediction on the instance. Previous works on generating extractive rationales usually employ a two-phase model: a selector that selects the most important features (i.e., the rationale) followed by a predictor that makes the prediction based exclusively on the selected features. One disadvantage of these works is that the main signal for learning to select features comes from the comparison of the final answers given by the predictor and the ground-truth answers. In this work, we propose to squeeze more information from the predictor via an information calibration method. More precisely, we train two models jointly: one is a typical neural model that solves the task at hand in an accurate but black-box manner, and the other is a selector-predictor model that additionally produces a rationale for its prediction. The first model is used as a guide to the second model. We use an adversarial-based technique to calibrate the information extracted by the two models such that the difference between them is an indicator of the missed or over-selected features. In addition, for natural language tasks, we propose to use a language-model-based regularizer to encourage the extraction of fluent rationales. Experimental results on a sentiment analysis task as well as on three tasks from the legal domain show the effectiveness of our approach to rationale extraction."}

Unlike regular documents, conversational utterances appear alternately from different parties and are usually organized as hierarchical structures in previous work. Such structures are not conducive to the application of pre-trained language models such as XLNet. To address this issue, we propose an all-in-one XLNet model, namely DialogXL, with enhanced memory to store longer historical context and dialog-aware self-attention to deal with the multi-party structures. Specifically, we first modify the recurrence mechanism of XLNet from segment-level to utterance-level in order to better model the conversational data. Second, we introduce dialog-aware self-attention in replacement of the vanilla self-attention in XLNet to capture useful intra- and inter-speaker dependencies. Extensive experiments are conducted on four ERC benchmarks with mainstream models presented for comparison. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines on all the datasets. Several other experiments such as ablation study and error analysis are also conducted and the results confirm the role of the critical modules of DialogXL."}

In automatic song writing, lyric-to-melody generation and melody-to-lyric generation are two important tasks, both of which usually suffer from the following challenges: 1) the paired lyric and melody data are limited, which affects the generation quality of the two tasks, considering a lot of paired training data are needed due to the weak correlation between lyric and melody; 2) Strict alignments are required between lyric and melody, which relies on specific alignment modeling. In this paper, we propose SongMASS to address the above challenges, which leverages masked sequence to sequence (MASS) pre-training and attention based alignment modeling for lyric-to-melody and melody-to-lyric generation. Specifically, 1) we extend the original sentence-level MASS pre-training to song level to better capture long contextual information in music, and use a separate encoder and decoder for each modality (lyric or melody);  2) we leverage sentence-level attention mask and token-level attention constraint during training to enhance the alignment between lyric and melody. During inference, we use a dynamic programming strategy to obtain the alignment between each word/syllable in lyric and note in melody. We pre-train SongMASS on unpaired lyric and melody datasets, and both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that SongMASS generates lyric and melody with significantly better quality than the baseline method."}

Proposed models that are evaluated using this dataset consistently set new state-of-the-art performance. However, they still exhibit large error rates despite leveraging external knowledge and unsupervised pretraining on large text corpora. A recent study suggested that this may be due to poor dataset quality. The study observed that over 50% of the most challenging sentences from the development and test sets are incorrectly labeled and account for an average drop of 8% f1-score in model performance. However, this study was limited to a small biased sample of 5k (out of a total of 106k) sentences, substantially restricting the generalizability and broader implications of its findings. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by: (i) performing a comprehensive study over the whole TACRED dataset, (ii) proposing an improved crowdsourcing strategy and deploying it to re-annotate the whole dataset, and (iii) performing a thorough analysis to understand how correcting the TACRED annotations affects previously published results. After verification, we observed that 23.9% of TACRED labels are incorrect. Moreover, evaluating several models on our revised dataset yields an average f1-score improvement of 14.3% and helps uncover significant relationships between the different models (rather than simply offsetting or scaling their scores by a constant factor). Finally, aside from our analysis we also release Re-TACRED, a new completely re-annotated version of the TACRED dataset that can be used to perform reliable evaluation of relation extraction models."}

Practically, the irrelevant text-image pairs account for a large proportion in tweets. The visual clues that are unrelated to the texts will exert uncertain or even negative effects on multimodal model learning.

Especially for Chinese, its ideographic writing system allows radicals to trigger semantic association without the need of phonetics. In fact, subconsciously using the associative information guided by radicals is a key for readers to ensure the robustness of semantic understanding. Fortunately, many basic and extended concepts related to radicals are systematically included in Chinese language dictionaries, which leaves a handy but unexplored way for improving Chinese text representation and classification. To this end, we draw inspirations from cognitive principles between ideography and human associative behavior to propose a novel Radical-guided Associative Model (RAM) for Chinese text classification. RAM comprises two coupled spaces, namely Literal Space and Associative Space, which imitates the real process in people's mind when understanding a Chinese text. To be specific, we first devise a serialized modeling structure in Literal Space to thoroughly capture the sequential information of Chinese text. Then, based on the authoritative information provided by Chinese language dictionaries, we design an association module and put forward a strategy called Radical-Word Association to use ideographic radicals as the medium to associate prior concept words in Associative Space. Afterwards, we design an attention module to imitate people's matching and decision between Literal Space and Associative Space, which can balance the importance of each associative words under specific contexts. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets prove the effectiveness and rationality of RAM, with good cognitive insights for future language modeling."}

Existing methods are mainly designed to incorporate descriptions or conversation histories. Those methods can hardly model speakers with so few conversations or connections between speakers. To better cater for newcomers with few resources, we propose a personalized conversation model (PCM) that learns to adapt to new speakers as well as enabling new speakers to learn from resource-rich speakers. Particularly, based on a meta-learning based PCM, we propose a task aggregator (TA) to collect other speakers' information from the social network. The TA provides prior knowledge of the new speaker in its meta-learning. Experimental results show our methods outperform all baselines in appropriateness, diversity, and consistency with speakers."}

Existing methods for SRE consider extracting social relation only from unimodal information such as text or image, ignoring the high coupling of multimodal information. Moreover, previous studies overlook the serious unbalance distribution on social relations. To address these issues, this paper proposes FL-MSRE, a few-shot learning based approach to extracting social relations from both texts and face images. Considering the lack of multimodal social relation datasets, this paper also presents three multimodal datasets annotated from four classical masterpieces and corresponding TV series. Inspired by the success of BERT, we propose a strong BERT based baseline to extract social relation from text only. FL-MSRE is empirically shown to outperform the baseline significantly. This demonstrates that using face images benefits text-based SRE. Further experiments also show that using two faces from different images achieves similar performance as from the same image. This means that FL-MSRE is suitable for a wide range of SRE applications where the faces of two people can only be collected from different images."}

The accurate prediction of lexical relations between concepts is challenging, due to the sparsity of patterns indicating the existence of such relations. We propose the Knowledge-Enriched Meta-Learning (KEML) framework to address lexical relation classification. In KEML, the LKB-BERT (Lexical Knowledge Base-BERT) model is first presented to learn concept representations from text corpora, with rich lexical knowledge injected by distant supervision. A probabilistic distribution of auxiliary tasks is defined to increase the model's ability to recognize different types of lexical relations. We further propose a neural classifier integrated with special relation recognition cells, in order to combine meta-learning over the auxiliary task distribution and supervised learning for LRC. Experiments over multiple datasets show KEML outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

Different methods have been proposed to classify the role of each attention head based on the relations between tokens which have high pair-wise attention. These roles include syntactic (tokens with some syntactic relation), local (nearby tokens), block (tokens in the same sentence) and delimiter (the special [CLS], [SEP] tokens). There are two main challenges with existing methods for classification: (a) there  are no standard scores across studies or across functional roles, and (b) these scores are often average quantities measured across sentences without capturing statistical significance. In this work, we formalize a simple yet effective score that generalizes to all the roles of attention heads and employs hypothesis testing on this score for robust inference. This provides us the right lens to systematically analyze attention heads and confidently comment on many commonly posed questions on analyzing the BERT model. In particular, we comment on the co-location of multiple functional roles in the same attention head, the distribution of attention heads across layers, and effect of fine-tuning for specific NLP tasks on these functional roles.

The fast development of new approaches has been further encouraged by a well-framed evaluation suite for English, which has allowed their performances to be kept track of and compared fairly. However, other languages have remained largely unexplored, as testing data are available for a few languages only and the evaluation setting is rather matted. In this paper, we untangle this situation by proposing XL-WSD, a cross-lingual evaluation benchmark for the WSD task featuring sense-annotated development and test sets in 18 languages from six different linguistic families, together with language-specific silver training data. We leverage XL-WSD datasets to conduct an extensive evaluation of neural and knowledge-based approaches, including the most recent multilingual language models.  Results show that the zero-shot knowledge transfer across languages is a promising research direction within the WSD field, especially when considering low-resourced languages where large pre-trained multilingual models still perform poorly.

The teacher network is supposed to be a trustworthy predictor and the student tries to mimic its predictions. Usually, a student with a lighter architecture is selected so we can achieve compression and yet deliver high-quality results. In such a setting, distillation only happens for final predictions whereas the student could also benefit from teacher’s supervision for internal components.  Motivated by this, we studied the problem of distillation for intermediate layers. Since there might not be a one-to-one alignment between student and teacher layers, existing techniques skip some teacher layers and only distill from a subset of them. This shortcoming directly impacts quality, so we instead propose a combinatorial technique which relies on attention. Our model fuses teacher-side information and takes each layer’s significance into consideration, then it performs distillation between combined teacher layers and those of the student. Using our technique, we distilled a 12-layer BERT (Devlin et al. 2019) into 6-, 4-, and 2-layer counterparts and evaluated them on GLUE tasks (Wang et al. 2018). Experimental results show that our combinatorial approach is able to outperform other existing techniques."}

The dialog context information (contextual information) and the mutual interaction information are two key factors that contribute to the two related tasks. Unfortunately, none of the existing approaches consider the two important sources of information simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a Co-Interactive Graph Attention Network (Co-GAT) to jointly perform the two tasks. The core module is a proposed co-interactive graph interaction layer where a cross-utterances connection and a cross-tasks connection are constructed and iteratively updated with each other, achieving to consider the two types of information simultaneously. Experimental results on two public datasets show that our model successfully captures the two sources of information and achieve the state-of-the-art performance. In addition, we find that the contributions from the contextual and mutual interaction information do not fully overlap with contextualized word representations (BERT, Roberta, XLNet)."}

However, as radically empirical models on sentences, they are subject to the input data distribution, inevitably incorporating data bias and reporting bias, which may lead to inaccurate understanding of sentences. To address this problem, we propose to adopt a human learner's approach: when we cannot make sense of a word in a sentence, we often consult the dictionary for specific meanings; but can the same work for empirical models? In this work, we try to inform the pre-trained masked language models of word meanings for semantics-enhanced pre-training. To achieve a contrastive and holistic view of word meanings, a definition pair of two related words is presented to the masked language model such that the model can better associate a word with its crucial semantic features. Both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations validate the proposed approach on semantics-orientated tasks, with an almost negligible increase of training data."}

However, most of the existing NER benchmarks lack domain-specialized entity types or do not focus on a certain domain, leading to a less effective cross-domain evaluation. To address these obstacles, we introduce a cross-domain NER dataset (CrossNER), a fully-labeled collection of NER data spanning over five diverse domains with specialized entity categories for different domains. Additionally, we also provide a domain-related corpus since using it to continue pre-training language models (domain-adaptive pre-training) is effective for the domain adaptation. We then conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the effectiveness of leveraging different levels of the domain corpus and pre-training strategies to do domain-adaptive pre-training for the cross-domain task. Results show that focusing on the fractional corpus containing domain-specialized entities and utilizing a more challenging pre-training strategy in domain-adaptive pre-training are beneficial for the NER domain adaptation, and our proposed method can consistently outperform existing cross-domain NER baselines. Nevertheless, experiments also illustrate the challenge of this cross-domain NER task. We hope that our dataset and baselines will catalyze research in the NER domain adaptation area.

Motivated by descriptive ethics, a field of study that focuses on people's descriptive judgments rather than theoretical prescriptions on morality, we investigate a novel, data-driven approach to machine ethics.  We introduce SCRUPLES, the first large-scale dataset with 625,000 ethical judgments over 32,000 real-life anecdotes. Each anecdote recounts a complex ethical situation, often posing moral dilemmas, paired with a distribution of judgments contributed by the community members. Our dataset presents a major challenge to state-of-the-art neural language models, leaving significant room for improvement. However, when presented with simplified moral situations, the results are considerably more promising, suggesting that neural models can effectively learn simpler ethical building blocks.  A key take-away of our empirical analysis is that norms are not always clean-cut; many situations are naturally divisive. We present a new method to estimate the best possible performance on such tasks with inherently diverse label distributions, and explore likelihood functions that separate intrinsic from model uncertainty.

Now, research interest has sharply increased with an influx of new benchmarks and models.  We propose two new ways to evaluate commonsense models, emphasizing their generality on new tasks and building on diverse, recently introduced benchmarks. First, we propose a new multitask benchmark, Rainbow, to promote research on commonsense models that generalize well over multiple tasks and datasets. Second, we propose a novel evaluation, the cost equivalent curve, that sheds new insight on how the choice of source datasets, pretrained language models, and transfer learning methods impacts performance and data efficiency.  We perform extensive experiments---over 200 experiments encompassing 4800 models---and report multiple valuable and sometimes surprising findings, e.g., that transfer almost always leads to better or equivalent performance if following a particular recipe, that QA-based commonsense datasets transfer well with each other, while commonsense knowledge graphs do not, and that perhaps counter-intuitively, larger models benefit more from transfer than smaller ones.  Last but not least, we introduce a new universal commonsense reasoning model, UNICORN, that establishes new state-of-the-art performance across 8 popular commonsense benchmarks, aNLI (87.3%), CosmosQA (91.8%), HellaSWAG (93.9%), PIQA (90.1%), SocialIQa (83.2%), WinoGrande (86.6%), CycIC (94.0%) and CommonsenseQA (79.3%)."}

Here we introduce HowNet as an external knowledge base and propose a Linguistic knowledge Enhanced graph Transformer (LET) to deal with word ambiguity. Additionally, we adopt the word lattice graph as input to maintain multi-granularity information. Our model is also complementary to pre-trained language models. Experimental results on two Chinese datasets show that our models outperform various typical text matching approaches.

Our main contributions include a) We introduce GYC, a framework to generate counterfactual samples such that the generation is plausible, diverse, goal-oriented, and effective, b) We generate counterfactual samples, that can direct the generation towards a corresponding texttt{condition} such as named-entity tag, semantic role label, or sentiment. Our experimental results on various domains show that GYC generates counterfactual text samples exhibiting the above four properties.

A hitherto unexplored facet of model performance is: Are our leaderboards doing equitable evaluation? In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic method to probe leaderboards by weighting samples based on their 'difficulty' level. We find that leaderboards can be adversarially attacked and top performing models may not always be the best models. We subsequently propose alternate evaluation metrics. Our experiments on 10 models show changes in model ranking and an overall reduction in previously reported performance- thus rectifying the overestimation of AI systems' capabilities. Inspired by behavioral testing principles, we further develop a prototype of a visual analytics tool that enables leaderboard revamping through customization, based on an end user's focus area. This helps users analyze models' strengths and weaknesses, and guides them in the selection of a model best suited for their application scenario. In a user study, members of various commercial product development teams, covering 5 focus areas, find that our prototype reduces pre-deployment development and testing effort by 41% on average."}

However, the reliability of the fine-tuned text classifiers is an often underlooked performance criterion. For instance, one may desire a model that can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples (drawn far from training distribution) or be robust against domain shifts. We claim that one central obstacle to the reliability is the over-reliance of the model on a limited number of keywords, instead of looking at the whole context. In particular, we find that (a) OOD samples often contain in-distribution keywords, while (b) cross-domain samples may not always contain keywords; over-relying on the keywords can be problematic for both cases. In light of this observation, we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning method, coined masked keyword regularization (MASKER), that facilitates context-based prediction. MASKER regularizes the model to reconstruct the keywords from the rest of the words and make low-confidence predictions without enough context. When applied to various pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT), we demonstrate that MASKER improves OOD detection and cross-domain generalization without degrading classification accuracy.

Producers can obtain more traffic and profits, and readers can have access to outstanding articles. When generating attractive headlines, it is important to not only capture the attractive content but also follow an eye-catching writtenstyle. In this paper, we propose a Disentanglement-based Attractive Headline Generator (DAHG) that generates headline which captures the attractive content following the attractive style. Concretely, we first devise a disentanglement module to divide the style and content of an attractive prototype headline into latent spaces, with two auxiliary constraints to ensure the two spaces are indeed disentangled. The latent content information is then used to further polish the document representation and help capture the salient part. Finally, the generator takes the polished document as input to generate headline under the guidance of the attractive style.  Extensive experiments on the public Kuaibao dataset show that DAHG achieves state-of-the-art performance.  Human evaluation also demonstrates that DAHG triggers 22% more clicks than existing models."}

In this paper, we introduce an Attentive Convolutional Transformer (ACT) that takes the advantages of both Transformer and CNN for efficient text classification. Specifically, we propose a novel attentive convolution mechanism that utilizes the semantic meaning of convolutional filters attentively to transform text from complex word space to a more informative convolutional filter space where important n-grams are captured. ACT is able to capture both local and global dependencies effectively while preserving sequential information. Experiments on various text classification tasks and detailed analyses show that ACT is a lightweight, fast, and effective universal text classifier, outperforming CNNs, RNNs, and attentive models including Transformer."}

In this paper, we propose a new retrieval target, hop, to collect the hidden reasoning evidence from Wikipedia for complex question answering. Specifically, the hop in this paper is defined as the combination of a hyperlink and the corresponding outbound link document. The hyperlink is encoded as the mention embedding which models the structured knowledge of how the outbound link entity is mentioned in the textual context, and the corresponding outbound link document is encoded as the document embedding representing the unstructured knowledge within it. Accordingly, we build HopRetriever which retrieves hops over Wikipedia to answer complex questions.

AI applications of TSQA such as answering multiple-choice questions in high-school exams require synthesizing data in multiple cells and combining tables with texts and domain knowledge to infer answers. To support the study of this task, we construct GeoTSQA. This dataset contains 1k real questions contextualized by tabular scenarios in the geography domain. To solve the task, we extend state-of-the-art MRC methods with TTGen, a novel table-to-text generator. It generates sentences from variously synthesized tabular data and feeds the downstream MRC method with the most useful sentences. Its sentence ranking model fuses the information in the scenario, question, and domain knowledge. Our approach outperforms a variety of strong baseline methods on GeoTSQA."}

NLEs have been shown to capture human reasoning better, but not as beneficial for natural language inference (NLI). In this paper, we analyze two primary flaws in the way NLEs are currently used to train explanation generators for language inference tasks. We find that the explanation generators do not take into account the variability inherent in human explanation of labels, and that the current explanation generation models generate spurious explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework, LIREx, that incorporates both a rationale-enabled explanation generator and an instance selector to select only relevant, plausible NLEs to augment NLI models. When evaluated on the standardized SNLI data set, LIREx achieved an accuracy of 91.87%, an improvement of 0.32 over the baseline and matching the best-reported performance on the data set. It also achieves significantly better performance than previous studies when transferred to the out-of-domain MultiNLI data set. Qualitative analysis shows that LIREx generates flexible, faithful, and relevant NLEs that allow the model to be more robust to spurious explanations.

Endowing agents with rationality and emotion has been one of the major milestones in AI. However, in the field of conversational AI, most existing models only specialize in one aspect and neglect the other, which often leads to dull or unrelated responses. In this paper, we hypothesize that combining rationality and emotion into conversational agents can improve response quality. To test the hypothesis, we focus on one fundamental aspect of rationality, i.e., commonsense, and propose CARE, a novel model for commonsense-aware emotional response generation. Specifically, we first propose a framework to learn and construct commonsense-aware emotional latent concepts of the response given an input message and a desired emotion. We then propose three methods to collaboratively incorporate the latent concepts into response generation. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets support our hypothesis and show that our model can produce more accurate and commonsense-aware emotional responses and achieve better human ratings than state-of-the-art models that only specialize in one aspect."}

Existing methods utilize active learning to reduce costs in corpus annotation, as well as the multi-task learning strategy to model the correlations between different tasks. However, existing models do not take task-specific features for different tasks and diversity of query samples into account. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-task adversarial active learning model for medical named entity recognition and normalization. In our model, the adversarial learning keeps the effectiveness of multi-task learning module and active learning module. The task discriminator eliminates the influence of irregular task-specific features. And the diversity discriminator exploits the heterogeneity between samples to meet the diversity constraint.

This poses severe risks to security-critical tasks such as sentiment analysis and peer-reviewer assignment that are based on LDA. In this paper, we are interested in knowing whether LDA models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of benign document examples during inference time. We formalize the evasion attack to LDA models as an optimization problem and prove it to be NP-hard. We then propose a novel and efficient algorithm, EvaLDA to solve it. We show the effectiveness of EvaLDA via extensive empirical evaluations. For instance, in the NIPS dataset, EvaLDA can averagely promote the rank of a target topic from 10 to around 7 by only replacing 1% of the words with similar words in a victim document. Our work provides significant insights into the power and limitations of evasion attacks to LDA models."}

The isotropy of the pre-trained embeddings in PTLMs, however, is relatively under-explored. In this paper, we analyze the isotropy of the pre-trained [CLS] embeddings of PTLMs with straightforward visualization, and point out two major issues: high variance in their standard deviation, and high correlation between different dimensions. We also propose a new network regularization method, isotropic batch normalization (IsoBN) to address the issues, towards learning more isotropic representations in fine-tuning by dynamically penalizing dominating principal components.

We solve the issues in existing studies under low-resource situations from two sides. From the perspective of the model, the existing methods always suffer from the concern of insufficient parameter sharing and do not consider the semantics of roles, which is not conducive to dealing with sparse data.  And from the perspective of the data, most existing methods focus on data generation and data augmentation.  However, these methods rely heavily on external resources, which is more laborious to create than obtain unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose DualQA, a novel framework, which models the event argument extraction task as question answering to alleviate the problem of data sparseness and leverage the duality of event argument recognition which is to ask \"What plays the role\", as well as event role recognition which is to ask \"What the role is\",  to mutually improve each other.Experimental results on two datasets prove the effectiveness of our approach, especially in extremely low-resource situations."}

In this paper, we develop a translation system for unwritten languages, named as UWSpeech, which converts target unwritten speech into discrete tokens with a converter, and then translates source-language speech into target discrete tokens with a translator, and finally synthesizes target speech from target discrete tokens with an inverter. We propose a method called XL-VAE, which enhances vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) with cross-lingual (XL) speech recognition, to train the converter and inverter of UWSpeech jointly.

For  this,  a  Tacotron  2 TTS model is first trained, and then the parameters of its decoder are transferred to the TaLNet decoder. We have evaluated our approach on an unconstrained multi-speaker voice recovery task. Our results show the effectiveness of both the proposed  model  and  the  transfer  learning  strategy.  Speech reconstructed  using  our  proposed  method  significantly  outperformed all baselines (DNN, BLSTM and without transfer learning) in terms of both naturalness and intelligibility. When using an ASR model decoding the recovery speech, the WER of our proposed method is relatively reduced over 30% compared to baselines."}

Recently, deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance in this area, especially BERT. Despite the effectiveness of these models, most of them treat output labels as meaningless one-hot vectors, underestimating the semantic information and guidance of relations that these labels reveal, especially for  tasks with a small number of labels. To address this problem, we propose a Relation of Relation Learning Network (R2-Net) for sentence semantic matching. Specifically, we first employ BERT to encode the input sentences from a global perspective. Then a CNN-based encoder is designed to capture keywords and phrase information from a local perspective. To fully leverage labels for better relation information extraction, we introduce a self-supervised relation of relation classification task for guiding R2-Net to consider more about labels. Meanwhile, a triplet loss is employed to distinguish the intra-class and inter-class relations in a finer granularity. Empirical experiments on two sentence semantic matching tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model. As a byproduct, we have released the codes to facilitate other researches."}

It is however still challenging to learn the subtle semantic differences between events based solely on textual descriptions of events often represented as (subject, predicate, object) triples. As an alternative, images offer a more intuitive way of understanding event semantics. We observe that event described in text and in images show different abstraction levels and therefore should be projected onto heterogeneous embedding spaces, as opposed to what have been done in previous approaches which project signals from different modalities onto a homogeneous space. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Event Representation Learning framework (MERL) to learn event representations based on both text and image modalities simultaneously. Event textual triples are projected as Gaussian density embeddings by a dual-path Gaussian triple encoder, while event images are projected as point embeddings by a visual event component-aware image encoder. Moreover, a novel score function motivated by statistical hypothesis testing is introduced to coordinate two embedding spaces. Experiments are conducted on various multimodal event-related tasks and results show that MERL outperforms a number of unimodal and multimodal baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework."}

A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nyströmformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nyström method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nyströmformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nyströmformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nyströmformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Specifically, we design two alternative transformation modules inside each self-attention building block to produce attentive biases so as to adaptively regularize its attention flow. Our experiments demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed entity structure and the effectiveness of SSAN. It significantly outperforms competitive baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art results on three popular document-level relation extraction datasets. We further provide ablation and visualization to show how the entity structure guides the model for better relation extraction. Our code is publicly available."}

When the given text is long, it is challenging to identify indicative words for the relation prediction. Recent advances on RE task are from BERT-based sequence modeling and graph-based modeling of relationships among the tokens in the sequence. In this paper, we propose to construct a latent multi-view graph to capture various possible relationships among tokens. We then refine this graph to select important words for relation prediction. Finally, the representation of the refined graph and the BERT-based sequence representation are concatenated for relation extraction. Specifically, in our proposed GDPNet (Gaussian Dynamic Time Warping Pooling Net), we utilize Gaussian Graph Generator (GGG) to generate edges of the multi-view graph. The graph is then refined by Dynamic Time Warping Pooling (DTWPool). On DialogRE and TACRED, we show that GDPNet achieves the best performance on dialogue-level RE, and comparable performance with the state-of-the-arts on sentence-level RE.

In recent years a lot of methods to measure the semantic similarity of two short texts were developed. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis for more than a dozen of such methods. Using a new dataset of fourteen thousand sentence pairs human-labeled according to their semantic similarity, we demonstrate that none of the metrics widely used in the literature is close enough to human judgment in these tasks. A number of recently proposed metrics provide comparable results, yet Word Mover Distance is shown to be the most reasonable solution to measure semantic similarity in reformulated texts at the moment."}

Specifically, UBAR is acquired by fine-tuning the large pre-trained unidirectional language model GPT-2 on the sequence of the entire dialog session which is composed of user utterance, belief state, database result, system act, and system response of every dialog turn. Additionally, UBAR is evaluated in a more realistic setting, where its dialog context has access to user utterances and all content it generated such as belief states, system acts, and system responses. Experimental results on the MultiWOZ datasets show that UBAR achieves state-of-the-art performances in multiple settings, improving the combined score of response generation, policy optimization, and end-to-end modeling by 4.7, 3.5, and 9.4 points respectively. Thorough analyses demonstrate that the session-level training sequence formulation and the generated dialog context are essential for UBAR to operate as a fully end-to-end task-oriented dialog system in real life.  We also examine the transfer ability of UBAR to new domains with limited data and provide visualization and a case study to illustrate the advantages of UBAR in modeling on a dialog session level."}

Here we study using such LMs to fill in entities in human-authored comparative questions, like ``Which country is older, India or _____?''---i.e., we study the ability of neural LMs to ask (not answer) reasonable questions.  We show that accuracy in this fill-in-the-blank task is well-correlated with human judgements of whether a question is reasonable, and that these models can be trained to achieve nearly human-level performance in completing comparative questions in three different subdomains. However, analysis shows that what they learn fails to model any sort of broad notion of which entities are semantically comparable or similar---instead the trained models are very domain-specific, and performance is highly correlated with co-occurrences between specific entities observed in the training set.  This is true both for models that are pretrained on general text corpora, as well as models trained on a large corpus of comparison questions. Our study thus reinforces recent results on the difficulty of making claims about a deep model's world knowledge or linguistic competence based on performance on specific benchmark problems. We make our evaluation datasets publicly available to foster future research on complex understanding and reasoning in such models at standards of human interaction."}

It firstly learns two separate spaces of speaker-knowledge and speech-stimuli based on a shared feature space, where a new block structure is designed as the building block for all spaces, and then cooperatively solves different tasks. Between the two spaces, information is cast towards each other via a novel cross- and dual-attention mechanism, mimicking the bottom-up and top-down processes of a human's cocktail party effect. It turns out that substantially discriminative and generalizable speaker representations can be learnt in severely interfered conditions via our self-supervised training. The experimental results verify this seeming paradox. The learnt speaker embedding has superior discriminative power than a standard speaker verification method; meanwhile, Tune-In achieves remarkably better speech separation performances in terms of SI-SNRi and SDRi consistently in all test modes, and especially at lower memory and computational consumption, than state-of-the-art benchmark systems."}

To address this problem, we propose a counterfactual domain adaptation method to better leverage both large-scale source-domain data (formal texts)  and small-scale target-domain data (informal texts). Specifically, by considering effective counterfactual conditions (the concatenations of source-domain texts and the target-domain tag), we construct the counterfactual representations to fill the sparse latent space of the target domain caused by a small amount of data, that is, bridging the gap between the source-domain data and the target-domain data. Experiments on English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English translation tasks show that our method outperforms the base model that is trained only on the informal corpus by a large margin, and consistently surpasses different baseline methods by +1.12 ~ 4.34 BLEU points on different datasets. Furthermore, we also show that our method achieves competitive performances on cross-domain language translation on four language pairs."}

We suspect previous text GANs' inferior performance is due to the lack of a reliable guiding signal in their discriminators. To address this problem, we propose a generative adversarial imitation learning framework for text generation that uses large pre-trained language models to provide more reliable reward guidance. As previous text GANs suffer from high variance of gradients, we apply contrastive discriminator, and proximal policy optimization (PPO) to stabilize and improve text generation performance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on a diverse set of unconditional and conditional text generation tasks. Experimental results show that TextGAIL achieves better performance in terms of both quality and diversity than the MLE baseline. We also validate our intuition that TextGAIL's discriminator demonstrates the capability of providing reasonable rewards with an additional task."}

Currently, state-of-the-art approaches use privacy-preserving generative adversarial networks (PP-GANs) for this purpose, for instance, to enable reliable facial expression recognition without leaking users' identity. However, PP-GANs do not offer formal proofs of privacy and instead rely on experimentally measuring information leakage using classification accuracy on the sensitive attributes of deep learning (DL)-based discriminators. In this work, we question the rigor of such checks by subverting existing privacy-preserving GANs for facial expression recognition. We show that it is possible to hide the sensitive identification data in the sanitized output images of such PP-GANs for later extraction, which can even allow for reconstruction of the entire input images, while satisfying privacy checks. We demonstrate our approach via a PP-GAN-based architecture and provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations using two public datasets. Our experimental results raise fundamental questions about the need for more rigorous privacy checks of PP-GANs, and we provide insights into the social impact of these."}

Each post in our dataset is annotated from three different perspectives: the basic, commonly used 3-class classification (i.e., hate, offensive or normal), the target community (i.e., the community that has been the victim of hate speech/offensive speech in the post), and the rationales, i.e., the portions of the post on which their labelling decision (as hate, offensive or normal) is based. We utilize existing state-of-the-art models and observe that even models that perform very well in classification do not score high on explainability metrics like model plausibility and faithfulness. We also observe that models, which utilize the human rationales for training, perform better in reducing unintended bias towards target communities.

Deployment, however, needs compliance with stringent privacy regulations. Training algorithms that preserve the privacy of training data are in pressing need.   Purely cryptographic approaches can protect privacy, but they are still costly, even when they rely on two or more non-colluding servers. Seemingly-\"trivial\" operations in plaintext quickly become prohibitively inefficient when a series of them are \"crypto-processed,\" e.g., (dynamic) quantization for ensuring the intermediate values would not overflow.   Slalom, recently proposed by Tramer and Boneh, is the first solution that leverages both GPU (for efficient batch computation) and a trusted execution environment (TEE) (for minimizing the use of cryptography). Roughly, it works by a lot of pre-computation over known and fixed weights, and hence it only supports private inference. Five related problems for private training are left unaddressed.   Goten, our privacy-preserving training and prediction framework, tackles all five problems simultaneously via our careful design over the \"mismatched\" cryptographic and GPU data types (due to the tension between precision and efficiency) and our round-optimal GPU-outsourcing protocol (hence minimizing the communication cost between servers). It 1) stochastically trains a low-bitwidth yet accurate model, 2) supports dynamic quantization (a challenge left by Slalom), 3) minimizes the memory-swapping overhead of the memory-limited TEE and its communication with GPU, 4) crypto-protects the (dynamic) model weight from untrusted GPU, and 5) outperforms a pure-TEE system, even without pre-computation (needed by Slalom). As a baseline, we build CaffeScone that secures Caffe using TEE but not GPU; Goten shows a 6.84x speed-up of the whole VGG-11. Goten also outperforms Falcon proposed by Wagh et al., the latest secure multi-server cryptographic solution, by 132.64x using VGG-11. Lastly, we demonstrate Goten's efficacy in training models for breast cancer diagnosis over sensitive images."}

Although next-item and next-basket recommendation has been a focus of prior research, multiple consecutive item or basket approaches are needed for planning. No prior work has leveraged pre-specified future reference items to improve this type of challenging consecutive prediction task at inference time. PLAN-BERT is the first to accommodate this general planning scenario. It does so by contributing novel modifications that take inspiration from the masked training and contextual embedding of self-attention models. To test the model, we use the domain of student academic degree planning, in which students’ past course histories and future pre-specified courses of interest are used to fill in the remainder of their curriculum. Our offline analyses consist of 15 million historic course enrollments at 20 institutions and an online evaluation conducted at one of the institutions. Our results show that PLAN-BERT outperforms existing models including BERT, BiLSTM, and a UserKNN baseline, with small numbers of future reference items substantially improving accuracy.

Defenders must choose how much time to spend in each region of the protected area, balancing exploration of infrequently visited regions and exploitation of known hotspots. We formulate the problem as a stochastic multi-armed bandit, where each action represents a patrol strategy, enabling us to guarantee the rate of convergence of the patrolling policy. However, a naive bandit approach would compromise short-term performance for long-term optimality, resulting in animals poached and forests destroyed. To speed up performance, we leverage smoothness in the reward function and decomposability of actions. We show a synergy between Lipschitz-continuity and decomposition as each aids the convergence of the other. In doing so, we bridge the gap between combinatorial and Lipschitz bandits, presenting a no-regret approach that tightens existing guarantees while optimizing for short-term performance. We demonstrate that our algorithm, LIZARD, improves performance on real-world poaching data from Cambodia."}

More specifically, we put forward two complementary feature calculation methods to describe signals and build a new action recognition deep learning network based on those features. Encouraging empirical results on the data collected at a real location confirm that the features can effectively describe signals in an environment with strong noise and weak signals, and the entire approach can identify and locate third-party damage events quickly under various hardware conditions with accuracies of 99.26% (500 Hz) and 97.20% (100 Hz).

A central goal for conservation planning and monitoring is the ability to accurately predict the occurrence of species communities and how these communities change over space and time. This in turn leads to a challenging and long-standing problem in the field of computer science - how to perform accurate multi-label classification with hundreds of labels? The key challenge of this problem is its exponential-sized output space with regards to the number of labels to be predicted. Therefore, it is essential to facilitate the learning process by exploiting correlations (or dependency) among labels. Previous methods mostly focus on modelling the correlation on label pairs; however, complex relations between real-world objects often go beyond second order. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-label classification, High-order Tie-in Variational Autoencoder (HOT-VAE), which performs adaptive high-order label correlation learning. We experimentally verify that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches on a bird distribution dataset on both conventional F1 scores and a variety of ecological metrics.

Naively applying predictions to combinatorial optimization problems can incur high costs, which has motivated researchers to consider learning augmented algorithms that can make use of faulty or incomplete predictions. Inspired by two matching problems in computational sustainability where data is abundant, we consider the learning augmented min weight matching problem where some nodes are revealed online while others are known a priori, e.g., by being predicted by machine learning. We develop an algorithm that is able to make use of this extra information and provably improves upon pessimistic online algorithms. We evaluate our algorithm on two settings from computational sustainability -- the coordination of unreliable citizen scientists for invasive species management, and the matching between taxis and riders under uncertain trip duration predictions. In both cases, we perform extensive experiments on real-world datasets and find that our method outperforms baselines, showing how learning augmented algorithms can reliably improve solutions for problems in computational sustainability."}

As an ongoing collaboration with the New York Natural Heritage Program, we consider the use of unsupervised deep learning techniques for dimensionality reduction of remote sensing images, which can reduce sample complexity for downstream tasks and decreases the need for large labeled data sets. We consider spatially augmenting contrastive learning by training neural networks to correctly classify two nearby patches of a landscape as such. We demonstrate that this approach improves upon previous methods and naive classification for a large-scale data set of remote sensing images derived from invasive species observations obtained over 30 years. Additionally, we simulate deployment in the field via active learning and evaluate this method on another important challenge in computational sustainability -- landcover classification -- and again find that it outperforms previous baselines."}

Yet, those most in need of this technology are often the most underserved by it. In many countries, illiterate people tend to speak only low-resource languages, for which the datasets necessary for speech technology development are scarce.  In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of unsupervised speech representation learning on noisy radio broadcasting archives, which are abundant even in low-resource languages. We make three core contributions. First, we release two datasets to the research community. The first, West African Radio Corpus, contains 142 hours of audio in more than 10 languages with a labeled validation subset. The second, West African Virtual Assistant Speech Recognition Corpus, consists of 10K labeled audio clips in four languages. Next, we share West African wav2vec, a speech encoder trained on the noisy radio corpus, and compare it with the baseline Facebook speech encoder trained on six times more data of higher quality. We show that West African wav2vec performs similarly to the baseline on a multilingual speech recognition task, and significantly outperforms the baseline on a West African language identification task. Finally, we share the first-ever speech recognition models for Maninka, Pular and Susu, languages spoken by a combined 10 million people in over seven countries, including six where the majority of the adult population is illiterate.

Accurate and sensitive analysis of large amounts of mass spectra data is a principal challenge in proteomics. Conventional deep learning-based peptide identification models usually adopt an encoder-decoder framework and generate target sequence from left to right without fully exploiting the global information. A few recent approaches seek to employ two-pass decoding, yet have limitations when facing the spectra filled with noise. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for improved peptide identification, which first retrieves a similar mass spectrum from the database as a reference and then revise the matched sequence according to the difference information between the referenced spectrum and current context. The inspiration of design comes that the retrieved peptide-spectrum pair provides a good start point and indirect access to both past and future information, such that each revised amino acid can be produced with better noise perception and global understanding. Moreover, a disturb-based optimization process is introduced to sharpen the attention for difference vector with reinforcement learning before fed to decoder. Experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate that prominent performance boost is obtained with the proposed method. Remarkably, we achieve new state-of-the-art identification results on these datasets."}

AM problems are planning problems that can be modelled using Mixed Observability MDPs (MOMDPs). MOMDPs tackle decision problems where state variables are completely or partially observable. Unfortunately, MOMDP solutions (policy graphs) are too complex to be interpreted by human decision-makers. Here, we provide algorithms to solve K-N-MOMDPs, where K represents the maximum number of fully observable states and N represents the maximum number of alpha-vectors. Our algorithms calculate compact and more interpretable policy graphs from existing MOMDP models and solutions. We apply these algorithms to two computational sustainability applications: optimal release of bio-control agents to prevent dengue epidemics and conservation of the threatened bird species Gouldian finch. The methods dramatically reduce the number of states and alpha-vectors in MOMDP problems without significantly reducing their quality. The resulting policies have small policy graphs (4-6 nodes) that can be easily interpreted by human decision-makers."}

Existing abusive language detection techniques are particularly ill-suited to comments containing heterogeneous abusive language patterns, i.e., both abusive and non-abusive parts. This is due in part to the lack of datasets that explicitly annotate heterogeneity in abusive language. We tackle this challenge by providing an annotated dataset of abusive language in over 11,000 comments from YouTube. We account for heterogeneity in this dataset by separately annotating both the comment as a whole and the individual sentences that comprise each comment. We then propose an algorithm that uses a supervised attention mechanism to detect and categorize abusive content using multi-task learning. We empirically demonstrate the challenges of using traditional techniques on heterogeneous content and the comparative gains in performance of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods."}

Prior works have shown that using Computer Vision (CV) techniques to identify smoke as visual evidence can influence the attitude of regulators and empower citizens to pursue environmental justice. However, existing datasets are not of sufficient quality nor quantity to train the robust CV models needed to support air quality advocacy. We introduce RISE, the first large-scale video dataset for Recognizing Industrial Smoke Emissions. We adopted a citizen science approach to collaborate with local community members to annotate whether a video clip has smoke emissions. Our dataset contains 12,567 clips from 19 distinct views from cameras that monitored three industrial facilities. These daytime clips span 30 days over two years, including all four seasons. We ran experiments using deep neural networks to establish a strong performance baseline and reveal smoke recognition challenges. Our survey study discussed community feedback, and our data analysis displayed opportunities for integrating citizen scientists and crowd workers into the application of Artificial Intelligence for Social Impact."}

We have developed a recognition method starting from images captured on site, which relies on the shape of the sherd's fracture outline.  The method sets up a new target for deep-learning, integrating  information from points along inner and outer surfaces to learn about shapes.  Training the classifiers required tackling multiple challenges that arose on account of our working with real-world archeological data: paucity of labeled data; extreme imbalance between instances of  different categories; and the need to avoid neglecting rare classes and to take note of minute distinguishing features of some classes.  The scarcity of training data was overcome by using synthetically-produced virtual potsherds and by employing multiple data-augmentation techniques.  A novel form of training loss allowed us to overcome classification problems caused by under-populated classes and inhomogeneous distribution of discriminative features."}

However, they still have some major weaknesses. One key weakness is that they are typically trained from manually-labeled data and/or written with handcrafted rules, and their knowledge bases (KBs) are also compiled by human experts. Due to the huge amount of manual effort involved, they are difficult to scale and also tend to produce many errors ought to their limited ability to understand natural language and the limited knowledge in their KBs. Thus, the level of user satisfactory is often low. In this paper, we propose to dramatically improve the situation by endowing the chatbots the ability to continually learn (1) new world knowledge, (2) new language expressions to ground them to actions, and (3) new conversational skills, during conversation by themselves so that as they chat more and more with users, they become more and more knowledgeable and are better and better able to understand diverse natural language expressions and to improve their conversational skills."}

The database of historical and novel technical drawings thus represents the knowledge that is core to their operations. With current methods, however, utilizing these drawings is mostly a manual and time consuming effort. In this work, we present a software tool that knows how to interpret various parts of the drawing and can translate this information to allow for automatic reasoning and machine  learning  on top of such a large database of technical drawings. For example, to find erroneous designs, to learn about patterns present in successful designs, etc. To achieve this, we propose a method that automatically learns a parser capable of interpreting technical drawings, using only limited expert interaction. The proposed method makes use of both neural methods and symbolic  methods.  Neural methods to interpret visual images and recognize parts of two-dimensional drawings. Symbolic methods to deal with the relational structure and understand the data encapsulated in complex tables present in the technical drawing. Furthermore, the output can be used, for example, to build a similarity based search algorithm. We showcase one deployed tool that is used to help engineers find relevant, previous designs more easily as they can now query the database using a partial design instead of through limited and tedious keyword searches. A partial design can be a part of the two-dimensional  drawing, part of a table,  part of  the  contained textual information, or combinations thereof."}

Unlike many other EaaS tools that focus primarily on fixed sample A/B testing, Comparison Lift deploys a custom bandit-based experimentation algorithm. The advantages of the bandit-based approach are two-fold. First, it aligns the randomization induced in the test with the advertiser’s goals from testing. Second, by adapting experimental design to information acquired during the test, it reduces substantially the cost of experimentation to the advertiser. Since launch in May 2019, Comparison Lift has been utilized in over 1,500 experiments. We estimate that utilization of the product has helped increase click-through rates of participating advertising campaigns by 46% on average. We estimate that the adaptive design in the product has generated 27% more clicks on average during testing compared to a fixed sample A/B design. Both suggest significant value generation and cost savings to advertisers from the product."}

We are strongly positioned to leverage the advancements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) which provide humanity, for the first time in history, an analysis and decision making tool at massive scale. Strong evidence supports that global warming is contributing to marine ecosystem decline, including eelgrass habitat. Eelgrass is affected by an opportunistic marine pathogen and infections are likely exacerbated by rising ocean temperatures. The necessary disease analysis required to inform conservation priorities is incredibly laborious, and acts as a significant bottleneck for research. To this end, we developed EeLISA (Eelgrass Lesion Image Segmentation Application). EeLISA enables ecologist experts to train a segmentation module to perform this crucial analysis at human level accuracy, while minimizing their labeling time and integrating into their existing workflow. EeLISA has been deployed for over 16 months, and has facilitated the preparation of four manuscripts including a critical eelgrass study ranging from Southern California to Alaska. These studies, utilizing EeLISA, have led to scientific insight and discovery in marine disease ecology."}

While a large-size deeper model could provide competitive accuracy, it creates a lot of logistical challenges and unreasonable resource requirements during development and deployment. This has been one of the key reasons for deep learning models not being excessively used in various production environments, especially in edge devices. There is an immediate requirement for optimizing and compressing these deep learning models, to enable on-device intelligence. In this research, we introduce a black-box framework, Deeplite Neutrino^{TM} for production-ready optimization of deep learning models. The framework provides an easy mechanism for the end-users to provide constraints such as a tolerable drop in accuracy or target size of the optimized models, to guide the whole optimization process. The framework is easy to include in an existing production pipeline and is available as a Python Package, supporting PyTorch and Tensorflow libraries. The optimization performance of the framework is shown across multiple benchmark datasets and popular deep learning models. Further, the framework is currently used in production and the results and testimonials from several clients are summarized."}

We also show how SKATE integrates with a neural rule-generation model to interactively suggest and acquire commonsense knowledge. We provide a preliminary coverage analysis of SKATE for the task of story understanding, and then describe a current business use-case of the technology in a restricted domain: COVID-19 policy design."}

How to leverage rich heterogeneous data based on various signals such as mobility, testing, and/or disease exposure for forecasting? How to handle noisy data and generate uncertainties in the forecast? In this paper, we present DeepCOVID, an operational deep learning framework designed for real-time COVID-19 forecasting.

The deployed framework also consists of modules for both real-time and retrospective exploratory analysis to enable interpretation of the forecasts.

This system requires accurate transient modeling, lower computation cost, and fewer observation data. To tackle these three challenges, we propose a novel deep learning approach using black-box knowledge distillation for both accurate and efficient transmission dynamics prediction in a practical manner. First, we leverage mixture models to develop an accurate, comprehensive, yet impractical simulation system. Next, we use simulated observation sequences to query the simulation system to retrieve simulated projection sequences as knowledge. Then, with the obtained query data, sequence mixup is proposed to improve query efficiency, increase knowledge diversity, and boost distillation model accuracy. Finally, we train a student deep neural network with the retrieved and mixed observation-projection sequences for practical use. The case study on COVID-19 justifies that our approach accurately projects infections with much lower computation cost when observation data are limited."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2021", "Area": "AI", "Where": "AAAI", "Abbreviation": "Attr2Style", "Title": "A Transfer Learning Approach for Inferring Fashion Styles via Apparel Attributes", "Abstract": "Popular fashion e-commerce platforms mostly provide details about low-level attributes of an apparel (for example, neck type, dress length, collar type, print etc) on their product detail pages. However, customers usually prefer to buy apparel based on their style information, or simply put, occasion (for example, party wear, sports wear, casual wear etc). Application of a supervised image-captioning model to generate style-based image captions is limited because obtaining ground-truth annotations in the form of style-based captions is difficult. This is because annotating style-based captions requires a certain amount of fashion domain expertise, and also adds to the costs and manual effort. On the contrary, low-level attribute based annotations are much more easily available. To address this issue, we propose a transfer-learning based image captioning model that is trained on a source dataset with sufficient attribute-based ground-truth captions, and used to predict style-based captions on a target dataset. The target dataset has only a limited amount of images with style-based ground-truth captions. The main motivation of our approach comes from the fact that most often there are correlations among the low-level attributes and the higher-level styles for an apparel. We leverage this fact and train our model in an encoder-decoder based framework using attention mechanism. In particular, the encoder of the model is first trained on the source dataset to obtain latent representations capturing the low-level attributes. The trained model is fine-tuned to generate style-based captions for the target dataset. To highlight the effectiveness of our method, we qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that the captions generated by our approach are close to the actual style information for the evaluated apparel. A Proof Of Concept (POC) for our model is under pilot at Myntra (www.myntra.com) where it is exposed to some internal users for feedback."}

JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) is leading this trend by leveraging knowledge graphs across the organization for multiple mission critical applications such as risk assessment, fraud detection, investment advice, etc. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph is to link mentions (e.g., company names) that are encountered in textual sources to entities in the knowledge graph. Although several techniques exist for entity linking, they are tuned for entities that exist in Wikipedia, and fail to generalize for the entities that are of interest to an enterprise. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural entity linking model (JEL) that uses minimal context information and a margin loss to generate entity embeddings, and a Wide & Deep Learning model to match character and semantic information respectively. We show that JEL achieves the state-of-the-art performance to link mentions of company names in financial news with entities in our knowledge graph. We report on our efforts to deploy this model in the company-wide system to generate alerts in response to financial news. The methodology used for JEL is directly applicable and usable by other enterprises who need entity linking solutions for data that are unique to their respective situations."}

Uncontrolled wildfires take away human lives, destroy millions of animals and trees, degrade the air quality, impact the biodiversity of the planet and cause substantial economic costs. It is incredibly challenging to predict the spatio-temporal likelihood of wildfires based on historical data, due to their stochastic nature. Crucially though, the accurate and reliable prediction of wildfires can help the stakeholders and decision-makers take timely, strategic and effective actions to prevent, detect and suppress the wildfires before they become unmanageable. Unfortunately, most previous studies developed predictive models that suffer from some shortcomings: (i) they do not take the temporal aspects into account precisely and they assume the independent and identically distributed random variables in the evaluation phase; (ii) they do not evaluate their approaches comprehensively, thus it is not clear if their proposed predictions and selected models are reliable across different locations and time steps for practical deployment; and (iii) for the supervised learning models, they use predictor features and fire observations from the same time step in the training phase, which makes the inference task infeasible for future fire prediction. In this paper, we revisit the wildfire predictive modeling, explore the inherent challenges from a practical perspective and evaluate our modeling approach comprehensively via historical burned areas, climate and geospatial data from three vast landscapes in India."}

This has generated increased demand for fostering an AI-literate populace as well as a growing recognition of the importance of promoting K-12 students’ awareness and interest in AI. Although efforts are be-ginning to incorporate AI learning within K-12 education, there is little research exploring how to introduce students to AI and how to support teachers to integrate AI learning experiences in their classrooms. This is especially true at the elementary school level. A particularly promising approach for providing effective and engaging AI learning experiences for elementary students is game-based learning. In this paper, we explore how to introduce AI-infused collaborative inquiry learning into upper elementary school (student ages 8 to 11) using game-based learning. To ground the work in the realities of elementary school classrooms, we present insights from interviews with elementary school teachers to under-stand how best to support them in integrating AI into their classrooms. We then present the design of PrimaryAI, a game-based learning environment that supports rich problem-based learning activities within upper elementary classrooms centered on AI applied toward solving life-science problems. Finally, we discuss some of the challenges we face in bringing AI-infused collaborative inquiry learning to upper elementary students."}

Researchers are developing tools and curriculum to teach K-12 students broadly about artificial intelligence (AI); however, few studies have evaluated these tools with respect to AI-specific learning outcomes, and even fewer have addressed student learning about AI-based conversational agents. We evaluated our Conversational Agent Interface for MIT App Inventor and workshop curriculum with respect to 8 AI competencies from the literature. Furthermore, we analyze teacher (n=9) and student (n=47) feedback from workshops with the interface and recommend that future work (1) leverages design considerations to optimize engagement, (2) collaborates with teachers, and (3) addresses a range of student abilities through pacing and opportunities for extension. We found evidence for student understanding of all 8 competencies, with the most difficult concepts being AI ethics and machine learning. We recommend emphasizing these topics in future curricula."}

While GANs have now become commonplace on social media, a part of children’s lives, and have considerable ethical implications, existing K-12 AI education curricula do not include generative AI. We present a new module, “What are GANs?”, that teaches middle school students how GANs work and how they can create media using GANs. We developed an online, team-based game to simulate how GANs work. Students also interacted with up to four web tools that apply GANs to generate media. This module was piloted with 72 middle school students in a series of online workshops. We provide insight into student usage, understanding, and attitudes towards this lesson. Finally, we give suggestions for integrating this lesson into AI education curricula."}

Nonetheless, games involving chance and imperfect information offer unique challenges for optimizing gameplay. In this paper, we analyze one such card game, gin rummy, and propose an artificial intelligence player based on empirically driven strategies. Our approach separates gameplay into three disjoint policies for drawing, discarding, and knocking. On each turn, decisions are influenced by offensive considerations as well as defensive moves. Tournament-style simulations enable us to determine statistically which combination of policies achieves the highest win rate. Our resulting player, dubbed Heisenbot, is competitive against strong baseline strategies."}

In recent years, many fantastic works have emerged in this field by modeling image-text interactions; however, they neglect the fact that most of multimodal documents have been elaborately organized by their writers. This means that a critical organized factor has long been short of enough attention, that is, image locations, which may carry illuminating information and imply the key contents of a document. To address this issue, we propose a location-aware approach for multimodal summarization (LAMS) based on Transformer. We investigate image locations for multimodal summarization via a stack of multimodal fusion block, which can formulate the high-order interactions among images and texts. An extensive experimental study on an extended multimodal dataset validates the superior summarization performance of the proposed model."}

While the effectiveness of fixed-rate discounting in various Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings is well-established, the efficiency of this scheme has been questioned in recent studies.  Another notable shortcoming of fixed-rate discounting stems from abstracting away the experiential information of the agent, which is shown to be a significant component of delay discounting in human cognition. To address this issue, we propose State-wise Adaptive Discounting from Experience (SADE) as a novel adaptive discounting scheme for RL agents. SADE leverages the experiential observations of state values in episodic trajectories to iteratively adjust state-specific discount rates. We report experimental evaluations of SADE in Q-learning agents, which demonstrate significant enhancement of sample complexity and convergence rate compared to fixed-rate discounting."}

It handles the state uncertainty by specifying the probability of getting a particular observation given the current state. DESPOT is one of the most popular scalable online planning algorithms for POMDPs, which manages to significantly reduce the size of the decision tree while deriving a near-optimal policy by considering only $K$ scenarios. Nevertheless, there is a gap in action selection criteria between planning and execution in DESPOT. During the planning stage, it keeps choosing the action with the highest upper bound, whereas when the planning ends, the action with the highest lower bound is chosen for execution. Here, we propose LB-DESPOT to alleviate this issue, which utilizes the lower bound in selecting an action branch to expand. Empirically, our method has attained better performance than DESPOT and POMCP, which is another state-of-the-art, on several challenging POMDP benchmark tasks."}

Although adding new structures such as convolution kernels in CNN is widely used, there are few methods to design new structures and mathematical tools to evaluate feature representation capabilities of new structures. Inspired by ensemble learning, we propose an interpretable regularization method named Minimize Mutual Information Method(MMIM), which minimize the generalization error by minimizing the mutual information of hidden neurons. The experimental results also verify the effectiveness of our proposed MMIM."}

Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) utilizes an external sentiment classifier to update the hidden states of GPT-2 at each time step. It does not change the parameters but achieves competitive performance. However, fluency is impaired due to the instability of the hidden states. Moreover, the classifier is not strong because of the way it is trained with partial texts, hence it is difficult to guide the generation in the process. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we first propose a fixed threshold method based on the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) lexicon to decide whether to change a word, which keeps the fluency of the original LM to the greatest extent. Furthermore, for the improvement of sentiment alignment, we propose a dynamic threshold method that utilizes VAD-based loss to make the threshold dynamic. Experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform the baseline with a great margin significantly both on fluency and sentiment accuracy."}

Therefore, we propose a WildfireNet that can predict the shape of the wildfire of the next day, when given historical wildfire profiles, elevation, and weather data. The motivation behind WildfireNet is to locate fires in a precise manner and be able to accurately predict upcoming fires. The model’s architecture was built in the inspiration of U-Net, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) commonly used in a biomedical image segmentation. Intersection over Union (IoU) and recall were calculated to measure the performance of the model. The model achieved an IoU score of 0.997 in the test set. Since the objective of the model is to predict upcoming fires, pixels that were labeled as fire but not on the previous days were extracted to calculate recall. In the test set, Wild-fireNet scored a recall of around 0.75 for fires that grew slowly. Overall, WildfireNet is a novel wildfire spread model and has the potential to be a tool to aid firefighters in their decision making."}

However, the dynamics of experience replay are not yet well understood. To showcase this, we focus on a single component of this problem, namely choosing the batch size of the buffer samples. We find that small batches perform much better at stopping forgetting than larger batches, contrary to the intuitive assumption that it is better to recall more samples from the past to avoid forgetting. We show that this phenomenon does not disappear under learning rate tuning and we propose possible directions for further analysis."}

The existing approaches use a two-step process, which rely on Region Proposal Network (RPN), where the action is estimated based on the detected proposals followed by post-processing such as non-maximal suppression. While effective in terms of performance, these methods pose limitations in scalability for dense video scenes with a high memory requirement for thousand of proposals, which leads to slow processing time. We propose SSA2D, a unified end-to-end deep network, which performs joint actor-action detection in a single-shot without the need of any proposals and post-processing, making it memory as well as time efficient."}

Research has evolved from implementing physics-based solutions to using very deep CNNs and GANs. However, these state-of-art algorithms are computationally expensive and memory intensive. This hinders their deployment on portable devices for underwater exploration tasks. These models are trained on either synthetic or limited real-world datasets making them less practical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a shallow neural network architecture, Shallow-UWnet which maintains performance and has fewer parameters than the state-of-art models. We also demonstrated the generalization of our model by benchmarking its performance on a combination of synthetic and real-world datasets."}

Some popular algorithms using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for semi-supervised classification share a single architecture for classification and discrimination. However, this may require a model to converge to a separate data distribution for each task, which may reduce overall performance. While progress in semi-supervised learning has been made, less addressed are small-scale, fully-supervised tasks where even unlabeled data is unavailable and unattainable. We therefore, propose a novel GAN model namely External Classifier GAN (EC-GAN), that utilizes GANs and semi-supervised algorithms to improve classification in fully-supervised regimes. Our method leverages a GAN to generate artificial data used to supplement supervised classification. More specifically, we attach an external classifier, hence the name EC-GAN, to the GAN’s generator, as opposed to sharing an architecture with the discriminator. Our experiments demonstrate that EC-GAN's performance is comparable to the shared architecture method, far superior to the standard data augmentation and regularization-based approach, and effective on a small, realistic dataset."}

In order to make this comparison, we propose HetSAGE, a GNN architecture that can efficiently deal with the resulting heterogeneous graphs that represent typical NSL learning problems.

While the entertainment impact in terms of lives that Bollywood can potentially touch is mammoth, no NLP study on social biases in Bollywood content exists. We thus seek to understand social biases in a developing country through the lens of popular movies. Our argument is simple --  popular movie content reflects social norms and beliefs in some form or shape. We present our preliminary findings on a longitudinal corpus of English subtitles of  popular Bollywood movies focusing on (1) social bias toward a fair skin color (2) gender biases, and (3) gender representation. We contrast our findings with a similar corpus of Hollywood movies. Surprisingly, we observe that much of the biases we report in our preliminary experiments on the Bollywood corpus, also gets reflected in the Hollywood corpus."}

We propose a new framework, Network Epoch Accuracy Prediction Framework (NEAP-F) which can predict the testing accuracy achieved by a convolutional neural network in one or more epochs. We introduce a novel approach to generate vector representations for networks, and encode ``ease\" of classifying image datasets into a vector. For vector representations of networks, we focus on the layer parameters and connections between the network layers. A network achieves different accuracies on different image datasets; therefore, we use the image dataset characteristics to create a vector signifying the ``ease\" of classifying the image dataset. After generating these vectors, the prediction models are trained with architectures having skip connections seen in current state-of-the-art architectures. The framework predicts accuracies in order of milliseconds, demonstrating its computational efficiency. It can be easily applied to neural architecture search methods to predict the performance of candidate networks and can work on unseen datasets as well."}

In PoLe, the training/testing data are released to the entire blockchain network (BCN) and the consensus nodes train NN models on the data, which serves as the proof of learning. When the consensus on the BCN considers a NN model to be valid, a new block is appended to the blockchain.

Facing the complicated real-world scenes, recent studies reveal that combining multiple geometric models would be a more effective way than just employing a single one. This motivates a new wave of model-fusion based motion segmentation methods. However, the vast majority of models of this kind merely seek consensus in spectral embeddings. We argue that a simple consensus might be insufficient to filter out the harmful information which is either unreliable or semantically unrelated to the segmentation task. Therefore, how to automatically select valuable patterns across multiple models should be regarded as a key challenge here. In this paper, we present a novel geometric-model-fusion framework for motion segmentation, which targets at constructing a consistent affinity matrix across all the geometric models. Specifically, it incorporates the structural information shared by affinity matrices to select those semantically consistent entries. Meanwhile, a multiplicative decomposition scheme is adopted to ensure structural consistency among multiple affinities. To solve this problem, an alternative optimization scheme is proposed, together with a proof of its global convergence. Experiments on four real-world benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed method."}

Yet, detection approaches require strong annotation (bounding boxes) both for pre-training and for adaptation to novel classes, and classification approaches rarely provide localization of objects in the scene. In this paper, we introduce StarNet - a few-shot model featuring an end-to-end differentiable non-parametric star-model detection and classification head. Through this head, the backbone is meta-trained using only image-level labels to produce good features for jointly localizing and classifying previously unseen categories of few-shot test tasks using a star-model that geometrically matches between the query and support images (to find corresponding object instances). Being a few-shot detector, StarNet does not require any bounding box annotations, neither during pre-training nor for novel classes adaptation. It can thus be applied to the previously unexplored and challenging task of Weakly Supervised Few-Shot Object Detection (WS-FSOD), where it attains significant improvements over the baselines. In addition, StarNet shows significant gains on few-shot classification benchmarks that are less cropped around the objects (where object localization is key)."}

In this challenge, no additional image-caption training data, other than COCO Captions, is allowed for model training. Thus, conventional Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) methods cannot be applied. This paper presents VIsual VOcabulary pre-training (VIVO) that performs pre-training in the absence of caption annotations. By breaking the dependency of paired image-caption training data in VLP, VIVO can leverage large amounts of paired image-tag data to learn a visual vocabulary. This is done by pre-training a multi-layer Transformer model that learns to align image-level tags with their corresponding image region features. To address the unordered nature of image tags, VIVO uses a Hungarian matching loss with masked tag prediction to conduct pre-training.  We validate the effectiveness of VIVO by fine-tuning the pre-trained model for image captioning. In addition, we perform an analysis of the visual-text alignment inferred by our model. The results show that our model can not only generate fluent image captions that describe novel objects, but also identify the locations of these objects. Our single model has achieved new state-of-the-art results on nocaps and surpassed the human CIDEr score."}

In this paper, we propose a Poisson Transfer Network (PTN) to mine the unlabeled information for SSFSL from two aspects. First, the Poisson Merriman–Bence–Osher (MBO) model builds a bridge for the communications between labeled and unlabeled examples. This model serves as a more stable and informative classifier than traditional graph-based SSFSL methods in the message-passing process of the labels. Second, the extra unlabeled samples are employed to transfer the knowledge from base classes to novel classes through contrastive learning. Specifically, we force the augmented positive pairs close while push the negative ones distant. Our contrastive transfer scheme implicitly learns the novel-class embeddings to alleviate the over-fitting problem on the few labeled data. Thus, we can mitigate the degeneration of embedding generality in novel classes. Extensive experiments indicate that PTN outperforms the state-of-the-art few-shot and SSFSL models on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet benchmark datasets."}

Recent methods mix labels mainly according to the mixture proportion of image pixels. Due to the major discriminative information of a fine-grained image usually resides in subtle regions, these methods tend to introduce heavy label noise in fine-grained recognition. We propose Semantically Proportional Mixing (SnapMix) that exploits class activation map (CAM) to lessen the label noise in augmenting fine-grained data. SnapMix generates the target label for a mixed image by estimating its intrinsic semantic composition. This strategy can adapt to asymmetric mixing operations and ensure semantic correspondence between synthetic images and target labels. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing mixed-based approaches regardless of different datasets or network depths. Further, by incorporating the mid-level features, the proposed SnapMix achieves top-level performance, demonstrating its potential to serve as a strong baseline for fine-grained recognition."}

Most existing methods address this challenge by aligning spatial features of body parts according to semantic information (e.g. human poses) or feature similarities but this approach is complicated and sensitive to noises. This paper presents Matching on Sets (MoS), a novel method that positions occluded person re-ID as a set matching task without requiring spatial alignment. MoS encodes a person image by a pattern set as represented by a `global vector’ with each element capturing one specific visual pattern, and it introduces Jaccard distance as a metric to compute the distance between pattern sets and measure image similarity. To enable Jaccard distance over continuous real numbers, we employ minimization and maximization to approximate the operations of intersection and union, respectively. In addition, we design a Jaccard triplet loss that enhances the pattern discrimination and allows to embed set matching into deep neural networks for end-to-end training. In the inference stage, we introduce a conflict penalty mechanism that detects mutually exclusive patterns in the pattern union of image pairs and decreases their similarities accordingly. Extensive experiments over three widely used datasets (Market1501, DukeMTMC and Occluded-DukeMTMC) show that MoS achieves superior re-ID performance. Additionally, it is tolerant of occlusions and outperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins for Occluded-DukeMTMC."}

Existing works solve the WSOD problem by using a two-stage framework, i.e., generating candidate bounding boxes with weak supervision information and then refining them by directly employing supervised object detection models. However, most of such works mainly focus on the performance boosting of the first stage, while ignoring the better usage of generated candidate bounding boxes. To address this issue, we propose a new two-stage framework for WSOD, named GradingNet, which can make good use of the generated candidate bounding boxes. Specifically, the proposed GradingNet consists of two modules: Boxes Grading Module (BGM) and Informative Boosting Module (IBM). BGM generates proposals of the bounding boxes by using standard one-stage weakly-supervised methods, then utilizes Inclusion Principle to pick out highly-reliable boxes and evaluate the grade of each box. With the above boxes and their grade information, an effective anchor generator and a grade-aware loss are carefully designed to train the IBM. Taking the advantages of the grade information, our GradingNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on COCO, VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 benchmarks."}

The same part of person (e.g. head or hand) appearing on different locations in video sequence weakens its discriminative ability, especially when we apply standard temporal aggregation such as 3D convolution or LSTM. To address this issue, we propose Self-Separated network (SSN)  to seek out the same parts in different images.  As the name implies, SSN, if trained in an unsupervised strategy, guarantees the selected parts distinct. With a few samples of labeled parts to guide SSN training, this semi-supervised trained SSN seeks out the parts that are human-understandable within a frame and stable across a video snippet. Given the distinct and stable person parts, rather than performing aggregation on features, we then apply 3D convolution across different frames for person re-identification.  This SSN + 3D pipeline, dubbed SSN3D, is proved to be efficient through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data."}

Previous approaches only utilize single-frame features for the detection, segmentation, and tracking of objects and they suffer in the video scenario due to several distinct challenges such as motion blur and drastic appearance change. To eliminate ambiguities introduced by only using single-frame features, we propose a novel comprehensive feature aggregation approach (CompFeat) to refine features atboth frame-level and object-level with temporal and spatial context information. The aggregation process is carefully designed with a new attention mechanism which significantly increases the discriminative power of the learned features. We further improve the tracking capability of our model through a siamese design by incorporating both feature similarities and spatial similarities. Experiments conducted on the YouTube-VIS dataset validate the effectiveness of proposed CompFeat."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2021", "Area": "AI", "Where": "AAAI", "Abbreviation": "Proxy Synthesis", "Title": "Learning with Synthetic Classes for Deep Metric Learning", "Abstract": "One of the main purposes of deep metric learning is to construct an embedding space that has well-generalized embeddings on both seen (training) classes and unseen (test) classes. Most existing works have tried to achieve this using different types of metric objectives and hard sample mining strategies with given training data. However, learning with only the training data can be overfitted to the seen classes, leading to the lack of generalization capability on unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose a simple regularizer called Proxy Synthesis that exploits synthetic classes for stronger generalization in deep metric learning. The proposed method generates synthetic embeddings and proxies that work as synthetic classes, and they mimic unseen classes when computing proxy-based losses. Proxy Synthesis derives an embedding space considering class relations and smooth decision boundaries for robustness on unseen classes. Our method is applicable to any proxy-based losses, including softmax and its variants. Extensive experiments on four famous benchmarks in image retrieval tasks demonstrate that Proxy Synthesis significantly boosts the performance of proxy-based losses and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Existing methods often make specific assumptions of the rain model, which can hardly cover many diverse circumstances in the real world, compelling them to employ complex optimization or progressive refinement. This, however, significantly affects these methods' efficiency and effectiveness for many efficiency-critical applications. To fill this gap, in this paper, we regard the single-image deraining as a general image-enhancing problem and originally propose a model-free deraining method, i.e., EfficientDeRain, which is able to process a rainy image within 10 ms (i.e., around 6 ms on average), over 80 times faster than the state-of-the-art method (i.e., RCDNet), while achieving similar de-rain effects. We first propose novel pixel-wise dilation filtering. In particular, a rainy image is filtered with the pixel-wise kernels estimated from a kernel prediction network, by which suitable multi-scale kernels for each pixel can be efficiently predicted. Then, to eliminate the gap between synthetic and real data, we further propose an effective data augmentation method (i.e., RainMix) that helps to train the network for handling real rainy images. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both synthetic and real-world rainy datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

For high efficiency, one-step methods have been developed to jointly handle the pedestrian detection and identification sub-tasks using a single network. There are two major challenges in the current one-step approaches. One is the mutual interference between the optimization objectives of multiple sub-tasks. The other is the sub-optimal identification feature learning caused by small batch size when end-to-end training. To overcome these problems, we propose a decoupled and memory-reinforced network (DMRNet). Specifically, to reconcile the conflicts of multiple objectives, we simplify the standard tightly coupled pipelines and establish a deeply decoupled multi-task learning framework. Further, we build a memory-reinforced mechanism to boost the identification feature learning. By queuing the identification features of recently accessed instances into a memory bank, the mechanism augments the similarity pair construction for pairwise metric learning. For better encoding consistency of the stored features, a slow-moving average of the network is applied for extracting these features. In this way, the dual networks reinforce each other and converge to robust solution states. Experimentally, the proposed method obtains 93.2% and 46.9% mAP on CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets, which exceeds all the existing one-step methods."}

To overcome this problem, generative replay technique has been suggested, which can generate samples belonging to learned classes while learning new ones. However, such generative models usually suffer from increased distribution mismatch between the generated and original samples along the learning process. In this work, we propose DeepCollaboration (D-Collab), a collaborative framework of deep generative and discriminative models to solve this problem effectively. We develop a discriminative learning model to incrementally update the latent feature space for continual classification. At the same time, a generative model is introduced to achieve conditional generation using the latent feature distribution produced by the discriminative model. Importantly, the generative and discriminative models are connected through bidirectional training to enforce cycle-consistency of mappings between feature and image domains. Furthermore, a domain alignment module is used to eliminate the divergence between the feature distributions of generated images and real ones. This module together with the discriminative model can perform effective sample mining to facilitate incremental learning. Extensive experiments on several visual recognition datasets show that our system can achieve state-of-the-art performance."}

Simultaneously, to increase the robustness of watermark, attacking technique, such as watermark removal, also gets the attention from the community. Previous watermark removal methods require to gain the watermark location from users or train a multi-task network to recover the background indiscriminately. However, when jointly learning, the network performs better on watermark detection than recovering the texture. Inspired by this observation and to erase the visible watermarks blindly, we propose a novel two-stage framework with a stacked attention-guided ResUNets to simulate the process of detection, removal and refinement.  In the first stage, we design a multi-task network called SplitNet. It learns the basis features for three sub-tasks altogether while the task-specific features separately use multiple channel attentions. Then, with the predicted mask and coarser restored image, we design RefineNet to smooth the watermarked region with a mask-guided spatial attention. Besides network structure, the proposed algorithm also combines multiple perceptual losses for better quality both visually and numerically.  We extensively evaluate our algorithm over four different datasets under various settings and the experiments show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."}

In this work, we focus on two main problems: 1) how to design an effective pipeline for crowded scenes pose estimation; and 2) how to equip this pipeline with the ability of relation modeling for interference resolving. To tackle these problems, we propose a new pipeline named Relation based Skeleton Graph Network (RSGNet). Unlike existing works that directly predict joints-of-target by labeling joints-of-interference as false positive, we first encourage all joints to be predicted. And then, a Target-aware Relation Parser (TRP) is designed to model the relation over all predicted joints, resulting in a target-aware encoding. This new pipeline will largely relieve the confusion of the joints estimation model when seeing identical joints with totally distinct labels (e.g., the identical hand exists in two bounding boxes). Furthermore, we introduce a Skeleton Graph Machine (SGM) to model the skeleton-based commonsense knowledge, aiming to estimate the target pose with the constraint of human body structure. Such skeleton-based constraint can help to deal with the challenges in crowded scenes from a reasoning perspective. Solid experiments on pose estimation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

Many existing high performance 3D detectors are point-based because this structure can better retain precise point positions. Nevertheless, point-level features lead to high computation overheads due to unordered storage. In contrast, the voxel-based structure is better suited for feature extraction but often yields lower accuracy because the input data are divided into grids. In this paper, we take a slightly different viewpoint --- we find that precise positioning of raw points is not essential for high performance 3D object detection and that the coarse voxel granularity can also offer sufficient detection accuracy. Bearing this view in mind, we devise a simple but effective voxel-based framework, named Voxel R-CNN. By taking full advantage of voxel features in a two-stage approach, our method achieves comparable detection accuracy with state-of-the-art point-based models, but at a fraction of the computation cost.  Voxel R-CNN consists of a 3D backbone network, a 2D bird-eye-view (BEV) Region Proposal Network, and a detect head. A voxel RoI pooling is devised to extract RoI features directly from voxel features for further refinement. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used KITTI Dataset and the more recent Waymo Open Dataset.  Our results show that compared to existing voxel-based methods, Voxel R-CNN delivers a higher detection accuracy while maintaining a real-time frame processing rate,  i.e., at a speed of 25 FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU.

In most of the related HDR imaging methods, the problem is usually solved by Multiple Images Merging, i.e. the final HDR image is fused from pixels of all the input LDR images. However, ghost artifacts can be hardly avoided using this strategy. Instead of directly merging the multiple LDR inputs, we use an indirect way which enhances the main image, i.e. the short exposure image IS, using the long exposure image IL serving as guidance. In detail, we propose a new model, named MIEHDR CNN model, which consists of three subnets, i.e. Soft Warp CNN, 3D Guided Denoising CNN and Fusion CNN. The Soft Warp CNN aligns IL to get the aligned result ILA using the soft exposed result of IS as reference. The 3D Guided Denoising CNN denoises the soft exposed result of IS using ILA as guidance, whose result are fed into the Fusion CNN with IS to get the HDR result. The MIEHDR CNN model is implemented by MindSpore and experimental results show that we can outperform related methods largely and avoid ghost artifacts."}

However, conventional two-stage methods are usually slow in inference. On the other hand, existing one-stage methods mainly focus on the union regions of interactions, which introduce unnecessary visual information as disturbances to HOI detection. To tackle the problems above, we propose a novel one-stage HOI detection approach DIRV in this paper, based on a new concept called interaction region for the HOI problem. Unlike previous methods, our approach concentrates on the densely sampled interaction regions across different scales for each human-object pair, so as to capture the subtle visual features that is most essential to the interaction. Moreover, in order to compensate for the detection flaws of a single interaction region, we introduce a novel voting strategy that makes full use of those overlapped interaction regions in place of conventional Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS). Extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks: V-COCO and HICO-DET show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-arts by a large margin with the highest inference speed and lightest network architecture.

Based on our proposed object state similarity metric, object patterns across different HOIs are shared to augment local object appearance features without changing their states. Further, we shift spatial correlation between humans and objects to other feasible configurations with the aid of a pose-guided Gaussian Mixture Model while preserving their interactions. Experiments show that our method brings up to 3.3 mAP and 1.6 mAP improvements on V-COCO and HICO-DET dataset for two advanced models.

In this paper, we propose and study Wild-JDD, a novel learning framework for joint demosaicking and denoising in the wild. In contrast to previous works which generally assume the ground truth of training data is a perfect reflection of the reality, we consider here the more common imperfect case of ground truth uncertainty in the wild. We first illustrate its manifestation as various kinds of artifacts including zipper effect, color moire and residual noise. Then we formulate a two-stage data degradation process to capture such ground truth uncertainty, where a conjugate prior distribution is imposed upon a base distribution. After that, we derive an evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss to train a neural network that approximates the parameters of the conjugate prior distribution conditioned on the degraded input. Finally, to further enhance the performance for out-of-distribution input, we design a simple but effective fine-tuning strategy by taking the input as a weakly informative prior. Taking into account ground truth uncertainty, Wild-JDD enjoys good interpretability during optimization. Extensive experiments validate that it outperforms state-of-the-art schemes on joint demosaicking and denoising tasks on both synthetic and realistic raw datasets."}

Existing two-stage solutions mostly focus on the grounding step, which aims to align the expressions with the proposals. In this paper, we argue that these methods overlook an obvious mismatch between the roles of proposals in the two stages: they generate proposals solely based on the detection confidence (i.e., expression-agnostic), hoping that the proposals contain all right instances in the expression (i.e., expression-aware). Due to this mismatch, current two-stage methods suffer from a severe performance drop between detected and ground-truth proposals. To this end, we propose Ref-NMS, which is the first method to yield expression-aware proposals at the first stage. Ref-NMS regards all nouns in the expression as critical objects, and introduces a lightweight module to predict a score for aligning each box with a critical object. These scores can guide the NMS operation to filter out the boxes irrelevant to the expression, increasing the recall of critical objects, resulting in a significantly improved grounding performance. Since Ref- NMS is agnostic to the grounding step, it can be easily integrated into any state-of-the-art two-stage method. Extensive ablation studies on several backbones, benchmarks, and tasks consistently demonstrate the superiority of Ref-NMS. Codes are available at: https://github.com/ChopinSharp/ref-nms."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2021", "Area": "AI", "Where": "AAAI", "Abbreviation": "RSPNet", "Title": "Relative Speed Perception for Unsupervised Video Representation Learning", "Abstract": "We study unsupervised video representation learning that seeks to learn both motion and appearance features from unlabeled video only, which can be reused for downstream tasks such as action recognition. This task, however, is extremely challenging due to 1) the highly complex spatial-temporal information in videos and 2) the lack of labeled data for training. Unlike representation learning for static images, it is difficult to construct a suitable self-supervised task to effectively model both motion and appearance features. More recently, several attempts have been made to learn video representation through video playback speed prediction. However, it is non-trivial to obtain precise speed labels for the videos. More critically, the learned models may tend to focus on motion patterns and thus may not learn appearance features well. In this paper, we observe that the relative playback speed is more consistent with motion patterns and thus provides more effective and stable supervision for representation learning. Therefore, we propose a new way to perceive the playback speed and exploit the relative speed between two video clips as labels. In this way, we are able to effectively perceive speed and learn better motion features. Moreover, to ensure the learning of appearance features, we further propose an appearance-focused task, where we enforce the model to perceive the appearance difference between two video clips. We show that jointly optimizing the two tasks consistently improves the performance on two downstream tasks (namely, action recognition and video retrieval) w.r.t the increasing pre-training epochs. Remarkably, for action recognition on the UCF101 dataset, we achieve 93.7% accuracy without the use of labeled data for pre-training, which outperforms the ImageNet supervised pre-trained model.

This issue makes the generator lack the incentive from the discriminator to learn high-frequency content of data, resulting in a significant spectrum discrepancy between generated images and real images. Since the Fourier transform is a bijective mapping, we argue that reducing this spectrum discrepancy would boost the performance of GANs. To this end, we introduce SSD-GAN, an enhancement of GANs to alleviate the spectral information loss in the discriminator. Specifically, we propose to embed a frequency-aware classifier into the discriminator to measure the realness of the input in both the spatial and spectral domains. With the enhanced discriminator, the generator of SSD-GAN is encouraged to learn high-frequency content of real data and generate exact details. The proposed method is general and can be easily integrated into most existing GANs framework without excessive cost. The effectiveness of SSD-GAN is validated on various network architectures, objective functions, and datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/cyq373/SSD-GAN."}

Existing methods mainly focus on employing a large number of annotated labels for supervised semantic segmentation. Nonetheless, manually labeling such large point clouds for the supervised segmentation task is time-consuming. In order to reduce the number of annotated labels, we propose a semi-supervised semantic point cloud segmentation network, named SSPC-Net, where we train the semantic segmentation network by inferring the labels of unlabeled points from the few annotated 3D points. In our method, we first partition the whole point cloud into superpoints and build superpoint graphs to mine the long-range dependencies in point clouds. Based on the constructed superpoint graph, we then develop a dynamic label propagation method to generate the pseudo labels for the unsupervised superpoints. Particularly, we adopt a superpoint dropout strategy to dynamically select the generated pseudo labels. In order to fully exploit the generated pseudo labels of the unsupervised superpoints, we furthermore propose a coupled attention mechanism for superpoint feature embedding. Finally, we employ the cross-entropy loss to train the semantic segmentation network with the labels of the supervised superpoints and the pseudo labels of the unsupervised superpoints. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our semisupervised segmentation method can achieve better performance than the current semi-supervised segmentation method with fewer annotated 3D points."}

Importantly, our goal is to build neural episodic memories and spatio-semantic representations of 3D spaces that enable the agent to easily learn subsequent tasks in the same space – navigating to objects seen during the tour (‘Find chair’) or answering questions about the space (‘How many chairs did you see in the house?’). Towards this goal, we present Semantic MapNet (SMNet), which consists of: (1) an Egocentric Visual Encoder that encodes each egocentric RGB-D frame, (2) a Feature Projector that projects egocentric features to appropriate locations on a floor-plan, (3) a Spatial Memory Tensor of size floor-plan length×width×feature-dims that learns to accumulate projected egocentric features, and (4) a Map Decoder that uses the memory tensor to produce semantic top-down maps.

In this paper, we present BSN++, a new framework which exploits complementary boundary regressor and relation modeling for temporal proposal generation. First, we propose a novel boundary regressor based on the complementary characteristics of both starting and ending boundary classifiers.

Second, to account for the proposal-proposal relations ignored in previous methods, we devise a proposal relation block to which includes two self-attention modules from the aspects of position and channel. Furthermore, we find that there inevitably exists data imbalanced problems in the positive/negative proposals and temporal durations, which harm the model performance on tail distributions. To relieve this issue, we introduce the scale-balanced re-sampling strategy.

In this paper, we propose a multi-level aggregation architecture via memory bank called MAMBA. Specifically, our memory bank employs two novel operations to eliminate disadvantages of existing methods: (1) light-weight key-set construction which can significantly reduce the computational cost; (2) fine-grained feature-wise updating strategy which enables our method to utilize knowledge from the whole video. To better enhance features from complementary levels, i.e., feature maps and proposals, we further propose a generalized enhancement operation (GEO) to aggregate multi-level features in a unified manner.

Regularized Maximum Likelihood (RML) and feed-forward deep learning approaches for inverse problems typically focus on recovering a point estimate. This is a serious limitation when working with under-determined imaging systems, where it is conceivable that multiple image modes would be consistent with the measured data. Characterizing the space of probable images that explain the observational data is therefore crucial. In this paper, we propose a variational deep probabilistic imaging approach to quantify reconstruction uncertainty. Deep Probabilistic Imaging (DPI) employs an untrained deep generative model to estimate a posterior distribution of an unobserved image. This approach does not require any training data; instead, it optimizes the weights of a neural network to generate image samples that fit a particular measurement dataset. Once the network weights have been learned, the posterior distribution can be efficiently sampled. We demonstrate this approach in the context of interferometric radio imaging, which is used for black hole imaging with the Event Horizon Telescope, and compressed sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)."}

Such a detector can fully utilize information provided by keypoints with the following two aspects: i) integrating local features around keypoints to benefit both classification and regression; ii) generating accurate bounding boxes from keypoints. To effectively incorporate local features , two alternative modules are proposed. One is a multi-column keypoint-encoding-based feature aggregation module; the other is a keypoint-selection-based feature aggregation module.

Most methods attempt to develop various region of interest (RoI) operations to concatenate the detection part and the sequence recognition part into a two-stage text spotting framework. However, in such framework, the recognition part is highly sensitive to the detected results (e.g., the compactness of text contours). To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Mask AttentioN Guided One-stage text spotting framework named MANGO, in which character sequences can be directly recognized without RoI operation. Concretely, a position-aware mask attention module is developed to generate attention weights on each text instance and its characters. It allows different text instances in an image to be allocated on different feature map channels which are further grouped as a batch of instance features. Finally, a lightweight sequence decoder is applied to generate the character sequences. It is worth noting that MANGO inherently adapts to arbitrary-shaped text spotting and can be trained end-to-end with only coarse position information (e.g., rectangular bounding box) and text annotations. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive and even new state-of-the-art performance on both regular and irregular text spotting benchmarks, i.e., ICDAR 2013, ICDAR 2015, Total-Text, and SCUT-CTW1500."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel dynamic and progressive filter pruning (DPFPS) scheme that directly learns a structured sparsity network from Scratch. In particular, DPFPS imposes a new structured sparsity-inducing regularization specifically upon the expected pruning parameters in a dynamic sparsity manner. The dynamic sparsity scheme determines sparsity allocation ratios of different layers and a Taylor series based channel sensitivity criteria is presented to identify the expected pruning parameters. Moreover, we increase the structured sparsity-inducing penalty in a progressive manner. This helps the model to be sparse gradually instead of forcing the model to be sparse at the beginning. Our method solves the pruning ratio based optimization problem by an iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) with dynamic sparsity. At the end of the training, we only need to remove the redundant parameters without other stages, such as fine-tuning. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive with 11 state-of-the-art methods on both small-scale and large-scale datasets (i.e., CIFAR and ImageNet). Specifically, on ImageNet, we achieve a 44.97% pruning ratio of FLOPs by compressing ResNet-101, even with an increase of 0.12% Top-5 accuracy.

Recent methods for this problem have focused on modeling social interactions and predicting multi-modal futures. However, it is not easy for machines to successfully consider social interactions, such as avoiding collisions while considering the uncertainty of futures under a highly interactive and dynamic scenario. In this paper, we propose a model that incorporates multiple interacting motion sequences jointly and predicts multi-modal socially acceptable distributions of futures. Specifically, we introduce a new aggregation mechanism for social interactions, which selectively models long-term inter-related dynamics between movements in a shared environment through a message passing mechanism. Moreover, we propose a loss function that not only accesses how accurate the estimated distributions of the futures are but also considers collision avoidance. We further utilize mixture density functions to describe the trajectories and learn the multi-modality of future paths.  Extensive experiments over several trajectory prediction benchmarks demonstrate that our method is able to forecast socially acceptable distributions in complex scenarios."}

However, generating features that capture both factors always leads to high computational complexity, which is problematic in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new model, called Attention-Augmented Network (AttaNet), to capture both global context and multi-level semantics while keeping the efficiency high. AttaNet consists of two primary modules: Strip Attention Module (SAM) and Attention Fusion Module (AFM). Viewing that in challenging images with low segmentation accuracy, there are a significantly larger amount of vertical strip areas than horizontal ones, SAM utilizes a striping operation to reduce the complexity of encoding global context in the vertical direction drastically while keeping most of contextual information, compared to the non-local approaches. Moreover, AFM follows a cross-level aggregation strategy to limit the computation, and adopts an attention strategy to weight the importance of different levels of features at each pixel when fusing them, obtaining an efficient multi-level representation. We have conducted extensive experiments on two semantic segmentation benchmarks, and our network achieves different levels of speed/accuracy trade-offs on Cityscapes, e.g., 71 FPS/79.9% mIoU, 130 FPS/78.5% mIoU, and 180 FPS/70.1% mIoU, and leading performance on ADE20K as well."}

Generally, the frame rates of  mechanical LiDAR sensors are 10 to 20 Hz, which is much lower than other commonly used sensors like cameras. To overcome the temporal limitations of LiDAR sensors, a novel task named Point Cloud Frame Interpolation is studied in this paper. Given two consecutive point cloud frames, Point Cloud Frame Interpolation aims to generate intermediate frame(s) between them. To achieve that, we propose a novel framework, namely Point Cloud Frame Interpolation Network (PointINet). Based on the proposed method, the low frame rate point cloud streams can be upsampled to higher frame rates. We start by estimating bi-directional 3D scene flow between the two point clouds and then warp them to the given time step based on the 3D scene flow. To fuse the two warped frames and generate intermediate point cloud(s), we propose a novel learning-based points fusion module, which simultaneously takes two warped point clouds into consideration. We design both quantitative and qualitative experiments to evaluate the performance of the point cloud frame interpolation method and extensive experiments on two large scale outdoor LiDAR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PointINet.

However, most HMR-based frameworks reconstruct human body by directly learning mesh parameters from images or videos, while lacking explicit guidance of 3D human pose in visual data. As a result, the generated mesh often exhibits incorrect pose for complex activities. To tackle this problem, we propose to exploit 3D pose to calibrate human mesh. Specifically, we develop two novel Pose Calibration frameworks, i.e., Serial PC-HMR and Parallel PC-HMR. By coupling advanced 3D pose estimators and HMR in a serial or parallel manner, these two frameworks can effectively correct human mesh with guidance of a concise pose calibration module. Furthermore, since the calibration module is designed via non-rigid pose transformation, our PC-HMR frameworks can flexibly tackle bone length variations to alleviate misplacement in the calibrated mesh. Finally, our frameworks are based on generic and complementary integration of data-driven learning and geometrical modeling. Via plug-and-play modules, they can be efficiently adapted for both image/video-based human mesh recovery. Additionally, they have no requirement of extra 3D pose annotations in the testing phase, which releases inference difficulties in practice. We perform extensive experiments on the popular benchmarks, i.e., Human3.6M, 3DPW and SURREAL, where our PC-HMR frameworks achieve the SOTA results."}

DeepDT learns to predict inside/outside labels of Delaunay tetrahedrons directly from a point cloud and corresponding Delaunay triangulation. The local geometry features are first extracted from the input point cloud and aggregated into a graph deriving from the Delaunay triangulation. Then a graph filtering is applied on the aggregated features in order to add structural regularization to the label prediction of tetrahedrons. Due to the complicated spatial relations between tetrahedrons and the triangles, it is impossible to directly generate ground truth labels of tetrahedrons from ground truth surface. Therefore, we propose a multi-label supervision strategy which votes for the label of a tetrahedron with labels of sampling locations inside it. The proposed DeepDT can maintain abundant geometry details without generating overly complex surfaces, especially for inner surfaces of open scenes. Meanwhile, the generalization ability and time consumption of the proposed method is acceptable and competitive compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DeepDT."}

Although people try to use the high-resolution image  for  depth  estimation,  the  accuracy  of  prediction  has not  been  significantly  improved.  In  this  work,  we  find  the core  reason  comes  from  the  inaccurate  depth  estimation  in large gradient regions, making the bilinear interpolation error gradually disappear as the resolution increases. To obtain more accurate depth estimation in large gradient regions, it is  necessary  to  obtain  high-resolution  features  with  spatial and semantic information. Therefore, we present an improved DepthNet,  HR-Depth,  with  two  effective  strategies:  (1)  re-design  the  skip-connection  in  DepthNet  to  get  better  high-resolution features and (2) propose feature fusion Squeeze-and-Excitation(fSE) module to fuse feature more efficiently. Using Resnet-18 as the encoder, HR-Depth surpasses all previous  state-of-the-art(SoTA)  methods  with  the  least  parameters  at  both  high  and  low  resolution.  Moreover,  previous SoTA methods are based on fairly complex and deep networks with a mass of parameters which limits their real applications.

Although there exists research endeavor in developing novel methods to tackle the incompleteness of testing data, e.g., modalities are partially missing in testing examples, few of them can handle incomplete training modalities. The problem becomes even more challenging if considering the case of severely missing, e.g., ninety percent of training examples may have incomplete modalities. For the first time in the literature, this paper formally studies multimodal learning with missing modality in terms of flexibility (missing modalities in training, testing, or both) and efficiency (most training data have incomplete modality). Technically, we propose a new method named SMIL that leverages Bayesian meta-learning in uniformly achieving both objectives. To validate our idea, we conduct a series of experiments on three popular benchmarks: MM-IMDb, CMU-MOSI, and avMNIST. The results prove the state-of-the-art performance of SMIL over existing methods and generative baselines including autoencoders and generative adversarial networks."}

Current works in this area utilize complex generative or recurrent methods to capture many possible futures. However, despite the inherent real-time nature of predicting future paths, little work has been done to explore accurate and computationally efficient approaches for this task. To this end, we propose a convolutional approach for real-time pedestrian path prediction, CARPe. It utilizes a variation of Graph Isomorphism Networks in combination with an agile convolutional neural network design to form a fast and accurate path prediction approach.

The designed Recursive Dual-Directional Nested Structure in it forms two sets of orthogonal paths, recursive and structural ones, where bottom-up spatial features and top-down attention features are extracted respectively. Such spatial and attention features are nested deeply, therefore, the proposed framework works in a mixed top-down and bottom-up manner. Empirical evidence shows that our TDAF can capture effective stratified attention information and boost performance. ResNet with TDAF achieves 2.0% improvements on ImageNet. For object detection, the performance is improved by 2.7% AP over FCOS. For pose estimation, TDAF improves the baseline by 1.6%.

To resolve the restricted nature of existing video generation models' ability to handle arbitrary timesteps, we propose continuous-time video generation by combining neural ODE (Vid-ODE) with pixel-level video processing techniques. Using ODE-ConvGRU as an encoder, a convolutional version of the recently proposed neural ODE, which enables us to learn continuous-time dynamics, Vid-ODE can learn the spatio-temporal dynamics of input videos of flexible frame rates. The decoder integrates the learned dynamics function to synthesize video frames at any given timesteps, where the pixel-level composition technique is used to maintain the sharpness of individual frames. With extensive experiments on four real-world video datasets, we verify that the proposed Vid-ODE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under various video generation settings, both within the trained time range (interpolation) and beyond the range (extrapolation). To the best of our knowledge, Vid-ODE is the first work successfully performing continuous-time video generation using real-world videos."}

However, the considerable accuracy gap between BNNs and their full-precision counterparts hinders BNNs to be deployed to resource-constrained platforms. One of the main reasons for the performance gap can be attributed to the frequent weight flip, which is caused by the misleading weight update in BNNs. To address this issue, we propose a state-aware binary neural network (SA-BNN) equipped with the well designed state-aware gradient. Our SA-BNN is inspired by the observation that the frequent weight flip is more likely to occur, when the gradient magnitude for all quantization states {-1,1} is identical. Accordingly, we propose to employ independent gradient coefficients for different states when updating the weights. Furthermore, we also analyze the effectiveness of the state-aware gradient on suppressing the frequent weight flip problem. Experiments on ImageNet show that the proposed SA-BNN outperforms the current state-of-the-arts (e.g., Bi-Real Net) by more than 3% when using a ResNet architecture.

Specifically, our proposed network consists of three main parts: Siamese Encoder Module, Center Guiding Appearance Diffusion Module, and Dynamic Information Fusion Module. Firstly, we take a siamese encoder to extract the feature representations of paired frames (reference frame and current frame). Then, a Center Guiding Appearance Diffusion Module is designed to capture the inter-frame feature (dense correspondences between reference frame and current frame), intra-frame feature (dense correspondences in current frame), and original semantic feature of current frame. Different from the Anchor Diffusion Network, we establish a Center Prediction Branch to predict the center location of the foreground object in current frame and leverage the center point information as spatial guidance prior to enhance the inter-frame and intra-frame feature extraction, and thus the feature representation considerably focus on the foreground objects. Finally, we propose a Dynamic Information Fusion Module to automatically select relatively important features through three aforementioned different level features. Extensive experiments on DAVIS, Youtube-object, and FBMS datasets show that our proposed F2Net achieves the state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement."}

Recent approaches mainly formulate the depth completion as a one-stage end-to-end learning task, which outputs dense depth maps directly. However, the feature extraction and supervision in one-stage frameworks are insufficient, limiting the performance of these approaches. To address this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end residual learning framework, which formulates the depth completion as a two-stage learning task, i.e., a sparse-to-coarse stage and a coarse-to-fine stage. First, a coarse dense depth map is obtained by a simple CNN framework. Then, a refined depth map is further obtained using a residual learning strategy in the coarse-to-fine stage with coarse depth map and color image as input. Specially, in the coarse-to-fine stage, a channel shuffle extraction operation is utilized to extract more representative features from color image and coarse depth map, and an energy based fusion operation is exploited to effectively fuse these features obtained by channel shuffle operation, thus leading to more accurate and refined depth maps. We achieve SoTA performance in RMSE on KITTI benchmark. Extensive experiments on other datasets future demonstrate the superiority of our approach over current state-of-the-art depth completion approaches."}

We attempt to explain the real effect of Batch Normalization (BN) from the perspective of variance transmission by investigating the relationship between BN and Weights Normalization (WN). In this work, we demonstrate that the problem of the shift of the average gradient will amplify the variance of every convolutional (conv) layer. We propose Parametric Weights Standardization (PWS), a fast and robust to mini-batch size module used for conv filters, to solve the shift of the average gradient. PWS can provide the speed-up of BN. Besides, it has less computation and does not change the output of a conv layer. PWS enables the network to converge fast without normalizing the outputs. This result enhances the persuasiveness of the shift of the average gradient and explains why BN works from the perspective of variance transmission.

Due to the lack of frame-level annotations during training, current WS-TAL methods rely on attention mechanisms to localize the foreground snippets or frames that contribute to the video-level classification task. This strategy frequently confuse context with the actual action, in the localization result. Separating action and context is a core problem for precise WS-TAL, but it is very challenging and has been largely ignored in the literature. In this paper, we introduce an Action-Context Separation Network (ACSNet) that explicitly takes into account context for accurate action localization. It consists of two branches (i.e., the Foreground-Background branch and the Action-Context branch). The Foreground-Background branch first distinguishes foreground from background within the entire video while the Action-Context branch further separates the foreground as action and context. We associate video snippets with two latent components (i.e., a positive component and a negative component), and their different combinations can effectively characterize foreground, action and context. Furthermore, we introduce extended labels with auxiliary context categories to facilitate the learning of action-context separation.

This compositional approach allows us to reframe fine-grained recognition as zero-shot activity recognition,  where a detector is composed \"on the fly\" from simple first-principles state machines supported by deep-learned components.  We evaluate our method on the Olympic Sports and UCF101 datasets, where our model establishes a new state of the art under multiple experimental paradigms. We also extend this method to form a unique framework for zero-shot joint segmentation and classification of activities in video and demonstrate the first results in zero- shot decoding of complex action sequences on a widely-used surgical dataset.

Existing SRDA methods for LiDAR point cloud segmentation mainly employ a multi-stage pipeline and focus on feature-level alignment. They require prior knowledge of real-world statistics and ignore the pixel-level dropout noise gap and the spatial feature gap between different domains. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, named ePointDA, to address the above issues. Specifically, ePointDA consists of three modules: self-supervised dropout noise rendering, statistics-invariant and spatially-adaptive feature alignment, and transferable segmentation learning. The joint optimization enables ePointDA to bridge the domain shift at the pixel-level by explicitly rendering dropout noise for synthetic LiDAR and at the feature-level by spatially aligning the features between different domains, without requiring the real-world statistics.

Based on the rectified confidence, we further formulate the Distance-variant IoU-weighted NMS to obtain smoother regressions and avoid redundant predictions. We experiment CIA-SSD on 3D car detection in the KITTI test set and show that it attains top performance in terms of the official ranking metric (moderate AP 80.28%) and above 32 FPS inference speed, outperforming all prior single-stage detectors.

Two tasks -- text-based visual question answering and text-based image captioning, with a text extension from existing vision-language applications, are catching on rapidly.  To address these problems, many sophisticated multi-modality encoding frameworks (such as heterogeneous graph structure) are being used. In this paper, we argue that a simple attention mechanism can do the same or even better job without any bells and whistles. Under this mechanism, we simply split OCR token features into separate visual- and linguistic-attention branches, and send them to a popular Transformer decoder to generate answers or captions. Surprisingly, we find this simple baseline model is rather strong -- it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on two popular benchmarks, TextVQA and all three tasks of ST-VQA, although these SOTA models use far more complex encoding mechanisms. Transferring it to text-based image captioning, we also surpass the TextCaps Challenge 2020 winner. We wish this work to set the new baseline for these two OCR text related applications and to inspire  new thinking of multi-modality encoder design.

Existing methods typically predict the complete point cloud based on the global shape representation extracted from the incomplete input. Although they could predict the overall shape of 3D objects, they are incapable of generating structure details of objects. Moreover, the partial input point sets obtained from range scans are often sparse, noisy and non-uniform, which largely hinder shape completion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling and hierarchical folding network (ASHF-Net) for robust 3D point cloud completion. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a denoising auto-encoder with an adaptive sampling module, aiming at learning robust local region features that are insensitive to noise. Second, we propose a hierarchical folding decoder with the gated skip-attention and multi-resolution completion goal to effectively exploit the local structure details of partial inputs. We also design a KL regularization term to evenly distribute the generated points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple 3D point cloud completion benchmarks."}

It will inevitably cause the model to over-fit the data in the dominant position (e.g., head data in imbalanced class, easy samples or noisy samples). The latest resampling methods address the issue by designing specific criterion to select specific samples that trains the model generalize more on certain type of data (e.g., hard samples, tail data),  which is not adaptive to the inconsistent real world ReID data distributions.  Therefore, instead of simply presuming on what samples are generalizable, this paper proposes a one-for-more training objective that directly takes the generalization ability of selected samples as a loss function and learn a sampler to automatically select generalizable samples. More importantly, our proposed one-for-more based sampler can be seamlessly integrated into the ReID training framework which is able to simultaneously train ReID models and the sampler in an end-to-end fashion. The experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the ReID model training and boost the performance of ReID models."}

While most existing methods focus on designing novel architectures, we steer toward a different perspective: performing automated multi-loss adaptation (named Ada-Segment) on the fly to flexibly adjust multiple training losses over the course of training using a controller trained to capture the learning dynamics. This offers a few advantages: it bypasses manual tuning of the sensitive loss combination, a decisive factor for panoptic segmentation; allows to explicitly model the learning dynamics, and reconcile the learning of multiple objectives (up to ten in our experiments); with an end-to-end architecture, it generalizes to different datasets without the need of re-tuning hyperparameters or re-adjusting the training process laboriously. Our Ada-Segment brings 2.7% panoptic quality (PQ) improvement on COCO val split from the vanilla baseline, achieving the state-of-the-art 48.5% PQ on COCO test-dev split and 32.9% PQ on ADE20K dataset. The extensive ablation studies reveal the ever-changing dynamics throughout the training process, necessitating the incorporation of an automated and adaptive learning strategy as presented in this paper."}

But the high accuracy and fast inference speed are dominated by top-down methods and bottom-up methods respectively. To make a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose a novel multi-person pose estimation framework, SIngle-network with Mimicking and Point Learning for Bottom-up Human Pose Estimation (SIMPLE). Specifically, in the training process, we enable SIMPLE to mimic the pose knowledge from the high-performance top-down pipeline, which significantly promotes SIMPLE's accuracy while maintaining its high efficiency during inference. Besides, SIMPLE formulates human detection and pose estimation as a unified point learning framework to complement each other in single-network.  This is quite different from previous works where the two tasks may interfere with each other. To the best of our knowledge, both mimicking strategy between different method types and unified point learning are firstly proposed in pose estimation. In experiments, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance among bottom-up methods on the COCO, MPII and PoseTrack datasets. Compared with the top-down approaches, SIMPLE has comparable accuracy and faster inference speed."}

The major challenge of handling such irregular data is how to achieve the permutation invariance of points in the input. Most of existing methods extract local descriptors that encode the geometry of local structure, followed by a symmetric function to form a global representation. The max pooling usually serves as the symmetric function and shows slight superiority compared to the average pooling. We argue that some discrimination information is inevitably missing when applying the max pooling across all local descriptors. In this paper, we propose the BoW pooling, a plug-and-play unit to substitute the max pooling. Our BoW pooling analyzes the set of local descriptors statistically and generates a histogram that reflects how the primitives in the dictionary constitute the overall geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Bow pooling is efficient to improve the performance in point cloud classification, shape retrieval and segmentation tasks and outperforms other existing symmetric functions."}

Such direct feedback enhances the input by a  feature enrichment and fusion technique, which exploits andintegrates the global matching patterns from the deviation of the similarity permuted by the current matching estimate. As a result, the circulation enables the learning component to benefit from the optimization process, taking advantage of both global feature and  the embedding result which is calculated by local propagationthrough node-neighbors. Moreover, circulation consistency induces an unsupervised loss that can be implemented individually or jointly to regularize the supervised loss.

Though considerable progress has been made, for practical settings, there still exist challenges for rotating objects with large aspect ratio, dense distribution and category extremely imbalance. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end refined single-stage rotation detector for fast and accurate object detection by using a progressive regression approach from coarse to fine granularity. Considering the shortcoming of feature misalignment in existing refined single-stage detector, we design a feature refinement module to improve detection performance by getting more accurate features. The key idea of feature refinement module is to re-encode the position information of the current refined bounding box to the corresponding feature points through pixel-wise feature interpolation to realize feature reconstruction and alignment. For more accurate rotation estimation, an approximate SkewIoU loss is proposed to solve the problem that the calculation of SkewIoU is not derivable.

However, 3D networks can easily lead to over-parameterization which incurs expensive computation cost. In this paper, we propose Channel-wise Automatic KErnel Shrinking (CAKES), to enable efficient 3D learning by shrinking standard 3D convolutions into a set of economic operations (e.g., 1D, 2D convolutions). Unlike previous methods, CAKES performs channel-wise kernel shrinkage, which enjoys the following benefits: 1) enabling operations deployed in every layer to be heterogeneous, so that they can extract diverse and complementary information to benefit the learning process; and 2) allowing for an efficient and flexible replacement design, which can be generalized to both spatial-temporal and volumetric data. Further, we propose a new search space based on CAKES, so that the configuration can be determined automatically for simplifying 3D networks. CAKES shows superior performance to other methods with similar model size, and it also achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods with much fewer parameters and computational costs on tasks including 3D medical imaging segmentation and video action recognition.

Most of existing generation methods are based on the deep generative models, particularly, the generative adversarial networks (GAN) based models. However, these deep generative models may suffer from the mode collapse issue, which significantly degrades the diversity and quality of generated results. In this paper, we introduce a one-bit stroke encoding to capture the key mode information of Chinese characters and then incorporate it into CycleGAN, a popular deep generative model for Chinese font generation. As a result we propose an efficient method called StrokeGAN, mainly motivated by the observation that the stroke encoding contains amount of mode information of Chinese characters. In order to reconstruct the one-bit stroke encoding of the associated generated characters, we introduce a stroke-encoding reconstruction loss imposed on the discriminator. Equipped with such one-bit stroke encoding and stroke-encoding reconstruction loss, the mode collapse issue of CycleGAN can be significantly alleviated, with an improved preservation of strokes and diversity of generated characters. The effectiveness of StrokeGAN is demonstrated by a series of generation tasks over nine datasets with different fonts. The numerical results demonstrate that StrokeGAN generally outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of content and recognition accuracies, as well as certain stroke error, and also generates more realistic characters."}

On the other hand, existing works estimate illumination by either regressing light parameters or generating illumination maps that are often hard to optimize or tend to produce inaccurate predictions. We propose Earth Mover’s Light (EMLight), an illumination estimation framework that leverages a regression network and a neural projector for accurate illumination estimation. We decompose the illumination map into spherical light distribution, light intensity and the ambient term, and define the illumination estimation as a parameter regression task for the three illumination components. Motivated by the Earth Mover's distance, we design a novel spherical mover's loss that guides to regress light distribution parameters accurately by taking advantage of the subtleties of spherical distribution. Under the guidance of the predicted spherical distribution, light intensity and ambient term, the neural projector synthesizes panoramic illumination maps with realistic light frequency. Extensive experiments show that EMLight achieves accurate illumination estimation and the generated relighting in 3D object embedding exhibits superior plausibility and fidelity as compared with state-of-the-art methods."}

Moreover, a single perturbation, often called universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), can be generated to fool the DNN for most images. A similar misalignment phenomenon has also been observed in the deep steganography task, where a decoder network can retrieve a secret image back from a slightly perturbed cover image. We attempt explaining the success of both in a unified manner from the Fourier perspective. We perform task-specific and joint analysis and reveal that (a) frequency is a key factor that influences their performance based on the proposed entropy metric for quantifying the frequency distribution; (b) their success can be attributed to a DNN being highly sensitive to high-frequency content. We also perform feature layer analysis for providing deep insight on model generalization and robustness. Additionally, we propose two new variants of universal perturbations: (1) high-pass UAP (HP-UAP) being less visible to the human eye;  (2) Universal Secret Adversarial Perturbation (USAP) that simultaneously achieves attack and hiding."}

Rectification (i.e., spatial transformers) as the preprocessing stage is one popular approach and extensively studied. However, chromatic difficulties in complex scenes have not been paid much attention on. In this work, we introduce a new learnable geometric-unrelated rectification, Structure-Preserving Inner Offset Network (SPIN), which allows the color manipulation of source data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted before any recognition architecture to ease the downstream tasks, giving neural networks the ability to actively transform input intensity rather than only the spatial rectification. It can also serve as a complementary module to known spatial transformations and work in both independent and collaborative ways with them. Extensive experiments show the proposed transformation outperforms existing rectification networks and has comparable performance among the state-of-the-arts."}

State-of-the-art adversarial example detection methods characterize an input example as adversarial either by quantifying the magnitude of feature variations under multiple perturbations or by measuring its distance from estimated benign example distribution. Instead of using such metrics, the proposed method is based on the observation that the directions of adversarial gradients when crafting (new) adversarial examples play a key role in characterizing the adversarial space. Compared to detection methods that use multiple perturbations, the proposed method is efficient as it only applies a single random perturbation on the input example. Experiments conducted on two different databases, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, show that the proposed detection method achieves, respectively, 97.9% and 98.6% AUC-ROC (on average) on five different adversarial attacks, and outperforms multiple state-of-the-art detection methods.

The former aims to globally find the most attractive objects in an image, whereas the latter can be achieved only using local regions that contain salient objects. However, previous methods mainly accomplish the two tasks simultaneously in a simple end-to-end manner, which leads to the ignorance of the differences between them. We assume that the human vision system orderly locates and segments objects, so we propose a novel progressive architecture with knowledge review network (PA-KRN) for SOD. It consists of three parts. (1) A coarse locating module (CLM) that uses body-attention label locates rough areas containing salient objects without boundary details. (2) An attention-based sampler highlights salient object regions with high resolution based on body-attention maps. (3) A fine segmenting module (FSM) finely segments salient objects. The networks applied in CLM and FSM are mainly based on our proposed knowledge review network (KRN) that utilizes the finest feature maps to reintegrate all previous layers, which can make up for the important information that is continuously diluted in the top-down path. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our single KRN can outperform state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our PA-KRN performs better and substantially surpasses the aforementioned methods."}

First, an imagine module is leveraged to learn the imaginative storyline explicitly, improving the coherence and reasonability of the generated story. Second, we employ a reason module to fully exploit the external knowledge (commonsense knowledge base) and task-specific knowledge (scene graph and event graph) with relational reasoning method based on the storyline. In this way, we can effectively capture the most informative commonsense and visual relationships among objects in images, which enhances the diversity and informativeness of the generated story. Finally, we integrate the imaginary concepts and relational knowledge to generate human-like story based on the original semantics of images.

Generally, these videos are presented on video streaming sites with image thumbnails and text titles. While facing huge amounts of videos, a viewer clicks through a certain video with high probability because of its eye-catching thumbnail. However, current video thumbnails are created manually, which is time-consuming and quality-unguaranteed. And static image thumbnails contain very limited information of the corresponding videos, which prevents users from successfully clicking what they really want to view.    In this paper, we address a novel problem, namely GIF thumbnail generation, which aims to automatically generate GIF thumbnails for videos and consequently boost their Click-Through-Rate (CTR). Here, a GIF thumbnail is an animated GIF file consisting of multiple segments from the video, containing more information of the target video than a static image thumbnail. To support this study, we build the first GIF thumbnails benchmark dataset that consists of 1070 videos covering a total duration of 69.1 hours, and 5394 corresponding manually-annotated GIFs. To solve this problem, we propose a learning-based automatic GIF thumbnail generation model, which is called Generative Variational Dual-Encoder (GEVADEN).  As not relying on any user interaction information (e.g. time-sync comments and real-time view counts), this model is applicable to newly-uploaded/rarely-viewed videos. Experiments on our built dataset show that GEVADEN significantly outperforms several baselines, including video-summarization and highlight-detection based ones. Furthermore, we develop a pilot application of the proposed model on an online video platform with 9814 videos covering 1231 hours, which shows that our model achieves a 37.5% CTR improvement over traditional image thumbnails. This further validates the effectiveness of the proposed model and the promising application prospect of GIF thumbnails."}

However, existing text spotters are mostly built on two-stage frameworks or character-based methods, which suffer from either Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), Region-of-Interest (RoI) operations, or character-level annotations. In this paper, to address the above problems, we propose a novel fully convolutional Point Gathering Network (PGNet) for reading arbitrarily-shaped text in real-time. The PGNet is a single-shot text spotter, where the pixel-level character classification map is learned with proposed PG-CTC loss avoiding the usage of character-level annotations. With a PG-CTC decoder, we gather high-level character classification vectors from two-dimensional space and decode them into text symbols without NMS and RoI operations involved, which guarantees high efficiency. Additionally, reasoning the relations between each character and its neighbors, a graph refinement module (GRM) is proposed to optimize the coarse recognition and improve the end-to-end performance. Experiments prove that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy, meanwhile significantly improving the running speed. In particular, in Total-Text, it runs at 46.7 FPS, surpassing the previous spotters with a large margin."}

However, their performance is far from satisfactory with sparse instance annotations. Most existing methods for sparsely annotated object detection either re-weight the loss of hard negative samples or convert the unlabeled instances into ignored regions to reduce the interference of false negatives. We argue that these strategies are insufficient since they can at most alleviate the negative effect caused by missing annotations. In this  paper, we propose a simple but effective mechanism, called Co-mining, for sparsely annotated object detection. In our Co-mining, two branches of a siamese network predict the pseudo-label sets for each other. To enhance multi-view learning and better mine unlabeled instances, the original image and corresponding augmented image are used as the inputs of two branches of the siamese network, respectively. Co-mining can serve as a general training mechanism applied to most of modern object detectors. Experiments are performed on MS COCO dataset with three different sparsely annotated settings using two typical frameworks: anchor-based detector RetinaNet and anchor-free detector FCOS. Experimental results show that our Co-mining with RetinaNet achieves 1.4%∼2.1% improvements compared with different baselines and surpasses existing methods under the same sparsely annotated setting."}

Generally, current datasets: 1) are limited in scale; 2) built under simple and constrained conditions, where the number of disturbing non-VIPs is not large, the scene is relatively simple, and the face of VIP is always in frontal view and salient. To tackle these problems, the proposed Unconstrained-7k dataset is featured in two aspects. First, it contains over 7,000 annotated images, making it the largest VIPLoc dataset  under unconstrained conditions to date. Second, our dataset is collected freely on the Internet, including multiple scenes, where images are in unconstrained conditions. VIPs in the new dataset are in different settings, e.g., large view variation, varying sizes, occluded, and complex scenes. Meanwhile, each image has more persons (> 20), making the dataset more challenging.  As a minor contribution, motivated by the observation that VIPs are highly related to not only neighbors but also iconic objects, this paper proposes a Joint Social Relation and Individual Interaction Graph Neural Networks (JSRII-GNN) for VIPLoc.

In particular, high curvature regions are not always represented accurately by methods trained with common set-based loss functions such as Chamfer Distance, resulting in reconstructions short-circuiting the surface or \"cutting corners.\" To address this issue, we propose an approach to 3D reconstruction that embeds points on the surface of an object into a higher-dimensional space that captures both the original 3D surface as well as geodesic distances between points on the surface of the object. The precise specification of these additional \"lifted\" coordinates ultimately yields useful surface information without requiring excessive additional computation during either training or testing, in comparison with existing approaches. Our experiments show that taking advantage of these learned lifted coordinates yields better performance for estimating surface normals and generating surfaces than using point cloud reconstructions alone. Further, we find that this learned geodesic embedding space provides useful information for applications such as unsupervised object decomposition."}

Although existing GAN-based HVMT methods have achieved great success, they either fail to preserve appearance details due to the loss of spatial consistency between synthesized and exemplary images, or generate incoherent video results due to the lack of temporal consistency among video frames. In this paper, we propose Coarse-to-Fine Flow Warping Network (C2F-FWN) for spatial-temporal consistent HVMT. Particularly, C2F-FWN utilizes coarse-to-fine flow warping and Layout-Constrained Deformable Convolution (LC-DConv) to improve spatial consistency, and employs Flow Temporal Consistency (FTC) Loss to enhance temporal consistency. In addition, provided with multi-source appearance inputs, C2F-FWN can support appearance attribute editing with great flexibility and efficiency. Besides public datasets, we also collected a large-scale HVMT dataset named SoloDance for evaluation. Extensive experiments conducted on our SoloDance dataset and the iPER dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-art HVMT methods in terms of both spatial and temporal consistency.

We show that imperceptible additive perturbations can significantly alter the disparity map, and correspondingly the perceived geometry of the scene. These perturbations not only affect the specific model they are crafted for, but transfer to models with different architecture, trained with different loss functions. We show that, when used for adversarial data augmentation, our perturbations result in trained models that are more robust, without sacrificing overall accuracy of the model. This is unlike what has been observed in image classification, where adding the perturbed images to the training set makes the model less vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, but to the detriment of overall accuracy. We test our method using the most recent stereo networks and evaluate their performance on public benchmark datasets."}

The encoder-decoder framework is widely used to solve this image-to-sequence problem. However, (i) for structured mathematical formula, the hierarchical structure neither in the formula nor in the markup has been explored adequately. In addition, (ii) existing image-to-markup methods could not explicitly segment mathematical symbols in the formula corresponding to each target markup token. In this paper, we address the above issues by formulating the HMER as a graph-to-graph (G2G) learning problem. Graph is more flexible and general for structure representation and learning compared with image or sequence. At the core of our method lies the embedding of input formula and output markup into graphs on primitives, with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to explore the structural information, and a novel sub-graph attention mechanism to match primitives in the input and output graphs. We conduct extensive experiments on CROHME datasets to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed G2G model. Our method yields significant improvements over previous SOTA image-to-markup systems. Moreover, it explicitly resolves the symbol segmentation problem while still being trained end-to-end, making the whole system much more accurate and interpretable."}

Existing state-of-the-art methods have achieved excellent accuracy regardless of the complexity meanwhile efficient spatiotemporal modeling solutions are slightly inferior in performance. In this paper, we attempt to acquire both efficiency and effectiveness simultaneously. First of all, besides traditionally treating H x W x T video frames as space-time signal (viewing from the Height-Width spatial plane), we propose to also model video from the other two Height-Time and Width-Time planes, to capture the dynamics of video thoroughly. Secondly, our model is designed based on 2D CNN backbones and model complexity is well kept in mind by design. Specifically, we introduce a novel multi-view fusion (MVF) module to exploit video dynamics using separable convolution for efficiency. It is a plug-and-play module and can be inserted into off-the-shelf 2D CNNs to form a simple yet effective model called MVFNet. Moreover, MVFNet can be thought of as a generalized video modeling framework and it can specialize to be existing methods such as C2D, SlowOnly, and TSM under different settings. Extensive experiments are conducted on popular benchmarks (i.e., Something-Something V1 & V2, Kinetics, UCF-101, and HMDB-51) to show its superiority.

However, previous MMT models and probing studies on visual features suggest that visual information is less explored in MMT as it is often redundant to textual information. In this paper, we propose an Object-level Visual Context modeling framework (OVC) to efficiently capture and explore visual information for multimodal machine translation. With detected objects, the proposed OVC encourages MMT to ground translation on desirable visual objects by masking irrelevant objects in the visual modality. We equip the proposed with an additional object-masking loss to achieve this goal. The object-masking loss is estimated according to the similarity between masked objects and the source texts so as to encourage masking source-irrelevant objects. Additionally, in order to generate vision-consistent target words, we further propose a vision-weighted translation loss for OVC. Experiments on MMT datasets demonstrate that the proposed OVC model outperforms state-of-the-art MMT models and analyses show that masking irrelevant objects helps grounding in MMT."}

Most existing works decoupled this problem into several independent sub-tasks of text spotting (text detection and recognition) and information extraction, which completely ignored the high correlation among them during optimization. In this paper, we propose a robust Visual Information Extraction System (VIES) towards real-world scenarios, which is an unified end-to-end trainable framework for simultaneous text detection, recognition and information extraction by taking a single document image as input and outputting the structured information. Specifically, the information extraction branch collects abundant visual and semantic representations from text spotting for multimodal feature fusion and conversely, provides higher-level semantic clues to contribute to the optimization of text spotting. Moreover, regarding the shortage of public benchmarks, we construct a fully-annotated dataset called EPHOIE (https://github.com/HCIILAB/EPHOIE), which is the first Chinese benchmark for both text spotting and visual information extraction. EPHOIE consists of 1,494 images of examination paper head with complex layouts and background, including a total of 15,771 Chinese handwritten or printed text instances.

SSAT, however, is limited by its descriptive power within the PSPACE complexity class. More complex problems, such as the NEXPTIME-complete Decentralized POMDP (Dec-POMDP), cannot be succinctly encoded with SSAT. To provide a logical formalism of such problems, we generalize the Dependency Quantified Boolean Formula (DQBF), a representative problem in the NEXPTIME-complete class, to its stochastic variant, named Dependency SSAT (DSSAT), and show that DSSAT is also NEXPTIME-complete. We demonstrate the potential applications of DSSAT to circuit synthesis of probabilistic and approximate design. Furthermore, to study the descriptive power of DSSAT, we establish a polynomial-time reduction from Dec-POMDP to DSSAT.

These two components of our architecture are used as the objective function and surrogate hard constraints in a constrained optimization for collision-free human pose generation. A novel aspect of our approach is the use of a bilevel autoencoder that decomposes whole-body collisions into groups of collisions between localized body parts. By solving the constrained optimizations, we show that a significant amount of collision artifacts can be resolved. Furthermore, in a large test set of 2.5 × 10 6 randomized poses from SCAPE, our architecture achieves a collision-prediction accuracy of 94.1% with 80× speedup over exact collision detection algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, LCollision is the ﬁrst approach that accelerates collision detection and resolves penetrations using a neural network."}

Existing approaches typically apply constrained optimization techniques to ML training, enforce constraint satisfaction by adjusting the model design, or use constraints to correct the output. Here, we investigate a different, complementary, strategy based on \"teaching\" constraint satisfaction to a supervised ML method via the direct use of a state-of-the-art constraint solver: this enables taking advantage of decades of research on constrained optimization with limited effort. In practice, we use a decomposition scheme alternating master steps (in charge of enforcing the constraints) and learner steps (where any supervised ML model and training algorithm can be employed). The process leads to approximate constraint satisfaction in general, and convergence properties are difficult to establish; despite this fact, we found empirically that even a naive setup of our approach performs well on ML tasks with fairness constraints, and on classical datasets with synthetic constraints."}

Cardinality constraints require significant work to be re-encoded to SAT, and SAT solvers are notoriously weak at cardinality reasoning.  In this work, we lift core-guided search to pseudo-Boolean (PB) solvers, which deal with more general PB optimization problems and operate natively with cardinality constraints. The cutting planes method used in such solvers allows us to derive stronger cardinality constraints, which yield better updates to solution bounds, and the increased efficiency of objective function reformulation also makes it feasible to switch repeatedly between lower-bounding and upper- bounding search. A thorough evaluation on applied and crafted benchmarks shows that our core-guided PB solver significantly improves on the state of the art in pseudo-Boolean optimization."}

In most stochastic matching problems, the probability distributions inherent in the nodes and edges are set a priori, and are not controllable. However, many matching services have options, which we call control variables, that affect the probability distributions and thus what constitutes an optimum matching. Although several methods for optimizing the values of the control variables have been developed, their optimization in consideration of the matching problem is still in its infancy. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem for determining the values of the control variables so as to maximize the expected value of matching weights. Since this problem involves hard to evaluate objective values and is non-convex, we construct an approximation algorithm via a minimum-cost flow algorithm that can find 3-approximation solutions rapidly. Simulations on real data from a ride-hailing platform and a crowd-sourcing market show that the proposed method can find solutions with high profits of the service provider in practical time."}

Since such temporal knowledge graphs often suffer from incompleteness, it is important to develop time-aware representation learning models that help to infer the missing temporal facts. While the temporal facts are typically evolving, it is observed that many facts often show a repeated pattern along the timeline, such as economic crises and diplomatic activities. This observation indicates that a model could potentially learn much from the known facts appeared in history. To this end, we propose a new representation learning model for temporal knowledge graphs, namely CyGNet, based on a novel time-aware copy-generation mechanism. CyGNet is not only able to predict future facts from the whole entity vocabulary, but also capable of identifying facts with repetition and accordingly predicting such future facts with reference to the known facts in the past. We evaluate the proposed method on the knowledge graph completion task using five benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CyGNet for predicting future facts with repetition as well as de novo fact prediction."}

We model such tuples as entries in a streaming tensor, which augments attribute sizes in its modes over time. Synchronized behavior tends to form dense blocks (i.e.~subtensors) in such a tensor, signaling anomalous behavior, or interesting communities. However, existing dense block detection methods are either based on a static tensor, or lack an efficient algorithm in a streaming setting. Therefore, we propose a fast streaming algorithm, AUGSPLICING, which can detect the top dense blocks by incrementally splicing the previous detection with the incoming ones in new tuples, avoiding re-runs over all the history data at every tracking time step. AUGSPLICING is based on a splicing condition that guides the algorithm (Section 4). Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method is (1) effective to detect fraudulent behavior in installing data of real-world apps and find a synchronized group of students with interesting features in campus Wi-Fi data; (2) robust with splicing theory for dense block detection; (3) streaming and faster than the existing streaming algorithm, with closely comparable accuracy."}

Multi-Hop reasoning is a typical sequential decision problem, which can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). Subsequently, some reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches are proposed and proven effective to train an agent for reasoning paths sequentially until reaching the target answer. However, these approaches assume that an entity/relation representation follows a one-point distribution. In fact, different entities and relations may contain different certainties. On the other hand, since REINFORCE used for updating the policy in these approaches is a biased policy gradients method, the agent is prone to be stuck in high reward paths rather than broad reasoning paths, which leads to premature and suboptimal exploitation. In this paper, we consider a Bayesian reinforcement learning paradigm to harness uncertainty into multi-hop reasoning. By incorporating uncertainty into the representation layer, the agent trained by RL has uncertainty in a region of the state space then it should be more efficient in exploring unknown or less known part of the KG. In our approach, we build a Bayesian Q-learning architecture as a state-action value function for estimating the expected long-term reward. As initialized by Gaussian prior or pre-trained prior distribution, the representation layer drives uncertainty that allows regularizing the training. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple KGs. Experimental results show a superior performance than other baselines, especially significant improvements on the automated extracted KG."}

In this paper, we propose a novel model, named GSNet, to learn the spatial-temporal correlations from geographical and semantic aspects for traffic accident risk forecasting. In the model, a Spatial-Temporal Geographical Module is designed to capture the geographical spatial-temporal correlations among regions, while a Spatial-Temporal Semantic Module is proposed to model the semantic spatial-temporal correlations among regions. In addition, a weighted loss function is designed to solve the zero-inflated issue.

Human mobility is a sequential decision-making process dependent on the users' dynamic interests. With accurate user profiles, the predictive model can perfectly reproduce users' mobility trajectories. In the reverse direction, once the predictive model can imitate users' mobility patterns, the learned user profiles are also optimal. Such intuition motivates us to propose an imitation-based mobile user profiling framework by exploiting reinforcement learning, in which the agent is trained to precisely imitate users' mobility patterns for optimal user profiles. Specifically, the proposed framework includes two modules: (1) representation module, that produces state combining user profiles and spatio-temporal context in real-time; (2) imitation module, where Deep Q-network (DQN) imitates the user behavior (action) based on the state that is produced by the representation module. However, there are two challenges in running the framework effectively. First, epsilon-greedy strategy in DQN makes use of the exploration-exploitation trade-off by randomly pick actions with the epsilon probability. Such randomness feeds back to the representation module, causing the learned user profiles unstable. To solve the problem, we propose an adversarial training strategy to guarantee the robustness of the representation module. Second, the representation module updates users' profiles in an incremental manner, requiring integrating the temporal effects of user profiles. Inspired by Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), we introduce a gated mechanism to incorporate new and old user characteristics into the user profile. In the experiment, we evaluate our proposed framework on real-world datasets. The extensive experimental results validate the superiority of our method comparing to baseline algorithms."}

The human movements can be viewed as a dynamic process that human transits between states (e.g., locations) over time. In the human world where intelligent agents like humans or vehicles with human drivers play an important role, the states of agents mostly describe human activities, and the state transition is influenced by both the human decisions and physical constraints from the real-world system (e.g., agents need to spend time to move over a certain distance). Therefore, the modeling of state transition should include the modeling of the agent's decision process and the physical system dynamics.  In this paper, we propose MoveSD to model state transition in human movement from a novel perspective, by learning the decision model and integrating the system dynamics. MoveSD learns the human movement with Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning and integrates the stochastic constraints from system dynamics in the learning process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to learn to model the state transition of moving agents with system dynamics. In extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method can generate trajectories similar to real-world ones, and outperform the state-of-the-art methods in predicting the next location and generating long-term future trajectories."}

Nevertheless, compared with mobility data from transportation systems like the GPS module in taxis, this kind of data is commonly sparse in terms of individual trajectories in the sense that users do not access mobile services and contribute their data all the time. Consequently, the sparsity inevitably weakens the practical value of the data even it has a high user penetration rate. To solve this problem, we propose a novel attentional neural network-based model, named AttnMove, to densify individual trajectories by recovering unobserved locations at a fine-grained spatial-temporal resolution. To tackle the challenges posed by sparsity, we design various intra- and inter- trajectory attention mechanisms to better model the mobility regularity of users and fully exploit the periodical pattern from long-term history. We evaluate our model on two real-world datasets, and extensive results demonstrate the performance gain compared with the state-of-the-art methods. This also shows that, by providing high-quality mobility data, our model can benefit a variety of mobility-oriented down-stream applications."}

Different from traditional loans with mortgage, online consumer loans only take personal credit as collateral for loans. Consequently, loan fraud detection is particularly critical for lenders to avoid economic loss. Previous methods mainly leverage applicant's attributes and historical behavior for loan fraud detection. Although these methods gain success at detecting potential charge-offs, yet they perform worse when multiple persons with various roles (e.g., sellers, intermediaries) collude to apply fraudulent loan. To combat this challenge, we consider the problem of loan fraud detection via exploiting roles of users and multi-type social relationships among users. We propose a novel Graph neural network with a Role-constrained Conditional random field, namely GRC, to learn the representation of applicants and detect loan fraud based on the learned representation. The proposed model characterizes the multiple types of relationships via self-attention mechanism and employs conditional random field to constrain users with the same role to have similar representation.

To carry out machine learning on HINs, meta-paths are widely utilized to extract semantics with pre-defined patterns, and models such as graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are thus enabled. However, previous works generally assume a fixed set of meta-paths, which is unrealistic as real-world data are overwhelmingly diverse. Therefore, it is appealing if meta-paths can be automatically selected given an HIN, yet existing works aiming at such problem possess drawbacks, such as poor efficiency and ignoring feature heterogeneity. To address these drawbacks, we propose GraphMSE, an efficient heterogeneous GCN combined with automatic meta-path selection. Specifically, we design highly efficient meta-path sampling techniques, and then injectively project sampled meta-path instances to vectors. We then design a novel semantic feature space alignment, aiming to align the meta-path instance vectors and hence facilitate meta-path selection. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphMSE outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts, figures out important meta-paths, and is dramatically (e.g. 200 times) more efficient."}

Notice that, besides the sensitive information of a specific rating score assigned to a certain item by a user, the information of a user's rated set of items shall also be well protected. Some very recent works propose to randomly sample some unrated items for each user and then assign some virtual ratings, so that the server can not identify the scores and the set of rated items easily during the server-client interactions. However, the virtual ratings assigned to the randomly sampled items will inevitably introduce some noise to the model training process, which will then cause loss in recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel lossless federated recommendation method (FedRec++) by allocating some denoising clients (i.e., users) to eliminate the noise in a privacy-aware manner. We further analyse our FedRec++ in terms of security and losslessness, and discuss its generality in the context of existing works. Extensive empirical studies clearly show the effectiveness of our FedRec++ in providing accurate and privacy-aware recommendation without much additional communication cost."}

Existing solutions usually explore sequence-to-sequence models to generate expressions, where the problems are simply encoded sequentially. However, such models are generally far from enough for understanding problems as similar to humans and lead to incorrect answers. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Math Solver (HMS) to make deep understanding and exploitation of problems. In problem understanding, imitating human reading habits, we propose a hierarchical word-clause-problem encoder. Specifically, we first split each problem into several clauses and learn problem semantics from the local clause level to the global problem level. Then, in clause understanding, we propose a dependency-based module to enhance clause semantics with the dependency structure of the problem. Next, in expression inference, we propose a novel tree-based decoder to generate the mathematical expression for the answer. In the decoder, we apply a hierarchical attention mechanism to enhance the problem semantics with context from different levels, and a pointer-generator network to guide the model to copy existing information and infer extra knowledge. Extensive experimental results on two widely used datasets demonstrate that HMS achieves not only better answers but also more reasonable inference."}

User representation is generally learned from behavior data, such as clicking interactions and review comments. However, for less popular domains, the behavior data is insufficient to learn precise user representations. To deal with this problem, a natural thought is to leverage content-rich domains to complement user representations. Inspired by the recent success of BERT in NLP, we propose a novel pre-training and fine-tuning based approach U-BERT. Different from typical BERT applications, U-BERT is customized for recommendation and utilizes different frameworks in pre-training and fine-tuning. In pre-training, U-BERT focuses on content-rich domains and introduces a user encoder and a review encoder to model users' behaviors. Two pre-training strategies are proposed to learn the general user representations; In fine-tuning, U-BERT focuses on the target content-insufficient domains. In addition to the user and review encoders inherited from the pre-training stage, U-BERT further introduces an item encoder to model item representations. Besides, a review co-matching layer is proposed to capture more semantic interactions between the reviews of the user and item. Finally, U-BERT combines user representations, item representations and review interaction information to improve recommendation performance. Experiments on six benchmark datasets from different domains demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of U-BERT."}

To this end, we propose a novel Neural Attentional Cooperation-competition model (NeuralAC), which incorporates weighted-cooperation effects (i.e., intra-team interactions) and weighted-competition effects (i.e., inter-team interactions) for predicting match outcomes. Specifically, we first project individuals to latent vectors and learn complex interactions through deep neural networks. Then, we design two novel attention-based mechanisms to capture the importance of intra-team and inter-team interactions, which enhance NeuralAC with both accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, we demonstrate NeuralAC can generalize several previous works. To evaluate the performances of NeuralAC, we conduct extensive experiments on four E-sports datasets. The experimental results clearly verify the effectiveness of NeuralAC compared with several state-of-the-art methods."}

Deep neural networks (DNNs) can dig out the underlying distribution of hyperspectral data but are limited by the labeling of large-scale hyperspectral datasets, especially the low spatial resolution of hyperspectral data, which makes labeling more difficult. To tackle this problem while ensuring the detection performance, we present an unsupervised low-rank embedded network (LREN) in this paper. LREN is a joint learning network in which the latent representation is specifically designed for HAD, rather than merely as a feature input for the detector. And it searches the lowest rank representation based on a representative and discriminative dictionary in the deep latent space to estimate the residual efficiently. Considering the physically mixing properties in hyperspectral imaging, we develop a trainable density estimation module based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in the deep latent space to construct a dictionary that can better characterize the complex hyperspectral images (HSIs). The closed-form solution of the proposed low-rank learner surpasses existing approaches on four real hyperspectral datasets with different anomalies. We argue that this unified framework paves a novel way to combine feature extraction and anomaly estimation-based methods for HAD, which intends to learn the underlying representation tailored for HAD without the prerequisite of manually labeled data.

The user check-in history used as the input to POI recommendation is very imbalanced and noisy because of sparse and missing check-ins. Although sample reweighting is commonly adopted for addressing this challenge with the input data, its fixed weighting scheme is often inappropriate to deal with different characteristics of users or POIs. Thus, in this paper, we propose PREMERE, an adaptive weighting scheme based on meta-learning. Because meta-data is typically required by meta-learning but is inherently hard to obtain in POI recommendation, we self-generate the meta-data via self-ensembling. Furthermore, the meta-model architecture is extended to deal with the scarcity of check-ins. Thorough experiments show that replacing a weighting scheme with PREMERE boosts the performance of the state-of-the-art recommender algorithms by 2.36–26.9% on three benchmark datasets."}

Observing the existing embedding methods may discard the uncertainty information, only incorporate a specific type of score function, or cause many false-negative samples in the training, we propose the PASSLEAF framework to solve the above issues. PASSLEAF consists of two parts, one is a model that can incorporate different types of scoring functions to predict the relation confidence scores and the other is the semi-supervised learning model by exploiting both positive and negative samples associated with the estimated confidence scores. Furthermore, PASSLEAF leverages a sample pool as a relay of generated samples to further augment the semi-supervised learning. Experiment results show that our proposed framework can learn better embedding in terms of having higher accuracy in both the confidence score prediction and tail entity prediction."}

However, biases in the text written for members of different subgroups (such as in recommendation letters for male and non-male candidates), though widely reported anecdotally, remain challenging to quantify. In this work, we introduce a novel framework to quantify bias in text caused by the visibility of subgroup membership indicators. We develop a nonparametric estimation and inference procedure to estimate this bias. We then formalize an identification strategy to causally link the estimated bias to the visibility of subgroup membership indicators, provided observations from time periods both before and after an identity-hiding policy change. We identify an application wherein “ground truth” bias can be inferred to evaluate our framework, instead of relying on synthetic or secondary data. Specifically, we apply our framework to quantify biases in the text of peer reviews from a reputed machine-learning conference before and after the conference adopted a double-blind reviewing policy. We show evidence of biases in the review ratings that serves as “ground truth”, and show that our proposed framework accurately detects the presence (and absence) of these biases from the review text without having access to the review ratings."}

When a peer-assessment task is competitive (e.g., when students are graded on a curve), agents may be incentivized to misreport evaluations in order to improve their own final standing. Our focus is on designing methods  for detection of such manipulations. Specifically, we consider a setting in which agents evaluate a subset of their peers and output rankings that are later aggregated to form a final ordering. In this paper, we investigate a statistical framework for this problem and design a principled test for detecting strategic behaviour. We prove that our test has strong false alarm guarantees and evaluate its detection ability in practical settings. For this, we design and conduct an experiment that elicits strategic behaviour from subjects and release a dataset of patterns of strategic behaviour that may be of independent interest. We use this data to run a series of real and semi-synthetic evaluations that reveal a strong detection power of our test."}

This resulted in urgent and large needs of ICUs posed great risks to the medical system. Estimating the mortality of critical in-patients who were not admitted into the ICU will be valuable to optimize the management and assignment of ICU. Retrospective, 733 in-patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at a local hospital (Wuhan, China), as of March 18, 2020. Demographic, clinical and laboratory results were collected and analyzed using machine learning to build a predictive model. Considering the shortage of ICU beds at the beginning of disease emergence, we defined the mortality for those patients who were predicted to be in needing ICU care yet they did not as Missing-ICU (MI)-mortality. To estimate MI-mortality, a prognostic classification model was built to identify the in-patients who may need ICU care. Its predictive accuracy was 0.8288, with an AUC of 0.9119. On our cohort of 733 patients, 25 in-patients who have been predicted by our model that they should need ICU, yet they did not enter ICU due to lack of shorting ICU wards.

In this work, we develop a tensor method to predict the evolution of epidemic trends for many regions simultaneously. We construct a 3-way spatio-temporal tensor (location, attribute, time) of case counts and propose a nonnegative tensor factorization with latent epidemiological model regularization named STELAR. Unlike standard tensor factorization methods which cannot predict slabs ahead, STELAR enables long-term prediction by incorporating latent temporal regularization through a system of discrete-time difference equations of a widely adopted epidemiological model. We use latent instead of location/attribute-level epidemiological dynamics to capture common epidemic profile sub-types and improve collaborative learning and prediction. We conduct experiments using  both county- and state-level COVID-19 data and show that our model can identify interesting latent patterns of the epidemic. Finally, we evaluate the predictive ability of our method and show superior performance compared to the baselines, achieving up to 21% lower root mean square error and 25% lower mean absolute error for county-level prediction."}

Deep-learning-based computer-aided screening, e.g., COVID-19 infected CT area segmentation, has attracted much attention. However, the publicly available COVID-19 training data are limited, easily causing overfitting for traditional deep learning methods that are usually data-hungry with millions of parameters. On the other hand, fast training/testing and low computational cost are also necessary for quick deployment and development of COVID-19 screening systems, but traditional deep learning methods are usually computationally intensive. To address the above problems, we propose MiniSeg, a lightweight deep learning model for efficient COVID-19 segmentation. Compared with traditional segmentation methods, MiniSeg has several significant strengths: i) it only has 83K parameters and is thus not easy to overfit; ii) it has high computational efficiency and is thus convenient for practical deployment; iii) it can be fast retrained by other users using their private COVID-19 data for further improving performance. In addition, we build a comprehensive COVID-19 segmentation benchmark for comparing MiniSeg to traditional methods."}

However, effective influenza forecasting still remains a challenge despite increasing research interest. It is even more challenging amidst the COVID pandemic, when the influenza-like illness (ILI) counts are affected by various factors such as symptomatic similarities with COVID-19 and shift in healthcare seeking patterns of the general population. Under the current pandemic, historical influenza models carry valuable expertise about the disease dynamics but face difficulties adapting. Therefore, we propose CALI-Net, a neural transfer learning architecture which allows us to 'steer' a historical disease forecasting model to new scenarios where flu and COVID co-exist. Our framework enables this adaptation by automatically learning when it should emphasize learning from COVID-related signals and when it should learn from the historical model. Thus, we exploit representations learned from historical ILI data as well as the limited COVID-related signals. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is successful in adapting a historical forecasting model to the current pandemic. In addition, we show that success in our primary goal, adaptation, does not sacrifice overall performance as compared with state-of-the-art influenza forecasting approaches."}

Collecting such datasets is time-consuming and expensive. Until now, very few annotated COVID-19 imaging datasets are available. Although self-supervised learning enables us to bootstrap the training by exploiting  unlabeled data, the generic self-supervised methods for natural images do not sufficiently incorporate the context. For medical images, a desirable method should be sensitive enough to detect deviation from normal-appearing tissue of each anatomical region; here, anatomy is the context. We introduce a novel approach with two levels of self-supervised representation learning objectives: one on the regional anatomical level and another on the patient-level. We use graph neural networks to incorporate the relationship between different anatomical regions. The structure of the graph is informed by anatomical correspondences between each patient and an anatomical atlas. In addition, the graph representation has the advantage of handling any arbitrarily sized image in full resolution. Experiments on large-scale Computer Tomography (CT) datasets of lung images show that our approach compares favorably to baseline methods that do not account for the context. We use the learnt embedding to quantify the clinical progression of COVID-19 and show that our method generalizes well to COVID-19 patients from different hospitals. Qualitative results suggest that our model can identify clinically relevant regions in the images."}

Existing solution for nonpharmaceutical interventions usually needs to timely and precisely select a subset of residential urban areas for containment or even quarantine, where the spatial distribution of confirmed cases has been considered as a key criterion for the subset selection. While such containment measure has successfully stopped or slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in some countries, it is criticized for being inefficient or ineffective, as the statistics of confirmed cases are usually time-delayed and coarse-grained. To tackle the issues, we propose C-Watcher, a novel data-driven framework that aims at screening every neighborhood in a target city and predicting infection risks, prior to the spread of COVID-19 from epicenters to the city. In terms of design, C-Watcher collects large-scale long-term human mobility data from Baidu Maps, then characterizes every residential neighborhood in the city using a set of features based on urban mobility patterns. Furthermore, to transfer the firsthand knowledge (witted in epicenters) to the target city before local outbreaks, we adopt a novel adversarial encoder framework to learn “city-invariant” representations from the mobility-related features for precise early detection of high-risk neighborhoods, even before any confirmed cases known, in the target city. We carried out extensive experiments on C-Watcher using the real-data records in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreaks, where the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of C-Watcher for early detection of high-risk neighborhoods from a large number of cities."}

For many applications, the desired outputs are the composition of externally-defined bases.  For such decomposable domains, we present a two-stage learning procedure producing combinations of the external bases which are trivially extractable from the network. In the first stage, the set of external bases that will form the solution are modeled as differentiable generator modules, controlled by the same parameters as the external bases.  In the second stage, a controller network is created that selects parameters for those generators, either successively or in parallel, to compose the final solution.  Through three tasks, we concretely demonstrate how our system yields readily understandable commands.  In one, we introduce a new form of artistic style transfer, learning to draw and color with crayons, in which the transformation of a photograph or painting occurs not as a single monolithic computation, but by the composition of thousands of individual, visualizable strokes.  The other two tasks, single-pass function approximation with arbitrary bases and shape-based synthesis, show how our approach produces understandable and extractable actions in two disparate domains."}

In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a weakly-supervised paradigm for learning MWPs. Our method only requires the annotations of the final answers and can generate various solutions for a single problem. To boost weakly-supervised learning, we propose a novel learning-by-fixing (LBF) framework, which corrects the misperceptions of the neural network via symbolic reasoning. Specifically, for an incorrect solution tree generated by the neural network, the fixing mechanism propagates the error from the root node to the leaf nodes and infers the most probable fix that can be executed to get the desired answer. To generate more diverse solutions, tree regularization is applied to guide the efficient shrinkage and exploration of the solution space, and a memory buffer is designed to track and save the discovered various fixes for each problem. Experimental results on the Math23K dataset show the proposed LBF framework significantly outperforms reinforcement learning baselines in weakly-supervised learning. Furthermore, it achieves comparable top-1 and much better top-3/5 answer accuracies than fully-supervised methods, demonstrating its strength in producing diverse solutions."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2021", "Area": "AI", "Where": "AAAI", "Abbreviation": "Classification by Attention", "Title": "Scene Graph Classification with Prior Knowledge", "Abstract": "A major challenge in scene graph classification is that the appearance of objects and relations can be significantly different from one image to another. Previous works have addressed this by relational reasoning over all objects in an image or incorporating prior knowledge into classification. Unlike previous works, we do not consider separate models for perception and prior knowledge. Instead, we take a multi-task learning approach by introducing schema representations and implementing the classification as an attention layer between image-based representations and the schemata. This allows for the prior knowledge to emerge and propagate within the perception model. By enforcing the model also to represent the prior, we achieve a strong inductive bias. We show that our model can accurately generate commonsense knowledge and that the iterative injection of this knowledge to scene representations, as a top-down mechanism, leads to significantly higher classification performance. Additionally, our model can be fine-tuned on external knowledge given as triples. When combined with self-supervised learning and with 1% of annotated images only, this gives more than 3% improvement in object classification, 26% in scene graph classification, and 36% in predicate prediction accuracy."}

Our work seeks to fill this gap by treating these two systems as black boxes to be integrated as modules into a single architecture, without making assumptions on their internal structure and semantics. Instead, we expect only that each module exposes certain methods for accessing the functions that the module implements: the symbolic module exposes a deduction method for computing the function's output on a given input, and an abduction method for computing the function's inputs for a given output; the neural module exposes a deduction method for computing the function's output on a given input, and an induction method for updating the function given input-output training instances. We are, then, able to show that a symbolic module --- with any choice for syntax and semantics, as long as the deduction and abduction methods are exposed --- can be cleanly integrated with a neural module, and facilitate the latter's efficient training, achieving empirical performance that exceeds that of previous work."}

To this end, we present a model where elections can be manipulated by convincing voters to demote specific non-favored candidates, and study its properties in the classic setting of scoring rules.  When the goal is constructive (making a preferred candidate win),  we prove that finding such a demotion strategy is easy for Plurality and Veto, while generally hard for t-approval and Borda. We also provide a t-factor approximation for t-approval for every fixed t, and a 3-factor approximation algorithm for Borda. Interestingly enough - following recent trends in political science that show that the effectiveness of negative campaigning depends on the type of candidate and demographic - when assigning varying prices to different possible demotion operations, we are able to provide inapproximability results.   When the goal is destructive (making the leading opponent lose), we show that the problem is easy for a broad class of scoring rules."}

Consider a graph G, which represents a social network. Assume that initially a subset of nodes, called seed nodes or early adopters, are colored either black or white, which correspond to positive or negative opinion regarding a consumer product or a technological innovation. Then, in each round an uncolored node, which is adjacent to at least one colored node, chooses the most frequent color among its neighbors.  Consider a marketing campaign which advertises a product of poor quality and its ultimate goal is that more than half of the population believe in the quality of the product at the end of the opinion diffusion process. We focus on three types of attackers which can select the seed nodes in a deterministic or random fashion and manipulate almost half of them to adopt a positive opinion toward the product (that is, to choose black color). We say that an attacker succeeds if a majority of nodes are black at the end of the process. Our main purpose is to characterize classes of graphs where an attacker cannot succeed. In particular, we prove that if the maximum degree of the underlying graph is not too large or if it has strong expansion properties, then it is fairly resilient to such attacks.  Furthermore, we prove tight bounds on the stabilization time of the process (that is, the number of rounds it needs to end) in both settings of choosing the seed nodes deterministically and randomly. We also provide several hardness results for some optimization problems regarding stabilization time and choice of seed nodes."}

Recently, it was demonstrated that a new estimation method called \"quantal regret\" produces more accurate estimates for human agents than the classic approach that assumes that agents are rational and reach a Nash equilibrium; however, this method has not been compared to methods that take into account behavioral aspects of human play. In this paper we leverage equilibrium concepts from behavioral economics for this purpose and ask how well they perform compared to the quantal regret and Nash equilibrium methods. We develop four estimation methods based on established behavioral equilibrium models to infer the utilities of human agents from observed data of normal-form games. The equilibrium models we study are quantal-response equilibrium, action-sampling equilibrium, payoff-sampling equilibrium, and impulse-balance equilibrium. We show that in some of these concepts the inference is achieved analytically via closed formulas, while in the others the inference is achieved only algorithmically. We use experimental data of 2x2 games to evaluate the estimation success of these behavioral equilibrium methods. The results show that the estimates they produce are more accurate than the estimates of the Nash equilibrium. The comparison with the quantal-regret method shows that the behavioral methods have better hit rates, but the quantal-regret method performs better in terms of the overall mean squared error, and we discuss the differences between the methods."}

In order to compute market equilibria, we introduce (infinite-dimensional) convex programs over Banach spaces, thereby generalizing the Eisenberg-Gale convex program and its dual. Regarding the new convex programs, we establish existence of optimal solutions, KKT conditions, as well as strong duality. All these properties are established via non-standard arguments, which circumvent the limitations of duality theory in optimization over infinite-dimensional vector spaces. Furthermore, we show that there exists a pure equilibrium allocation, i.e., a division of the item space. Similar to the finite-dimensional case, a market equilibrium under the infinite-dimensional Fisher market is Pareto optimal, envy-free and proportional. We also show how to obtain the (a.e. unique) equilibrium prices and a pure equilibrium allocation from the (unique) equilibrium utility prices. When the item space is the unit interval [0,1] and buyers have piecewise linear utilities, we show that approximate equilibrium prices can be computed in polynomial time. This is achieved by solving a finite-dimensional convex program using the ellipsoid method. To this end, we give nontrivial and efficient subgradient and separation oracles. For general buyer valuations, we propose computing market equilibrium using stochastic dual averaging, which finds approximate equilibrium prices with high probability."}

Besides encoding interaction sparsity, however, real networks often exhibit a multi-scale structure, in which agents can be grouped into communities, those communities further grouped, and so on, and where interactions among such groups may also exhibit sparsity. We present a general model of multi-scale network games that encodes such multi-level structure. We then develop several algorithmic approaches that leverage this multi-scale structure, and derive sufficient conditions for convergence of these to a Nash equilibrium. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches enable orders of magnitude improvements in scalability when computing Nash equilibria in such games. For example, we can solve previously intractable instances involving up to 1 million agents in under 15 minutes."}

Despite their ubiquitous applications, it is not clear whether it is possible to design information structures to ameliorate the overall experience of the network users. We focus on Bayesian games with atomic players, where network vagaries are modeled via a (random) state of nature which determines the costs incurred by the players. A third-party entity—the sender—can observe the realized state of the network and exploit this additional information to send a signal to each player. A natural question is the following: is it possible for an informed sender to reduce the overall social cost via the strategic provision of information to players who update their beliefs rationally? The paper focuses on the problem of computing optimal ex ante persuasive signaling schemes, showing that symmetry is a crucial property for its solution. Indeed, we show that an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time when players are symmetric and have affine cost functions. Moreover, the problem becomes NP-hard when players are asymmetric, even in non-Bayesian settings."}

The winner of each battlefield is determined by a winner-take-all rule, independently of other battlefields. In the original formulation, each colonel’s goal is to win as many battlefields as possible. The Blotto game and its extensions have been used in a wide range of applications from political campaign—exemplified by the U.S presidential election—to marketing campaign, from (innovative) technology competition to sports competition. Despite persistent efforts, efficient methods for finding the optimal strategies in Blotto games have been elusive for almost a century—due to exponential explosion in the organic solution space—until Ahmadinejad, Dehghani, Hajiaghayi, Lucier, Mahini, and Seddighin developed the first polynomial-time algorithm for this fundamental gametheoretical problem in 2016. However, that breakthrough polynomial-time solution has some structural limitation. It applies only to the case where troops are homogeneous with respect to battlegruounds, as in Borel’s original formulation: For each battleground, the only factor that matters to the winner’s payoff is how many troops as opposed to which sets of troops are opposing one another in that battleground.   In this paper, we consider a more general setting of the two-player-multi-battleground game, in which multifaceted resources (troops) may have different contributions to different battlegrounds. In the case of U.S presidential campaign, for example, one may interpret this as different types of resources—human, financial, political—that teams can invest in each state. We provide a complexity-theoretical evidence that, in contrast to Borel’s homogeneous setting, finding optimal strategies in multifaceted Colonel Blotto games is intractable. We complement this complexity result with a polynomial-time algorithm that finds approximately optimal strategies with provable guarantees. We also study a further generalization when two competitors do not have zerosum/ constant-sum payoffs. We show that optimal strategies in these two-player-multi-battleground games are as hard to compute and approximate as Nash equilibria in general noncooperative  games and economic equilibria in exchange markets."}

If agents are drawing their data from different distributions, though, federated learning might produce a biased global model that is not optimal for each agent. This means that agents face a fundamental question: should they join the global model or stay with their local model? In this work, we show how this situation can be naturally analyzed through the framework of coalitional game theory.   Motivated by these considerations, we propose the following game: there are heterogeneous players with different model parameters governing their data distribution and different amounts of data they have noisily drawn from their own distribution. Each player's goal is to obtain a model with minimal expected mean squared error (MSE) on their own distribution. They have a choice of fitting a model based solely on their own data, or combining their learned parameters with those of some subset of the other players. Combining models reduces the variance component of their error through access to more data, but increases the bias because of the heterogeneity of distributions. In this work, we derive exact expected MSE values for problems in linear regression and mean estimation. We use these values to analyze the resulting game in the framework of hedonic game theory; we study how players might divide into coalitions, where each set of players within a coalition jointly constructs a single model.  In a case with arbitrarily many players that each have either a \"small\" or \"large\" amount of data, we constructively show that there always exists a stable partition of players into coalitions."}

While it is sometimes impossible to allocate a proportional share to every agent under the separation requirement, we show that the well-known criterion of maximin share fairness can always be attained. We then establish several computational properties of maximin share fairness---for instance, the maximin share of an agent cannot be computed exactly by any finite algorithm, but can be approximated with an arbitrarily small error. In addition, we consider the division of a pie (i.e., a circular cake) and show that an ordinal relaxation of maximin share fairness can be achieved."}

We describe a deliberation process in which agents dynamically form coalitions  around proposals that they prefer over the status quo.  We formulate conditions on the space of proposals and on the ways in which coalitions are formed that guarantee deliberation to succeed, that is, to terminate by identifying a proposal with the largest possible support.

We introduce predictive Blackwell approachability, where an estimate of the next payoff vector is given, and the decision maker tries to achieve better performance based on the accuracy of that estimator. In order to derive algorithms that achieve predictive Blackwell approachability, we start by showing a powerful connection between four well-known algorithms. Follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) and online mirror descent (OMD) are the most prevalent regret minimizers in online convex optimization. In spite of this prevalence, the regret matching (RM) and regret matching+ (RM+) algorithms have been preferred in the practice of solving large-scale games (as the local regret minimizers within the counterfactual regret minimization framework). We show that RM and RM+ are the algorithms that result from running FTRL and OMD, respectively, to select the halfspace to force at all times in the underlying Blackwell approachability game. By applying the predictive variants of FTRL or OMD to this connection, we obtain predictive Blackwell approachability algorithms, as well as predictive variants of RM and RM+. In experiments across 18 common zero-sum extensive-form benchmark games, we show that predictive RM+ coupled with counterfactual regret minimization converges vastly faster than the fastest prior algorithms (CFR+, DCFR, LCFR) across all games but two of the poker games, sometimes by two or more orders of magnitude."}

However, virtually all previous work makes the unrealistic assumption that the exact underlying utilities of the population (representing private tastes of individuals) are known to the regulator that imposes the fairness constraint. In this paper we initiate the discussion of the emph{mismatch}, the unavoidable difference between the underlying utilities of the population and the utilities assumed by the regulator. We demonstrate that the mismatch can make the disadvantaged protected group worse off after imposing the fairness constraint and provide tools to design fairness constraints that help the disadvantaged group despite the mismatch."}

The goal is to match every agent to a single item so as to maximize the social welfare. Most of the related literature, however, assumes that the values of the agents are not a priori known, and only access to the ordinal preferences of the agents over the items is provided. Consequently, this incomplete information leads to loss of efficiency, which is measured by the notion of distortion. In this paper, we further assume that the agents can answer a small number of queries, allowing us partial access to their values. We study the interplay between elicited cardinal information (measured by the number of queries per agent) and distortion for one-sided matching, as well as a wide range of well-studied related problems. Qualitatively, our results show that with a limited number of queries, it is possible to obtain significant improvements over the classic setting, where only access to ordinal information is given."}

The short answer could be – ``it depends...''. For some challenging cases, e.g., dialogue's topical spectrum spreads beyond the training corpus coverage, the chatbot may malfunction and return unsatisfied utterances. This problem can be addressed by introducing the Machine-Human Chatting Handoff (MHCH) which enables human-algorithm collaboration. To detect the normal/transferable utterances, we propose a Difficulty-Assisted Matching Inference (DAMI) network, utilizing difficulty-assisted encoding to enhance the representations of utterances. Moreover, a matching inference mechanism is introduced to capture the contextual matching features. A new evaluation metric, Golden Transfer within Tolerance (GT-T), is proposed to assess the performance by considering the tolerance property of the MHCH. To provide insights into the task and validate the proposed model, we collect two new datasets. Extensive experimental results are presented and contrasted against a series of baseline models to demonstrate the efficacy of our model on MHCH."}

Such assumptions, however, substantially mismatch with observed human behaviors such as satisficing with sub-optimal, risk-seeking, and loss-aversion decisions. Drawing on iterative reasoning models and cumulative prospect theory, we propose a new game-theoretic framework, bounded risk-sensitive Markov Game (BRSMG), that captures two aspects of realistic human behaviors: bounded intelligence and risk-sensitivity. General solutions to both the forward policy design problem and the inverse reward learning problem are provided with theoretical analysis and simulation verification. We validate the proposed forward policy design algorithm and the inverse reward learning algorithm in a two-player navigation scenario. The results show that agents demonstrate bounded-intelligence, risk-averse and risk-seeking behaviors in our framework. Moreover, in the inverse reward learning task, the proposed bounded risk-sensitive inverse learning algorithm outperforms a baseline risk-neutral inverse learning algorithm by effectively learning not only more accurate reward values but also the intelligence levels and the risk-measure parameters of agents from demonstrations."}

However, these approaches generate story plans or plots sequentially, leaving the non-sequential conception and structural design processes of human writers unexplored. To mimic human writers and exploit the fine-grained, intrinsic structural information of each story, we decompose automatic story generation into sub-problems of graph construction, graph generation, and graph-infused sequence generation. Specifically, we propose a graph-infused dual conditional variational autoencoder model to capture multi-level intra-story structures (i.e., graph) by continuous variational latent variables and generate consistent stories through dual-infusion of story structure planning and content learning. Experimental results on the ROCStories dataset and the CMU Movie Summary corpus confirm that our proposed model outperforms strong baselines in both human judges and widely-used automatic metrics."}

The tremendous amounts of VDA users bring in diverse emotion expressions. How to achieve a high emotion inferring performance from large-scale Internet Voice Data in VDAs? Traditionally, researches on speech emotion recognition are based on acted voice datasets, which have limited speakers but strong and clear emotion expressions. Inspired by this, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to leverage acted voice data with strong emotion expressions to enhance large-scale unlabeled internet voice data with diverse emotion expressions for emotion inferring. Specifically, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal curriculum augmentation deep learning framework. First, to learn more general emotion cues, we adopt a curriculum learning based epoch-wise training strategy, which trains our model guided by strong and balanced emotion samples from acted voice data and sub-sequently leverages weak and unbalanced emotion samples from internet voice data.Second, to employ more diverse emotion expressions, we design a Multi-path Mix-match Multimodal Deep Neural Network(MMMD), which effectively learns feature representations for multiple modalities and trains labeled and unlabeled data in hybrid semi-supervised methods for superior generalization and robustness. Experiments on an internet voice dataset with 500,000 utterances show our method outperforms (+10.09% in terms of F1) several alternative baselines,  while an acted corpus with 2,397 utterances contributes 4.35%. To further compare our method with state-of-the-art techniques in traditionally acted voice datasets, we also conduct experiments on public dataset IEMOCAP.

Existing methods often rely on \"attention\" mechanisms for explaining classification results by estimating the relative importance of input units. However, recent studies have shown that such mechanisms tend to mis-identify irrelevant input units in their explanation. In this work, we propose a hybrid human-AI approach that incorporates human rationales into attention-based text classification models to improve the explainability of classification results. Specifically, we ask workers to provide rationales for their annotation by selecting relevant pieces of text. We introduce MARTA, a Bayesian framework that jointly learns an attention-based model and the reliability of workers while injecting human rationales into model training. We derive a principled optimization algorithm based on variational inference with efficient updating rules for learning MARTA parameters. Extensive validation on real-world datasets shows that our framework significantly improves the state of the art both in terms of classification explainability and accuracy."}

However, results have mostly been demonstrated on imitating a single distinct motion pattern, and do not generalize to interactive tasks that require flexible motion patterns due to varying human-object spatial configurations. To bridge this gap, we focus on one class of interactive tasks---sitting onto a chair. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework which relies on a collection of subtask controllers trained to imitate simple, reusable mocap motions, and a meta controller trained to execute the subtasks properly to complete the main task. We experimentally demonstrate the strength of our approach over different non-hierarchical and hierarchical baselines. We also show that our approach can be applied to motion prediction given an image input. A supplementary video can be found at https://youtu.be/3CeN0OGz2cA."}

To improve the accessibility of these devices and to enable their usage in a variety of settings, building models that can assist users and accomplish tasks through the UI is vitally important. However, there are several challenges to achieve this. First, UI components of similar appearance can have different functionalities, making understanding their function more important than just analyzing their appearance. Second, domain-specific features like Document Object Model (DOM) in web pages and View Hierarchy (VH) in mobile applications provide important signals about the semantics of UI elements, but these features are not in a natural language format. Third, owing to a large diversity in UIs and absence of standard DOM or VH representations, building a UI understanding model with high coverage requires large amounts of training data.   Inspired by the success of pre-training based approaches in NLP for tackling a variety of problems in a data-efficient way, we introduce a new pre-trained UI representation model called ActionBert. Our methodology is designed to leverage visual, linguistic and domain-specific features in user interaction traces to pre-train generic feature representations of UIs and their components. Our key intuition is that user actions, e.g., a sequence of clicks on different UI components, reveals important information about their functionality. We evaluate the proposed model on a wide variety of downstream tasks, ranging from icon classification to UI component retrieval based on its natural language description. Experiments show that the proposed ActionBert model outperforms multi-modal baselines across all downstream tasks by up to 15.5%."}

Recent data-driven inertial odometry approaches have demonstrated the increasing feasibility of inertial navigation. However, they still rely upon conventional smartphone orientation estimates that they assume to be accurate, while in fact these orientation estimates can be a significant source of error. To address the problem of inaccurate orientation estimates, we present a two-stage, data-driven pipeline using a commodity smartphone that first estimates device orientations and then estimates device position. The orientation module relies on a recurrent neural network and Extended Kalman Filter to obtain orientation estimates that are used to then rotate raw IMU measurements into the appropriate reference frame. The position module then passes those measurements through another recurrent network architecture to perform localization. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both orientation and position error on a large dataset we constructed that contains 20 hours of pedestrian motion across 3 buildings and 15 subjects.

However, it is difficult to model the true dynamics of the real world before execution, especially for tasks requiring interactions with objects whose parameters are unknown. A recent planning approach, CMAX, tackles this problem by adapting the planner online during execution to bias the resulting plans away from inaccurately modeled regions. CMAX, while being provably guaranteed to reach the goal, requires strong assumptions on the accuracy of the model used for planning and fails to improve the quality of the solution over repetitions of the same task. In this paper we propose CMAX++, an approach that leverages real-world experience to improve the quality of resulting plans over successive repetitions of a robotic task. CMAX++ achieves this by integrating model-free learning using acquired experience with model-based planning using the potentially inaccurate model. We provide provable guarantees on the completeness and asymptotic convergence of CMAX++ to the optimal path cost as the number of repetitions increases. CMAX++ is also shown to outperform baselines in simulated robotic tasks including 3D mobile robot navigation where the track friction is incorrectly modeled, and a 7D pick-and-place task where the mass of the object is unknown leading to discrepancy between true and modeled dynamics."}

However, how best to fuse multiple modalities (e.g., image and depth) and to deal with degraded or missing input are less well studied. In particular, we note that previous approaches towards deep fusion do not perform significantly better than models employing a single modality. We conjecture that this is because of the naive approaches to feature space fusion through summation or concatenation which do not take into account the different strengths of each modality. To address this, we propose an end-to-end framework, termed VMLoc, to fuse different sensor inputs into a common latent space through a variational Product-of-Experts (PoE) followed by attention-based fusion. Unlike previous multimodal variational works directly adapting the objective function of vanilla variational auto-encoder, we show how camera localization can be accurately estimated through an unbiased objective function based on importance weighting. Our model is extensively evaluated on RGB-D datasets and the results prove the efficacy of our model. The source code is available at https://github.com/Zalex97/VMLoc."}

Automated synthesis of BTs can reduce human workload and build behavior models for complex tasks beyond the ability of human design, but theoretical studies are almost missing in existing methods because it is difficult to conduct formal analysis with the classic BT representations. As a result, they may fail in tasks that are actually solvable. This paper proposes BT expansion, an automated planning approach to building intelligent robot behaviors with BTs, and proves the soundness and completeness through the state-space formulation of BTs. The advantages of blended reactive planning and acting are formally discussed through the region of attraction of BTs, by which robots with BT expansion are robust to any resolvable external disturbances. Experiments with a mobile manipulator and test sets are simulated to validate the effectiveness and efficiency, where the proposed algorithm surpasses the baseline by virtue of its soundness and completeness. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to leverage the state-space formulation to synthesize BTs with a complete theoretical basis."}

However, most existing methods need to access the training data of past 3D object classes when facing the common real-world scenario: new classes of 3D objects arrive in a sequence. Moreover, the performance of advanced approaches degrades dramatically for past learned classes (i.e., catastrophic forgetting), due to the irregular and redundant geometric structures of 3D point cloud data. To address these challenges, we propose a new Incremental 3D Object Learning (i.e., I3DOL) model, which is the first exploration to learn new classes of 3D object continually. Specifically, an adaptive-geometric centroid module is designed to construct discriminative local geometric structures, which can better characterize the irregular point cloud representation for 3D object. Afterwards, to prevent the catastrophic forgetting brought by redundant geometric information, a geometric-aware attention mechanism is developed to quantify the contributions of local geometric structures, and explore unique 3D geometric characteristics with high contributions for classes incremental learning. Meanwhile, a score fairness compensation strategy is proposed to further alleviate the catastrophic forgetting caused by unbalanced data between past and new classes of 3D object, by compensating biased prediction for new classes in the validation phase. Experiments on 3D representative datasets validate the superiority of our I3DOL framework."}

SCAN encodes the influence of spatially close neighbors using a novel spatial attention mechanism in a manner that relies on fewer assumptions, is parameter efficient, and is more interpretable compared to state-of-the-art spatial attention approaches.

The exponential time hypothesis (ETH) implies that the best algorithms to solve these problems take exponential time in the worst case. However, accounting for the treewidth, the consistency problem for ASP is slightly harder than SAT: while SAT can be solved by an algorithm that runs in exponential time in the treewidth k, ASP requires exponential time in k · log(k). This extra cost is due to checking that there are no self-supported true atoms due to positive cycles in the program. In this paper, we refine this recent result and show that consistency for ASP can be decided in exponential time in k · log(ι) where ι is a novel measure, bounded by both treewidth k and the size of the largest strongly-connected component of the positive dependency graph of the program. We provide a treewidth-aware reduction from ASP to SAT that adheres to the above limit."}

But real world knowledge-bases are often obtained by combining data from various sources.  This, inherently, might result in certain inconsistencies (with respect to a given query) and requires to estimate a degree of inconsistency before using a knowledge-base. In this paper, we provide a complexity analysis of fixed-domain non-entailment (NE) on Datalog programs for well-established families of knowledge bases (KBs). We exhibit a detailed complexity map for the decision cases, counting and projected counting, which may serve as a quantitative measure for inconsistency of a KB with respect to a query. Our results show that NE is natural for the second, third, and fourth level of the polynomial (counting) hierarchy depending on the type of the studied query (stratified, normal, disjunctive) and one level higher for the projected versions. Further, we show fixed-parameter tractability by bounding the treewidth, provide a constructive algorithm, and show its theoretical limitation in terms of conditional lower bounds."}

While recent works retrieve supporting facts/evidence from commonsense knowledge bases to supply additional information to each question, there is still ample opportunity to advance it on the quality of the evidence. It is crucial since the quality of the evidence is the key to answering common- sense questions, and even determines the upper bound on the QA systems’ performance. In this paper, we propose a recursive erasure memory network (REM-Net) to cope with the quality improvement of evidence. To address this, REM-Net is equipped with a module to refine the evidence by recursively erasing the low-quality evidence that does not explain the question answering. Besides, instead of retrieving evidence from existing knowledge bases, REM-Net leverages a pre-trained generative model to generate candidate evidence customized for the question. We conduct experiments on two commonsense question answering datasets, WIQA and CosmosQA. The results demonstrate the performance of REM- Net and show that the refined evidence is explainable."}

In this work, we posit that manually constructed CSKGs will never achieve the coverage necessary to be applicable in all situations encountered by NLP agents. Therefore, we propose a new evaluation framework for testing the utility of KGs based on how effectively implicit knowledge representations can be learned from them.   With this new goal, we propose Atomic 2020, a new CSKG of general-purpose commonsense knowledge containing knowledge that is not readily available in pretrained language models. We evaluate its properties in comparison with other leading CSKGs, performing the first large-scale pairwise study of commonsense knowledge resources. Next, we show that Atomic 2020 is better suited for training knowledge models that can generate accurate, representative knowledge for new, unseen entities and events.

Moreover, KG-BART can leverage the graph attention to aggregate the rich concept semantics that enhances the model generalization on unseen concept sets. Experiments on benchmark CommonGen dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach by comparing with several strong pre-trained language generation models, particularly KG-BART outperforms BART by 5.80, 4.60, in terms of BLEU-3, 4.

Within central formal approaches to structured argumentation, preferential approaches are applied by lifting preferences over defeasible elements to rankings over sets of defeasible elements, in order to be able to compare the relative strength of two arguments and their respective defeasible constituents. To overcome the current gap in the scientific landscape, we give in this paper a general study of the critical component of lifting operators in structured argumentation. We survey existing lifting operators scattered in the literature of argumentation theory, social choice, and utility theory, and show fundamental relations and properties of these operators. Extending existing works from argumentation and social choice, we propose a list of postulates for lifting operations, and give a complete picture of (non-)satisfaction for the considered operators. Based on our postulates, we present impossibility results, stating for which sets of postulates there is no hope of satisfaction, and for two main lifting operators presented in structured argumentation, Elitist and Democratic, we give a full characterization in terms of our postulates."}

We propose Chronological Rotation embedding (ChronoR), a novel model for learning representations for entities, relations, and time. Learning dense representations is frequently used as an efficient and versatile method to perform reasoning on knowledge graphs. The proposed model learns a k-dimensional rotation transformation parametrized by relation and time, such that after each fact's head entity is transformed using the rotation, it falls near its corresponding tail entity. By using high dimensional rotation as its transformation operator, ChronoR captures rich interaction between the temporal and multi-relational characteristics of a Temporal Knowledge Graph.

In this paper, after providing an intuitive semantics  based on Lukasiewicz's logic for AFs with (strong) constraints, called Constrained AFs (CAFs), we propose Weak constrained AFs (WAFs)  that enhance CAFs with weak constraints.  Intuitively, these constraints can be used to find ``optimal''  solutions to problems defined through CAFs. We provide a detailed complexity analysis of CAFs and WAFs, showing that strong constraints do not increase the expressive  power of AFs in most cases,  while weak constraints systematically increase the expressive  power of CAFs under several well-known argumentation semantics."}

The projective Beth definability property (PBDP) states that an explicit definition exists iff a formula stating implicit definability is valid. Thus, the CIP and PBDP transform potentially hard existence problems into deduction problems in the underlying logic. Description Logics with nominals and/or role inclusions do not enjoy the CIP nor PBDP, but interpolants and explicit definitions have many potential applications in ontology engineering and ontology-based data management. In this article we show the following: even without Craig and Beth, the existence of interpolants and explicit definitions is decidable in description logics with nominals and/or role inclusions such as ALCO, ALCH and ALCHIO. However, living without Craig and Beth makes this problem harder than deduction: we prove that the existence problems become 2EXPTIME-complete, thus one exponential harder than validity. The existence of explicit definitions is 2EXPTIME-hard even if one asks for a definition of a nominal using any symbol distinct from that nominal, but it becomes EXPTIME-complete if one asks for a definition of a concept name using any symbol distinct from that concept name."}

Informally, a module represents a piece of knowledge. It can be given by a knowledge base, be an agent, an ASP, ILP, CP program, etc. Formally, a module is a class of structures over the same vocabulary. Modules are combined declaratively, using, essentially, operations of Codd's relational algebra.  In this paper, we address the problem of checking modular system containment, which we relate to a homomorphism problem. We prove that, for a large class of modular systems, the containment problem (and thus equivalence) is in the complexity class NP, and therefore is solvable by, e.g.,  SAT solvers. We discuss  conditions under which  the problem is polynomial time solvable."}

We perform both theoretical analysis on the convergence of the proposed technique and experimental comparison with state-of-the-arts. Results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that our method can consistently match or outperform prior approaches for provable l∞ robustness.

Similar to other factor analysis methods, DSARF approximates high dimensional data by a product between time dependent weights and spatially dependent factors. These weights and factors are in turn represented in terms of lower dimensional latent variables that are inferred using stochastic variational inference. DSARF is different from the state-of-the-art techniques in that it parameterizes the weights in terms of a deep switching vector auto-regressive likelihood governed with a Markovian prior, which is able to capture the non-linear inter-dependencies among weights to characterize multimodal temporal dynamics. This results in a flexible hierarchical deep generative factor analysis model that can be extended to (i) provide a collection of potentially interpretable states abstracted from the process dynamics, and (ii) perform short- and long-term vector time series prediction in a complex multi-relational setting. Our extensive experiments, which include simulated data and real data from a wide range of applications such as climate change, weather forecasting, traffic, infectious disease spread and nonlinear physical systems attest the superior performance of DSARF in terms of long- and short-term prediction error, when compared with the state-of-the-art methods."}

However, unlike the conventional CNNs that have been extensively explored and exhaustively tested, people are still worrying about the GNNs' robustness under the critical settings, such as financial services. The main reason is that existing GNNs usually serve as a black-box in predicting and do not provide the uncertainty on the predictions. On the other side, the recent advancement of Bayesian deep learning on CNNs has demonstrated its success of quantifying and explaining such uncertainties to fortify CNN models. Motivated by these observations, we propose UAG, the first systematic solution to defend adversarial attacks on GNNs through identifying and exploiting hierarchical uncertainties in GNNs. UAG develops a Bayesian uncertainty technique to explicitly capture uncertainties in GNNs and further employs an uncertainty-aware attention technique to defend adversarial attacks on GNNs. Intensive experiments show that our proposed defense approach outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by a significant margin."}

(2) A bottleneck value exists, and continuing to optimize ELBO after this value will not improve inference accuracy. On the basis of the experiment results, we propose SHOT-VAE to address these problems without introducing additional prior knowledge. The SHOT-VAE offers two contributions: (1) A new ELBO approximation named smooth-ELBO that integrates the label predictive loss into ELBO. (2) An approximation based on optimal interpolation that breaks the ELBO value bottleneck by reducing the margin between ELBO and the data likelihood. The SHOT-VAE achieves good performance with 25.30% error rate on CIFAR-100 with 10k labels and reduces the error rate to 6.11% on CIFAR-10 with 4k labels."}

By conditioning on an effective context, Meta-RL policies can easily generalize to new tasks within a few adaptation steps. We argue that improving the quality of context involves answering two questions: 1. How to train a compact and sufficient encoder that can embed the task-specific information contained in prior trajectories? 2. How to collect informative trajectories of which the corresponding context reflects the specification of tasks? To this end, we propose a novel Meta-RL framework called CCM (Contrastive learning augmented Context-based Meta-RL). We first focus on the contrastive nature behind different tasks and leverage it to train a compact and sufficient context encoder. Further, we train a separate exploration policy and theoretically derive a new information-gain-based objective which aims to collect informative trajectories in a few steps. Empirically, we evaluate our approaches on common benchmarks as well as several complex sparse-reward environments. The experimental results show that CCM outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by addressing previously mentioned problems respectively."}

In this paper, we propose an agreement-discrepancy-selection (ADS) approach, and target at unifying distribution alignment with sample selection by introducing adversarial classifiers to the convolutional neural network (CNN). Minimizing classifiers' prediction discrepancy (maximizing prediction agreement) drives learning CNN features to reduce the distribution bias of labeled and unlabeled samples, while maximizing classifiers' discrepancy highlights informative samples. Iterative optimization of agreement and discrepancy loss calibrated with an entropy function drives aligning sample distributions in a progressive fashion for effective active learning. Experiments on image classification and object detection tasks demonstrate that ADS is task-agnostic, while significantly outperforms the previous methods when the labeled sets are small."}

Label regularization techniques are also proposed with the motivation of softening the labels while neglecting the relation of classes. Among them, the technique of knowledge distillation proposes to distill the soft label, which contains the knowledge of class relations. However, this technique needs to pre-train an extra cumbersome teacher model. In this paper, we propose a method called Knowledge Refinery (KR), which enables the neural network to learn the relation of classes on-the-fly without the teacher-student training strategy. We propose the definition of decoupled labels, which consist of the original hard label and the residual label. To exhibit the generalization of KR, we evaluate our method in both fields of computer vision and natural language processing. Our empirical results show consistent performance gains under all experimental settings."}

In this paper, we address the problem of Semi-Supervised DML (SSDML) that tries to learn a metric using a few labeled examples, and abundantly available unlabeled examples. SSDML is important because it is infeasible to manually annotate all the examples present in a large dataset. Surprisingly, with the exception of a few classical approaches that learn a linear Mahalanobis metric, SSDML has not been studied in the recent years, and lacks approaches in the deep SSDML scenario. In this paper, we address this challenging problem, and revamp SSDML with respect to deep learning. In particular, we propose a stochastic, graph-based approach that first propagates the affinities between the pairs of examples from labeled data, to that of the unlabeled pairs. The propagated affinities are used to mine triplet based constraints for metric learning. We impose orthogonality constraint on the metric parameters, as it leads to a better performance by avoiding a model collapse."}

While the accuracy of deep neural networks is increasing, the confidence score, which indicates the reliability of the prediction results, is becoming more important. Deep neural networks are seen as highly accurate but known to be overconfident, making it important to calibrate the confidence score. Many studies have been conducted on confidence calibration. They calibrate the confidence score of the model to match its accuracy, but it is not clear whether these confidence scores can improve the performance of systems that use confidence scores. This paper focuses on cascade inference systems, one kind of systems using confidence scores, and discusses the desired confidence score to improve system performance in terms of inference accuracy and computational cost. Based on the discussion, we propose a new confidence calibration method, Learning to Cascade. Learning to Cascade is a simple but novel method that optimizes the loss term for confidence calibration simultaneously with the original loss term. Experiments are conducted using two datasets, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, in two system settings, and show that naive application of existing calibration methods to cascade inference systems sometimes performs worse. However, Learning to Cascade always achieves a better trade-off between inference accuracy and computational cost. The simplicity of Learning to Cascade allows it to be easily applied to improve the performance of existing systems."}

In this paper, we propose Hypergradient Data Relevance Analysis, or HyDRA, which interprets the predictions made by DNNs as effects of their training data. Existing approaches generally estimate data contributions around the final model parameters and ignore how the training data shape the optimization trajectory. By unrolling the hypergradient of test loss w.r.t. the weights of training data, HyDRA assesses the contribution of training data toward test data points throughout the training trajectory. In order to accelerate computation, we remove the Hessian from the calculation and prove that, under moderate conditions, the approximation error is bounded. Corroborating this theoretical claim, empirical results indicate the error is indeed small. In addition, we quantitatively demonstrate that HyDRA outperforms influence functions in accurately estimating data contribution and detecting noisy data labels.

Estimator-based NAS has been proposed recently to model the relationship between architectures and their performance to enable scalable and flexible search. However, existing estimator-based methods encode the architecture into a latent space without considering graph similarity. Ignoring graph similarity in node-based search space may induce a large inconsistency between similar graphs and their distance in the continuous encoding space, leading to inaccurate encoding representation and/or reduced representation capacity that can yield sub-optimal search results. To preserve graph correlation information in encoding, we propose NASGEM which stands for Neural Architecture Search via Graph Embedding Method. NASGEM is driven by a novel graph embedding method equipped with similarity measures to capture the graph topology information. By precisely estimating the graph distance and using an auxiliary Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel to guide the encoding, NASGEM can utilize additional structural information to get more accurate graph representation to improve the search efficiency. GEMNet, a set of networks discovered by NASGEM, consistently outperforms networks crafted by existing search methods in classification tasks, i.e., with 0.4%-3.6% higher accuracy while having 11%- 21% fewer Multiply-Accumulates. We further transfer GEMNet for COCO object detection. In both one-stage and twostage detectors, our GEMNet surpasses its manually-crafted and automatically-searched counterparts."}

Evaluating their functional properties, e.g., drug effectiveness and prediction accuracy, is usually costly in terms of time, money, energy, or environment, becoming a bottleneck for the graph generation task. In this work, from the perspective of saving cost, we propose a novel Cost-Aware Graph Generation (CAGG) framework to generate graphs with optimal properties at as low cost as possible. By introducing a robust Bayesian graph neural network as the surrogate model and a goal-oriented training scheme for the generation model, the CAGG can approach the real expensive evaluation function and generate search space close to the optimal property, to avoid unnecessary evaluations. Intensive experiments conducted on two challenging real-world applications, including molecular discovery and neural architecture search, demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability. The results show that it can generate the optimal graphs and reduce the evaluation costs significantly compared to the state-of-the-art."}

Each time the policy improves, the nature of the problem changes, shifting both the distribution of states and their values. In this paper we take a novel perspective, arguing that the value prediction problems faced by an RL agent should not be addressed in isolation, but rather as a single, holistic, prediction problem. An RL algorithm generates a sequence of policies that, at least approximately, improve towards the optimal policy. We explicitly characterize the associated sequence of value functions and call it the value-improvement path. Our main idea is to approximate the value-improvement path holistically, rather than to solely track the value function of the current policy. Specifically, we discuss the impact that this holistic view of RL has on representation learning. We demonstrate that a representation that spans the past value-improvement path will also provide an accurate value approximation for future policy improvements. We use this insight to better understand existing approaches to auxiliary tasks and to propose new ones. To test our hypothesis empirically, we augmented a standard deep RL agent with an auxiliary task of learning the value-improvement path. In a study of Atari 2600 games, the augmented agent achieved approximately double the mean and median performance of the baseline agent."}

Related optimization, including influence maximization, model parameter inference, or the development of vaccination strategies, relies heavily on sampling from a model. This is either inefficient or inaccurate. As alternative, we present an efficient message passing algorithm that computes the probability distribution of the cascade size for the Independent Cascade Model on weighted directed networks and generalizations.

This has become a topic of recent interest as a way to query a trained model and suggest possible actions to overturn its decision. Mathematically, the problem is formally equivalent to that of finding adversarial examples, which also has attracted significant attention recently. Most work on either counterfactual explanations or adversarial examples has focused on differentiable classifiers, such as neural nets. We focus on classification trees, both axis-aligned and oblique (having hyperplane splits). Although here the counterfactual optimization problem is nonconvex and nondifferentiable, we show that an exact solution can be computed very efficiently, even with high-dimensional feature vectors and with both continuous and categorical features, and demonstrate it in different datasets and settings. The results are particularly relevant for finance, medicine or legal applications, where interpretability and counterfactual explanations are particularly important."}

Pseudo-labeling works by applying pseudo-labels to samples in the unlabeled set by using a model trained on combination of the labeled samples and any previously pseudo-labeled samples, and iteratively repeating this process in a self-training cycle. Current methods seem to have abandoned this approach in favor of consistency regularization methods that train models under a combination of different styles of self-supervised losses on the unlabeled samples and standard supervised losses on the labeled samples. We empirically demonstrate that pseudo-labeling can in fact be competitive with the state-of-the-art, while being more resilient to out-of-distribution samples in the unlabeled set. We identify two key factors that allow pseudo-labeling to achieve such remarkable results (1) applying curriculum learning principles and (2) avoiding concept drift by restarting model parameters before each self-training cycle. We obtain 94.91% accuracy on CIFAR-10 using only 4,000 labeled samples, and 68.87% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet-ILSVRC using only 10% of the labeled samples."}

Recent evidence suggests that developing compressible representations allows the complexity of large networks to be adjusted for the learning task at hand. However, these representations are poorly understood. A promising strand of research inspired from biology involves studying representations at the unit level as it offers a more granular interpretation of the neural mechanisms. In order to better understand what facilitates increases in width without decreases in accuracy, we ask: Are there mechanisms at the unit level by which networks control their effective complexity? If so, how do these depend on the architecture, dataset, and hyperparameters? We identify two distinct types of “frivolous” units that proliferate when the network’s width increases: prunable units which can be dropped out of the network without significant change to the output and redundant units whose activities can be expressed as a linear combination of others. These units imply complexity constraints as the function the network computes could be expressed without them. We also identify how the development of these units can be influenced by architecture and a number of training factors. Together, these results help to explain why the accuracy of DNNs does not degrade when width is increased and highlight the importance of frivolous units toward understanding implicit regularization in DNNs."}

For strongly convex and smooth functions, Zhang et al. (2017) establish the squared path-length of the minimizer sequence (C*_{2,T}) as a lower bound on regret. They also show that online gradient descent (OGD) achieves this lower bound using multiple gradient queries per round. In this paper, we focus on unconstrained online optimization. We first show that a preconditioned variant of OGD achieves O(min{C*_T,C*_{2,T}}) with one gradient query per round (C*_T refers to the normal path-length). We then propose online optimistic Newton (OON) method for the case when the first and second order information of the function sequence is predictable. The regret bound of OON is captured via the quartic path-length of the minimizer sequence (C*_{4,T}), which can be much smaller than C*_{2,T}. We finally show that by using multiple gradients for OGD, we can achieve an upper bound of O(min{C*_{2,T},V_T}) on regret."}

Recent empirical evidence indicates that the practice of overparameterization not only benefits training large models, but also assists – perhaps counterintuitively – building lightweight models. Specifically, it suggests that overparameterization benefits model pruning / sparsification. This paper sheds light on these empirical findings by theoretically characterizing the high-dimensional asymptotics of model pruning in the overparameterized regime. The theory presented addresses the following core question: ``should one train a small model from the beginning, or first train a large model and then prune?''. We analytically identify regimes in which, even if the location of the most informative features is known, we are better off fitting a large model and then pruning rather than simply training with the known informative features. This leads to a new double descent in the training of sparse models: growing the original model, while preserving the target sparsity, improves the test accuracy as one moves beyond the overparameterization threshold. Our analysis further reveals the benefit of retraining by relating it to feature correlations. We find that the above phenomena are already present in linear and random-features models. Our technical approach advances the toolset of high-dimensional analysis and precisely characterizes the asymptotic distribution of over-parameterized least-squares. The intuition gained by analytically studying simpler models is numerically verified on neural networks."}

Our proposed model is based on conditional variational auto-encoders with disentanglement constraints to separate the label information from the latent representation. We give both intuitive and theoretical justifications for the model. Our verifier network is trained independently with the prediction model, which eliminates the need of retraining the verifier network for a new model.

Designing a general OoD generalization framework for a wide range of applications is challenging, mainly due to different kinds of distribution shifts in the real world, such as the shift across domains or the extrapolation of correlation. Most of the previous approaches can only solve one specific distribution shift, leading to unsatisfactory performance when applied to various OoD benchmarks. In this work, we propose DecAug, a novel decomposed feature representation and semantic augmentation approach for OoD generalization. Specifically, DecAug disentangles the category-related and context-related features by orthogonalizing the two gradients (w.r.t. intermediate features) of losses for predicting category and context labels, where category-related features contain causal information of the target object, while context-related features cause distribution shifts between training and test data. Furthermore, we perform gradient-based augmentation on context-related features to improve the robustness of learned representations. Experimental results show that DecAug outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on various OoD datasets, which is among the very few methods that can deal with different types of OoD generalization challenges."}

To manage this risk, a vital step is to be able to understand or generate a wide range of extreme scenarios. Existing approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at generating realistic samples, but seek to generate typical samples, rather than extreme samples. Hence, in this work, we propose ExGAN, a GAN-based approach to generate realistic and extreme samples. To model the extremes of the training distribution in a principled way, our work draws from Extreme Value Theory (EVT), a probabilistic approach for modelling the extreme tails of distributions. For practical utility, our framework allows the user to specify both the desired extremeness measure, as well as the desired extremeness probability they wish to sample at. Experiments on real US Precipitation data show that our method generates realistic samples, based on visual inspection and quantitative measures, in an efficient manner. Moreover, generating increasingly extreme examples using ExGAN can be done in constant time (with respect to the extremeness probability τ), as opposed to the O(1/τ) time required by the baseline approach."}

Recent studies employ the knowledge distillation (KD) method to improve the performance of quantized networks. In this study, we propose stochastic precision ensemble training for QDNNs (SPEQ). SPEQ is a knowledge distillation training scheme; however, the teacher is formed by sharing the model parameters of the student network. We obtain the soft labels of the teacher by randomly changing the bit precision of the activation stochastically at each layer of the forward-pass computation. The student model is trained with these soft labels to reduce the activation quantization noise. The cosine similarity loss is employed, instead of the KL-divergence, for KD training. As the teacher model changes continuously by random bit-precision assignment, it exploits the effect of stochastic ensemble KD. SPEQ outperforms the existing quantization training methods in various tasks, such as image classification, question-answering, and transfer learning without the need for cumbersome teacher networks."}

Furthermore, for certain objectives we devise improved results in the case of Must-link constraints, which are also the best possible from a theoretical perspective. Finally, we present experimental evidence that validates the effectiveness of our algorithms."}

However, it suffers from several drawbacks: 1) In reality, the underlying distributions are complicated and unknown, making it infeasible to be approximated by a simple distribution. 2) The correlation across dimensions of the input tensor is not well utilized, leading to sub-optimal performance. Although heuristics were proposed to incorporate such correlation as side information under Gaussian distribution, they can not easily be generalized to other distributions. Thus, a more principled way of utilizing the correlation in tensor factorization models is still an open challenge. Without assuming any explicit distribution, we formulate the tensor factorization as an optimal transport problem with Wasserstein distance, which can handle non-negative inputs.    We introduce SWIFT, which minimizes the Wasserstein distance that measures the distance between the input tensor and that of the reconstruction. In particular, we define the N-th order tensor Wasserstein loss for the widely used tensor CP factorization and derive the optimization algorithm that minimizes it. By leveraging sparsity structure and different equivalent formulations for optimizing computational efficiency, SWIFT is as scalable as other well-known CP algorithms. Using the factor matrices as features, SWIFT achieves up to 9.65% and 11.31% relative improvement over baselines for downstream prediction tasks. Under the noisy conditions, SWIFT achieves up to 15% and 17% relative improvements over the best competitors for the prediction tasks."}

The joint reward can be a non-linear function of the rewards of the selected individual arms. The direct use of a multi-armed bandit algorithm requires choosing among all possible combinations, making the action space large. To simplify the problem, existing works on combinatorial bandits typically assume feedback as a linear function of individual rewards. In this paper, we prove the lower bound for top-K subset selection with bandit feedback with possibly correlated rewards. We present a novel algorithm for the combinatorial setting without using individual arm feedback or requiring linearity of the reward function. Additionally, our algorithm works on correlated rewards of individual arms. Our algorithm, aDaptive Accept RejecT (DART), sequentially finds good arms and eliminates bad arms based on confidence bounds. DART is computationally efficient and uses storage linear in N. Further, DART  achieves a regret bound of Õ(K√KNT) for a time horizon T, which matches the lower bound in bandit feedback up to a factor of √log 2NT. When applied to the problem of cross-selling optimization and maximizing the mean of individual rewards, the performance of the proposed algorithm surpasses that of state-of-the-art algorithms. We also show that DART significantly outperforms existing methods for both linear and non-linear joint reward environments."}

MF is commonly used to obtain item embeddings and feature representations due to its ability to capture correlations and higher-order statistical dependencies across dimensions. In many applications, the categories of items exhibit a hierarchical tree structure. For instance, human diseases can be divided into coarse categories, e.g., bacterial, and viral. These categories can be further divided into finer categories, e.g., viral infections can be respiratory, gastrointestinal, and exanthematous viral diseases. In e-commerce, products, movies, books, etc., are grouped into hierarchical categories, e.g., clothing items are divided by gender, then by type (formal, casual, etc.). While the tree structure and the categories of the different items may be known in some applications, they have to be learned together with the embeddings in many others. In this work, we propose eTREE, a model that incorporates the (usually ignored) tree structure to enhance the quality of the embeddings. We leverage the special uniqueness properties of Nonnegative MF (NMF) to prove identifiability of eTREE. The proposed model not only exploits the tree structure prior, but also learns the hierarchical clustering in an unsupervised data-driven fashion. We derive an efficient algorithmic solution and a scalable implementation of eTREE that exploits parallel computing, computation caching, and warm start strategies. We showcase the effectiveness of eTREE on real data from various application domains: healthcare, recommender systems, and education. We also demonstrate the meaningfulness of the tree obtained from eTREE by means of domain experts interpretation."}

However, when using undirected PGMS with hidden variables, two sources of error typically compound in all but the simplest models (a) learning error (both computing the partition function and integrating out the hidden variables is intractable); and (b) prediction error (exact inference is also intractable). Here we introduce query training (QT), a mechanism to learn a PGM that is optimized for the approximate inference algorithm that will be paired with it. The resulting PGM is a worse model of the data (as measured by the likelihood), but it is tuned to produce better marginals for a given inference algorithm. Unlike prior works, our approach preserves the querying flexibility of the original PGM: at test time, we can estimate the marginal of any variable given any partial evidence. We demonstrate experimentally that QT can be used to learn a challenging 8-connected grid Markov random field with hidden variables and that it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art AdVIL when tested on three undirected models across multiple datasets."}

However, almost all existing deep subspace clustering methods only rely on target domain data, and always resort to shallow neural networks for modeling data, leaving huge room to design more effective representation learning mechanisms tailored for subspace clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel subspace clustering framework through learning precise sample representations. In contrast to previous approaches, the proposed method aims to leverage external data through constructing lots of relevant tasks to guide the training of the encoder, motivated by the idea of meta-learning. Considering limited layer structures of current deep subspace clustering models, we intend to distill knowledge from a deeper network trained on the external data, and transfer it into the shallower model. To reach the above two goals, we propose a new loss function to realize them in a joint framework. Moreover, we propose to construct a new pretext task for self-supervised training of the model, such that the representation ability of the model can be further improved. Extensive experiments are performed on four publicly available datasets, and experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our method, compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

In many clustering ensemble algorithms, the co-association matrix (CA matrix), which reflects the frequency of any two samples being partitioned into the same cluster, plays an important role. However, generally, the CA matrix is highly sparse with low value density, which may limit the performance of an algorithm based on it. To handle these issues, in this paper, we propose a growing tree model (GoT). In this model, the CA matrix is firstly refined by the shortest path technique so that its sparsity will be mitigated. Then, a set of representative prototype examples is discovered. Finally, to handle the low value density of the CA matrix, the prototypes gradually connect to their neighborhood, which likes a set of trees growing up. The rationality of the discovered prototype examples is illustrated by theoretical analysis and experimental analysis. The working mechanism of the GoT is visually shown on synthetic data sets. Experimental analyses on eight UCI data sets and eight image data sets show that the GoT outperforms nine representative clustering ensemble algorithms."}

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid quantum-classical framework for supervised quantum learning, which we call Variational Shadow Quantum Learning (VSQL). Our method in particular utilizes the classical shadows of quantum data, which fundamentally represent the side information of quantum data with respect to certain physical observables. Specifically, we first use variational shadow quantum circuits to extract classical features in a convolution way and then utilize a fully-connected neural network to complete the classification task. We show that this method could sharply reduce the number of parameters and thus better facilitate quantum circuit training. Simultaneously, less noise will be introduced since fewer quantum gates are employed in such shadow circuits. Moreover, we show that the Barren Plateau issue, a significant gradient vanishing problem in quantum machine learning, could be avoided in VSQL. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of VSQL in quantum classification via  numerical experiments on the classification of quantum states and the recognition of multi-labeled handwritten digits. In particular, our VSQL approach outperforms existing variational quantum classifiers in the test accuracy in the binary case of handwritten digit recognition and notably requires much fewer parameters."}

However, existing work on shapelets selection cannot be applied to multivariate time series classification (MTSC) since the candidate shapelets of MTSC may come from different variables of different lengths and thus cannot be directly compared. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel model called ShapeNet, which embeds shapelet candidates of different lengths into a unified space for shapelet selection. The network is trained using cluster-wise triplet loss, which considers the distance between anchor and multiple positive (negative) samples and the distance between positive (negative) samples, which are important for convergence. We compute representative and diversified final shapelets rather than directly using all the embeddings for model building to avoid a large fraction of non-discriminative shapelet candidates. We have conducted experiments on ShapeNet with competitive state-of-the-art and benchmark methods using UEA MTS datasets. The results show that the accuracy of ShapeNet is the best of all the methods compared. Furthermore, we illustrate the shapelets’ interpretability with two case studies."}

Unfortunately, obtaining large amounts of labeled data is expensive, and training state-of-the-art models (with hyperparameter tuning) requires significant computing resources and time. Secondly, real-world data is noisy and imbalanced. As a result, several recent papers try to make the training process more efficient and robust. However, most existing work either focuses on robustness or efficiency, but not both. In this work, we introduce GLISTER, a GeneraLIzation based data Subset selecTion for Efficient and Robust learning framework. We formulate GLISTER as a mixed discrete-continuous bi-level optimization problem to select a subset of the training data, which maximizes the log-likelihood on a held-out validation set. We then analyze GLISTER for simple classifiers such as gaussian and multinomial naive-bayes, k-nearest neighbor classifier, and linear regression and show connections to submodularity. Next, we propose an iterative online algorithm GLISTER-ONLINE, which performs data selection iteratively along with the parameter updates, and can be applied to any loss-based learning algorithm. We then show that for a rich class of loss functions including cross-entropy, hinge-loss, squared-loss, and logistic-loss, the inner discrete data selection is an instance of (weakly) submodular optimization, and we analyze conditions for which GLISTER-ONLINE reduces the validation loss and converges. Finally, we propose GLISTER-ACTIVE, an extension to batch active learning, and we empirically demonstrate the performance of GLISTER on a wide range of tasks including, (a) data selection to reduce training time, (b) robust learning under label noise and imbalance settings, and (c) batch-active learning with a number of deep and shallow models. We show that our framework improves upon the state of the art both in efficiency and accuracy (in cases (a) and (c)) and is more efficient compared to other state-of-the-art robust learning algorithms in case (b).

Initiated by Learning without Forgetting (LwF), many of the existing works report that knowledge distillation is effective to preserve the previous knowledge, and hence they commonly use a soft label for the old task, namely a knowledge distillation (KD) loss, together with a class label for the new task, namely a cross entropy (CE) loss, to form a composite loss for a single neural network. However, this approach suffers from learning the knowledge by a CE loss as a KD loss often more strongly influences the objective function when they are in a competitive situation within a single network. This could be a critical problem particularly in a class incremental scenario, where the knowledge across tasks as well as within the new task, both of which can only be acquired by a CE loss, is essentially learned due to the existence of a unified classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method, called Split-and-Bridge, which can successfully address the above problem by partially splitting a neural network into two partitions for training the new task separated from the old task and re-connecting them for learning the knowledge across tasks. In our thorough experimental analysis, our Split-and-Bridge method outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in KD-based continual learning."}

Our choice for a baseline method is physics-informed neural network (PINN) because the method parameterizes not only the solutions, but also the equations that describe the dynamics of physical processes. We demonstrate that PINN performs poorly on extrapolation tasks in many benchmark problems.

While such a transformation is invertible, its Jacobian is very sparse and thus may lack expressiveness. This work presents a simple remedy by noting that subdivision and (affine) coupling  can be repeated recursively within the resulting subsets, leading to an efficiently invertible block with dense, triangular Jacobian. By formulating our recursive coupling scheme via a hierarchical architecture, HINT allows sampling from a joint distribution p(y,x) and the corresponding posterior p(x|y) using a single invertible network. We evaluate our method on some standard data sets and benchmark its full power for density estimation and Bayesian inference on a novel data set of 2D shapes in Fourier parameterization, which enables consistent visualization of samples for different dimensionalities."}

Despite its excellent performance, it does not consider the interaction between positions across channels and layers, which is crucial in fine-grained classification tasks. To address the limitation, we target at singer identification (SID) task and present a fully generalized non-local (FGNL) module to help identify fine-grained vocals. Specifically, we first propose a FGNL operation, which extends the NL operation to explore the correlations between positions across channels and layers. Secondly, we further apply a depth-wise convolution with Gaussian kernel in the FGNL operation to smooth feature maps for better generalization. More, we modify the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) scheme into the FGNL module to adaptively emphasize correlated feature channels to help uncover relevant feature responses and eventually the target singer. Evaluating results on the benchmark artist20 dataset shows that the FGNL module significantly improves the accuracy of the deep-net models in SID.

The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN.  The architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output. The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores to those of state-of-the-art β-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover, the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often better than those by β-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA and 3D Chairs dataset."}

Most studies manually tie intermediate features of the teacher and student, and transfer knowledge through predefined links. However, manual selection often constructs ineffective links that limit the improvement from the distillation. There has been an attempt to address the problem, but it is still challenging to identify effective links under practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an effective and efficient feature distillation method utilizing all the feature levels of the teacher without manually selecting the links. Specifically, our method utilizes an attention based meta network that learns relative similarities between features, and applies identified similarities to control distillation intensities of all possible pairs. As a result, our method determines competent links more efficiently than the previous approach and provides better performance on model compression and transfer learning tasks.

Nowadays deep learning-based methods have shown significant success in XMC. However, the existing methods (e.g., AttentionXML and X-Transformer etc) still suffer from 1) combining several models to train and predict for one dataset, and 2) sampling negative labels statically during the process of training label ranking model, which will harm the performance and accuracy of model. To address the above problems, we propose LightXML, which adopts end-to-end training and dynamical negative labels sampling. In LightXML, we use GAN like networks to recall and rank labels. The label recalling part will generate negative and positive labels, and the label ranking part will distinguish positive labels from these labels. Based on these networks, negative labels are sampled dynamically during label ranking part training. With feeding both label recalling and ranking parts with the same text representation, LightXML can reach high performance. Extensive experiments show that LightXML outperforms state-of-the-art methods in five extreme multi-label datasets with much smaller model size and lower computational complexity. In particular, on the Amazon dataset with  670K labels, LightXML can reduce the model size up to 72% compared to AttentionXML. Our code is available at http://github.com/kongds/LightXML."}

These successes motivate us to bring the mechanism of MARL into  the Multi-agent Resilient Consensus (MARC) problem  that studies the consensus problem in a network of agents with faulty ones. Relying on the natural characteristics of the system goal, the key component in MARL, reward function, can thus be directly constructed via the relative distance among agents. Firstly, we apply Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) on each single agent to train and learn adjacent weights of neighboring agents in a distributed manner, that we call Distributed-DDPG (D-DDPG), so as to minimize the weights from suspicious agents and eliminate the corresponding influences. Secondly, to get rid of neural networks and their time-consuming training process, a Q-learning based algorithm, called Q-consensus, is further presented by building a proper reward function and a credibility function for each pair of neighboring agents so that the adjacent weights  can update in an adaptive way. The experimental results indicate that both algorithms perform well with appearance of constant and/or random faulty agents, yet the Q-consensus algorithm outperforms the faulty ones running D-DDPG. Compared to the traditional resilient consensus strategies, e.g., Weighted-Mean-Subsequence-Reduced (W-MSR) or trustworthiness analysis, the proposed Q-consensus algorithm has greatly relaxed the topology requirements, as well as reduced the storage and computation loads. Finally, a smart-car hardware platform consisting of six vehicles is used to verify the effectiveness of the Q-consensus algorithm by achieving resilient velocity synchronization."}

Numerous network compression methods such as pruning and quantization are proposed to reduce the model size significantly, of which the key is to find suitable compression allocation (e.g., pruning sparsity and quantization codebook) of each layer.  Existing solutions obtain the compression allocation in an iterative/manual fashion while finetuning the compressed model, thus suffering from the efficiency issue. Different from the prior art, we propose a novel One-shot Pruning-Quantization (OPQ) in this paper, which analytically solves the compression allocation with pre-trained weight parameters only. During finetuning, the compression module is fixed and only weight parameters are updated. To our knowledge, OPQ is the first work that reveals pre-trained model is sufficient for solving pruning and quantization simultaneously, without any complex iterative/manual optimization at the finetuning stage. Furthermore, we propose a unified channel-wise quantization method that enforces all channels of each layer to share a common codebook, which leads to low bit-rate allocation without introducing extra overhead brought by traditional channel-wise quantization. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet with AlexNet/MobileNet-V1/ResNet-50 show that our method improves accuracy and training efficiency while obtains significantly higher compression rates compared to the state-of-the-art."}

They, however, are conducted independently, and very few works try to connect the two. For unlabeled data exploitation, state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning (SSL) results have been achieved via encouraging the consistency of model output on data perturbation, that is, consistency assumption. However, it remains hard for users to understand how particular decisions are made by state-of-the-art SSL models. To this end, in this paper we first disclose that the consistency assumption is closely related to causality invariance, where causality invariance lies in the main reason why the consistency assumption is valid. We then propose ECT (Explanation Consistency Training) which encourages a consistent reason of model decision under data perturbation. ECT employs model explanation as a surrogate of the causality of model output, which is able to bridge state-of-the-art interpretability to SSL models and alleviate the high complexity of causality. We realize ECT-SM for vision and ECT-ATT for NLP tasks. Experimental results on real-world data sets validate the highly competitive performance and better explanation of the proposed algorithms."}

We synthesise a human-interpretable automaton from trace data collected by exploring the environment. The state space of the environment is then enriched with the synthesised automaton so that the generation of a control policy by deep RL is guided by the discovered structure encoded in the automaton. The proposed approach is able to cope  with both high-dimensional, low-level features and unknown sparse non-Markovian rewards. We have evaluated DeepSynth's performance in a set of experiments that includes the Atari game Montezuma's Revenge.

The analytical formulation usually takes the form of a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). We focus on the case where the CMDP is unknown, and RL algorithms obtain samples to discover the model and compute an optimal constrained policy.  Our goal is to characterize the relationship between safety constraints and the number of samples needed to ensure a desired level of accuracy---both objective maximization and constraint satisfaction---in a PAC sense.  We explore two classes of RL algorithms, namely, (i) a generative model based approach, wherein samples are taken initially to estimate a model, and (ii) an online approach, wherein the model is updated as samples are obtained.  Our main finding is that compared to the best known bounds of the unconstrained regime, the sample complexity of constrained RL algorithms are increased by a factor that is logarithmic in the number of constraints, which suggests that the approach may be easily utilized in real systems."}

For example, to learn a model for deciding whom to give a loan, the available training data includes individuals who were given a loan in the past, but not those who were not. This missingness, if ignored, nullifies any fairness guarantee of the training procedure when the model is deployed. Using causal graphs, we characterize the missingness mechanisms in different real-world scenarios. We show conditions under which various distributions, used in popular fairness algorithms, can or can not be recovered from the training data. Our theoretical results imply that many of these algorithms can not guarantee fairness in practice. Modeling missingness also helps to identify correct design principles for fair algorithms. For example, in multi-stage settings where decisions are made in multiple screening rounds, we use our framework to derive the minimal distributions required to design a fair algorithm. Our proposed algorithm also decentralizes the decision-making process and still achieves similar performance to the optimal algorithm that requires centralization and non-recoverable distributions."}
{"Type": "conference", "Year": "2021", "Area": "AI", "Where": "AAAI", "Abbreviation": "HiGAN", "Title": "Handwriting Imitation Conditioned on Arbitrary-Length Texts and Disentangled Styles", "Abstract": "Given limited handwriting scripts, humans can easily visualize (or imagine) what the handwritten words/texts would look like with other arbitrary textual contents. Moreover, a person also is able to imitate the handwriting styles of provided reference samples. Humans can do such hallucinations, perhaps because they can learn to disentangle the calligraphic styles and textual contents from given handwriting scripts. However, computers cannot study to do such flexible handwriting imitation with existing techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel handwriting imitation generative adversarial network (HiGAN) to mimic such hallucinations. Specifically, HiGAN can generate variable-length handwritten words/texts conditioned on arbitrary textual contents, which are unconstrained to any predefined corpus or out-of-vocabulary words. Moreover, HiGAN can flexibly control the handwriting styles of synthetic images by disentangling calligraphic styles from the reference samples. Experiments on handwriting benchmarks validate our superiority in terms of visual quality and scalability when comparing to the state-of-the-art methods for handwritten word/text synthesis. The code and pre-trained models can be found at https://github.com/ganji15/HiGAN."}
