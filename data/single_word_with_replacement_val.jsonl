They are effective in this goal to some extent, but generally present a rather simplistic one-dimensional view of the submitted systems, communicated only through holistic accuracy numbers. In this paper, we present a new conceptualization and implementation of NLP evaluation: the <MASKED_ACRONYM>, which in addition to inheriting the functionality of the standard leaderboard, also allows researchers to (i) diagnose strengths and weaknesses of a single system (e.g. what is the best-performing system bad at?) (ii) interpret relationships between multiple systems. (e.g. where does system A outperform system B? What if we combine systems A, B and C?) and (iii) examine prediction results closely (e.g. what are common errors made by multiple systems or in what contexts do particular errors occur?). So far, <MASKED_ACRONYM> covers more than 400 systems, 50 datasets, 40 languages, and 12 tasks. We not only released an online platform at the website but also make our evaluation tool an API with MIT Licence at Github and PyPi that allows users to conveniently assess their models offline. We additionally release all output files from systems that we have run or collected to motivate \u201coutput-driven\u201d research in the future.","wordlikeness":0.8461538462,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":0.7272727273}

Taxonomy (Zamir et al., 2018) finds that a structure exists among visual tasks, as a principle underlying transfer learning for them. In this paper, we propose a cognitively inspired framework, <MASKED_ACRONYM>, to learn taxonomy for NLP tasks.

The former employs Representational Similarity Analysis, which is commonly used in computational neuroscience to find a correlation between brain-activity measurement and computational modeling, to estimate task similarity with task-specific sentence representations. The latter learns to detect task relations by projecting neural representations from NLP models to cognitive signals (i.e., fMRI voxels). Experiments on 12 NLP tasks, where BERT\/TinyBERT are used as the underlying models for transfer learning, demonstrate that the proposed CogTaxonomy is able to guide transfer learning, achieving performance competitive to the Analytic Hierarchy Process (Saaty, 1987) used in visual Taskonomy (Zamir et al., 2018) but without requiring exhaustive pairwise <span class=tex-math>O(m<sup>2<\/sup>)<\/span> task transferring.

An interesting fact is that NLG and Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) are a natural dual problem pair. Suppose the response generated by the NLG module can be restored to the corresponding dialogue act by the SLU module, which reflects that the generated response fully conveys the semantic information of the dialogue act. Based on this idea, a novel Dual Supervised Pre-trained Model for a few-shot Natural Language Generation (<MASKED_ACRONYM>) is proposed to regularize the pre-training process. We adopt a joint model with a dual supervised framework to learn the dual correlation between NLG and SLU from the perspective of probability.

This calculation, however, requires manual transcription of the speech signal to obtain the ground truth. Since transcribing audio signals is a costly process, Automatic WER Evaluation (e-WER) methods have been developed to automatically predict the WER of a speech system by only relying on the transcription and the speech signal features. While WER is a continuous variable, previous works have shown that positing e-WER as a classification problem is more effective than regression. However, while converting to a classification setting, these approaches suffer from heavy class imbalance. In this paper, we propose a new balanced paradigm for e-WER in a classification setting. Within this paradigm, we also propose <MASKED_ACRONYM>, a BERT based architecture with speech features for e-WER. Furthermore, we introduce a distance loss function to tackle the ordinal nature of e-WER classification.

However, collecting and labeling large-scale datasets is time-consuming and expensive for many scenarios and languages. Therefore, sufficient labeled pairs are usually not available. To deal with the label shortage problem, we present a simple yet effective zero-shot approach <MASKED_ACRONYM> that can generate visual captions for different scenarios and languages without any labeled vision-caption pairs of downstream datasets. In the training stage, <MASKED_ACRONYM> only requires text data for input. Then it conducts two main steps: 1) retrieving concept prompts that preserve the corresponding domain knowledge of new scenarios; 2) auto-encoding the prompts to learn writing styles to output captions in a desired language. In the testing stage, <MASKED_ACRONYM> instead takes visual data as input directly to retrieve the concept prompts to generate the final visual descriptions. The extensive experiments on image and video captioning across four benchmarks and four languages (i.e., English, Chinese, German, and French) confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

Most active learning approaches for Machine Translation assume the existence of a pool of sentences in a source language, and rely on human annotators to provide translations or post-edits, which can still be costly. In this article, we apply active learning to a real-world human-in-the-loop scenario in which we assume that: (1) the source sentences may not be readily available, but instead arrive in a stream; (2) the automatic translations receive feedback in the form of a rating, instead of a correct\/edited translation, since the human-in-the-loop might be a user looking for a translation, but not be able to provide one. To tackle the challenge of deciding whether each incoming pair source\u2013translations is worthy to query for human feedback, we resort to a number of stream-based active learning query strategies. Moreover, because we do not know in advance which query strategy will be the most adequate for a certain language pair and set of Machine Translation models, we propose to dynamically combine multiple strategies using prediction with expert advice. Our experiments on different language pairs and feedback settings show that using active learning allows us to converge on the best Machine Translation systems with fewer human interactions. Furthermore, combining multiple strategies using prediction with expert advice outperforms several individual active learning strategies with even fewer interactions, particularly in partial feedback settings.","wordlikeness":0.8888888889,"lcsratio":0.7777777778,"wordcoverage":0.9473684211}

Pre-training and fine-tuning framework has been effectively used to tackle texts in various formats, including plain texts, document texts, and web texts. Despite achieving promising performance, existing pre-trained models usually target one specific document format at one time, making it difficult to combine knowledge from multiple document formats. To address this, we propose <MASKED_ACRONYM>, a unified pre-trained model which deals with different document formats in a single model. For parameter efficiency, we share backbone parameters for different formats such as the word embedding layer and the Transformer layers. Meanwhile, we introduce adaptive layers with lightweight parameters to enhance the distinction across different formats. Experimental results have demonstrated that with only 36.7% parameters, <MASKED_ACRONYM> achieves comparable or even better performance on a variety of downstream tasks compared with the individual pre-trained models, which is cost effective for real-world deployment.

ICSI meeting corpus is a publicly released data set of multi-party meetings in an organization that has been released over a decade ago, and has been fostering meeting understanding research since then. The original data collection includes transcription of participant turns as well as meta-data annotations, such as disfluencies and dialog act tags. This paper presents an extended set of annotations for the ICSI meeting corpus with a goal of deeply understanding meeting conversations, where participant turns are annotated by actionable items that could be performed by an automated meeting assistant. In addition to the user utterances that contain an actionable item, annotations also include the arguments associated with the actionable item. The set of actionable items are determined by aligning human-human interactions to human-machine interactions, where a data annotation schema designed for a virtual personal assistant (human-machine genre) is adapted to the meetings domain (human-human genre). The data set is formed by annotating participants\u2019 utterances in meetings with potential intents\/actions considering their contexts. The set of actions target what could be accomplished by an automated meeting assistant, such as taking a note of action items that a participant commits to, or finding emails or topic related documents that were mentioned during the meeting. A total of 10 defined intents\/actions are considered as actionable items in meetings. Turns that include actionable intents were annotated for 22 public ICSI meetings, that include a total of 21K utterances, segmented by speaker turns.

In the Natural Language Processing field, the state of the art concerning automatic document classification tasks relies on word and sentence embeddings built upon deep learning models based on transformers that have outperformed the competition in several tasks. However, the models built from these embeddings are usually difficult to interpret. On the contrary, linguistic features are easy to understand, they result in simpler models, and they usually achieve encouraging results. Moreover, both linguistic features and embeddings can be combined with different strategies which result in more reliable machine-learning models. The de facto tool for extracting linguistic features in Spanish is LIWC. However, this software does not consider specific linguistic phenomena of Spanish such as grammatical gender and lacks certain verb tenses. In order to solve these drawbacks, we have developed <MASKED_ACRONYM>, a linguistic extraction tool designed from scratch for Spanish. Furthermore, this tool has been validated to conduct different experiments in areas such as infodemiology, hate-speech detection, author profiling, authorship verification, humour or irony detection, among others.

While adaptive pre-training of PLMs can help them obtain domain-specific knowledge, it requires a large training cost. Moreover, adaptive pre-training can harm the PLM\u2019s performance on the downstream task by causing catastrophic forgetting of its general knowledge. To overcome such limitations of adaptive pre-training for PLM adaption, we propose a novel domain adaption framework for PLMs coined as Knowledge-Augmented Language model Adaptation (<MASKED_ACRONYM>), which modulates the intermediate hidden representations of PLMs with domain knowledge, consisting of entities and their relational facts.

However, two pain points persist for this paradigm: (a) as the pre-trained models grow bigger (e.g., 175B parameters for GPT-3), even the fine-tuning process can be time-consuming and computationally expensive; (b) the fine-tuned model has the same size as its starting point by default, which is neither sensible due to its more specialized functionality, nor practical since many fine-tuned models will be deployed in resource-constrained environments. To address these pain points, we propose a framework for resource- and parameter-efficient fine-tuning by leveraging the sparsity prior in both weight updates and the final model weights. Our proposed framework, dubbed Dually Sparsity-Embedded Efficient Tuning (<MASKED_ACRONYM>), aims to achieve two key objectives: (i) parameter efficient fine-tuning - by enforcing sparsity-aware low-rank updates on top of the pre-trained weights; and (ii) resource-efficient inference - by encouraging a sparse weight structure towards the final fine-tuned model. We leverage sparsity in these two directions by exploiting both unstructured and structured sparse patterns in pre-trained language models viaa unified approach. Extensive experiments and in-depth investigations, with diverse network backbones (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2) on dozens of datasets, consistently demonstrate impressive parameter-\/inference-efficiency, while maintaining competitive downstream performance.

In text-to-table, given a text, one creates a table or several tables expressing the main content of the text, while the model is learned from text-table pair data. The problem setting differs from those of the existing methods for IE. First, the extraction can be carried out from long texts to large tables with complex structures. Second, the extraction is entirely data-driven, and there is no need to explicitly define the schemas. As far as we know, there has been no previous work that studies the problem. In this work, we formalize text-to-table as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) problem. We first employ a seq2seq model fine-tuned from a pre-trained language model to perform the task. We also develop a new method within the seq2seq approach, exploiting two additional techniques in table generation: table constraint and table relation embeddings. We consider text-to-table as an inverse problem of the well-studied table-to-text, and make use of four existing table-to-text datasets in our experiments on text-to-table. Experimental results show that the vanilla seq2seq model can outperform the baseline methods of using relation extraction and named entity extraction. The results also show that our method can further boost the performances of the vanilla seq2seq model. We further discuss the main challenges of the proposed task.

In the scientific domain where publishers might use these models to examine manuscripts under submission, misclassification has the potential to cause harm to authors. Additionally, authors may appropriately use text generation models such as with the use of assistive technologies like translation tools. In this setting, a binary classification scheme might be used to flag appropriate uses of assistive text generation technology as simply machine generated which is a cause of concern. In our work, we simulate this scenario by presenting a state-of-the-art detector trained on the DAGPap22 with machine translated passages from Scielo and find that the model performs at random. Given this finding, we develop a framework for dataset development that provides a nuanced approach to detecting machine generated text by having labels for the type of technology used such as for translation or paraphrase resulting in the construction of <MASKED_ACRONYM>. By training the same model that performed well on DAGPap22 on <MASKED_ACRONYM>, we show that not only is the model more robust to domain shifts but also is able to uncover the type of technology used for machine generated text. Despite this, we conclude that current datasets are neither comprehensive nor realistic enough to understand how these models would perform in the wild where manuscript submissions can come from many unknown or novel distributions, how they would perform on scientific full-texts rather than small passages, and what might happen when there is a mix of appropriate and inappropriate uses of natural language generation.","wordlikeness":0.5,"lcsratio":0.6,"wordcoverage":0.6666666667}

In this paper, we propose <MASKED_ACRONYM>, a new retrieval-augmented neural commit message generation method, which treats the retrieved similar commit as an exemplar and leverages it to generate an accurate commit message. As the retrieved commit message may not always accurately describe the content\/intent of the current code diff, we also propose an exemplar guider, which learns the semantic similarity between the retrieved and current code diff and then guides the generation of commit message based on the similarity. We conduct extensive experiments on a large public dataset with five programming languages. Experimental results show that <MASKED_ACRONYM> can outperform all baselines.

Current models with state-of-the-art performance employ the stepwise method that adds an individual node to the proof step-by-step. However, these methods actually focus on generating several proof paths rather than a whole tree. During generation, they focus on the most relevant areas of the currently generated node while neglecting the rest of the proof tree. To address this problem, we propose <MASKED_ACRONYM>, which generates the proof tree via iterative hierarchical inference. At each step, <MASKED_ACRONYM> adds the entire layer to the proof, where all nodes in this layer are generated simultaneously. Since the conventional autoregressive generation architecture cannot simultaneously predict multiple nodes, <MASKED_ACRONYM> employs text-to-text paradigm. To this end, we propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm to encode the proof tree as the plain text without losing structure information. Experimental results show that <MASKED_ACRONYM> significantly improves performance on several widely-used datasets.

We establish strong baselines on the <MASKED_ACRONYM> dataset using the Berkeley Neural Parser with transformer-based pre-trained embeddings, with the best performance of 88.85% F1 score coming from our own version of SpanBERT (IndoSpanBERT). We further analyze the predictions made by our best-performing model to reveal certain idiosyncrasies in the Indonesian language that pose challenges for constituency parsing.","wordlikeness":1.0,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":1.0}

For the past decade, researchers apply the multi-instance learning (MIL) framework to find the most reliable feature from a bag of sentences. Although the pattern of MIL bags can greatly reduce DS noise, it fails to represent many other useful sentence features in the datasets. In many cases, these sentence features can only be acquired by extra sentence-level human annotation with heavy costs. Therefore, the performance of distantly supervised RE models is bounded. In this paper, we go beyond typical MIL framework and propose a novel contrastive instance learning (<MASKED_ACRONYM>) framework. Specifically, we regard the initial MIL as the relational triple encoder and constraint positive pairs against negative pairs for each instance. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, with significant improvements over the previous methods on NYT10, GDS and KBP.","wordlikeness":0.6666666667,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":0.8}

Most of the past work on attribute extraction is not scalable as they rely on manually curated training data, either with or without use of active learning. We rely on distant supervision for training data generation, removing dependency on manual labels. One issue with distant supervision is that it leads to incomplete training annotation due to missing attribute values while matching. We propose a multi-task learning architecture to deal with missing labels in the training data, leading to F1 improvement of 9.2% for numeric attributes over state-of-the-art single-task architecture. While multi-task architecture benefits both numeric and non-numeric attributes, we present automated techniques to further improve the numeric attributes extraction models. Numeric attributes require a list of units (or aliases) for better matching with distant supervision. We propose an automated algorithm for alias creation using unstructured text and attribute values, leading to a 20.2% F1 improvement. Extensive experiments on real world datasets for 20 numeric attributes across 5 product categories and 3 English marketplaces show that LATEX-numeric achieves a high F1-score, without any manual intervention, making it suitable for practical applications.

Previous work has proposed several approaches to debunk such features and reduce their impact on the learned models. In this work, a normalization strategy is proposed to eliminate the false features caused by the textual surfaces of noun phrases. The motivation for this strategy is that noun phrases often play the role of slots in textual expressions and their exact forms are often not that important for performing the final task. As an intuitive example, consider the expression \u201d<span class=tex-math>x <span class=font-weight-normal>like eating<\/span> y<\/span>\". There are a huge number of suitable instantiations for <span class=tex-math>x<\/span> and <span class=tex-math>y<\/span> in the locale. However, humans can already infer the sentiment polarity of <span class=tex-math>x<\/span> toward <span class=tex-math>y<\/span> without knowing their exact forms.Based on this intuition, we introduce <MASKED_ACRONYM>, a pretrained language model based network, to implement the normalization strategy. <MASKED_ACRONYM> learns to replace as many noun phrases in the input sentence as possible with pre-defined base forms. The output of <MASKED_ACRONYM> is then fed as input to a prompt-based learning model to perform label prediction. To evaluate the effectiveness of our strategy, we conducted experimental studies on several tasks, including aspect sentiment classification (ASC), semantic text similarity (STS), and natural language inference (NLI). The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our strategy.","wordlikeness":0.8571428571,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":0.7692307692}

For alignment, we consider tracks as comparable corpora and first apply an existing algorithm for aligning such corpora based on dynamic time warping and TFIDF-based similarity scores. We improve this baseline algorithm using contextual information, WordNet-based word similarity and scene location information. We report the performance of these algorithms on a manually aligned subset of the data.

As machine translation systems improve in lexical choice and fluency, the shortcomings of widespread n-gram based, fluency-oriented MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU, which fail to properly evaluate adequacy, become more apparent. But more accurate, nonautomatic adequacy-oriented MT evaluation metrics like HTER are highly labor-intensive, which bottlenecks the evaluation cycle. We first show that when using untrained monolingual readers to annotate semantic roles in MT output, the non-automatic version of the metric H<MASKED_ACRONYM> achieves a 0.43 correlation coefficient with human adequacy judgments at the sentence level, far superior to BLEU at only 0.20, and equal to the far more expensive HTER. We then replace the human semantic role annotators with automatic shallow semantic parsing to further automate the evaluation metric, and show that even the semiautomated evaluation metric achieves a 0.34 correlation coefficient with human adequacy judgment, which is still about 80% as closely correlated as HTER despite an even lower labor cost for the evaluation procedure. The results show that our proposed metric is significantly better correlated with human judgment on adequacy than current widespread automatic evaluation metrics, while being much more cost effective than HTER.","wordlikeness":1.0,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":1.0}

While traditionally these relations were modeled via formal schemata, the recent QA-SRL paradigm (and its extensions) present appealing advantages of capturing such relations through intuitive natural language question-answer (QA) pairs. In this paper, we extend the QA-based semantics framework to cover adjectival predicates, which carry important information in many downstream settings yet have been scarcely addressed in NLP research. Firstly, based on some prior literature and empirical assessment, we propose capturing four types of core adjectival arguments, through corresponding question types. Notably, our coverage goes beyond prior annotations of adjectival arguments, while also explicating valuable implicit arguments. Next, we develop an extensive data annotation methodology, involving controlled crowdsourcing and targeted expert review. Following, we create a high-quality dataset, consisting of 9K adjective mentions with 12K predicate-argument instances (QAs). Finally, we present and analyze baseline models based on text-to-text language modeling, indicating challenges for future research, particularly regarding the scarce argument types. Overall, we suggest that our contributions can provide the basis for research on contemporary modeling of adjectival information.","wordlikeness":0.1666666667,"lcsratio":0.8333333333,"wordcoverage":0.6}

Among those, translating embedding approaches enjoy the advantages of light-weight structure, high efficiency and great interpretability. Especially when extended to complex vector space, they show the capability in handling various relation patterns including symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion and composition. However, previous translating embedding approaches defined in complex vector space suffer from two main issues: 1) representing and modeling capacities of the model are limited by the translation function with rigorous multiplication of two complex numbers; and 2) embedding ambiguity caused by one-to-many relations is not explicitly alleviated. In this paper, we propose a relation-adaptive translation function built upon a novel weighted product in complex space, where the weights are learnable, relation-specific and independent to embedding size. The translation function only requires eight more scalar parameters each relation, but improves expressive power and alleviates embedding ambiguity problem. Based on the function, we then present our Relation-adaptive translating Embedding (<MASKED_ACRONYM>) approach to score each graph triple. Moreover, a novel negative sampling method is proposed to utilize both prior knowledge and self-adversarial learning for effective optimization.

This kind of methods insert templates into the input and convert the classification task to a (masked) language modeling problem. With this inspiration, we propose a novel method Fine-tuning with Prompt Curriculum (<MASKED_ACRONYM>) for RE, with two distinctive characteristics: the relation prompt learning, introducing an auxiliary prompt-based fine-tuning task to make the model capture the semantics of relation labels; the prompt learning curriculum, a fine-tuning procedure including an increasingly difficult task to adapt the model to the difficult multi-task setting.

One particular hindrance to research on this problem is the non-availability of resources and tools. Majority of the earlier works in misinformation detection are based on English content which confines the applicability of the research to a specific language only. Increasing presence of multimedia content on the web has promoted misinformation in which real multimedia content (images, videos) are used in different but related contexts with manipulated texts to mislead the readers. Detecting this category of misleading information is almost impossible without any prior knowledge. Studies say that emotion-invoking and highly novel content accelerates the dissemination of false information.

Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose <MASKED_ACRONYM> to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods.

Both phenomena present a challenge for NLP. Recently, the advent of contextualized word embeddings has led to success on tasks involving lexical ambiguity, such as Word Sense Disambiguation. However, there are few tasks that directly evaluate how well these contextualized embeddings accommodate the more continuous, dynamic nature of word meaning\u2014-particularly in a way that matches human intuitions. We introduce <MASKED_ACRONYM>, a dataset of graded, human relatedness judgments for 112 ambiguous words in context (with 672 sentence pairs total), as well as human estimates of sense dominance. The average inter-annotator agreement (assessed using a leave-one-annotator-out method) was 0.79. We then show that a measure of cosine distance, computed using contextualized embeddings from BERT and ELMo, correlates with human judgments, but that cosine distance also systematically underestimates how similar humans find uses of the same sense of a word to be, and systematically overestimates how similar humans find uses of different-sense homonyms.

However, current geometric-based methods depend on the neural approach to model FOL operators (conjunction, disjunction and negation), which are not easily explainable with considerable computation cost. We overcome this challenge by introducing a symbolic modeling approach for the FOL operators, emphasizing the direct calculation of the intersection between geometric shapes, particularly sector-cones in the embedding space, to model the conjunction operator. This approach reduces the computation cost as a non-neural approach is involved in the core logic operators. Moreover, we propose to accelerate the learning in the relation projection operator using the neural approach to emphasize the essential role of this operator in all query structures. Although empirical evidence for explainability is challenging, our approach demonstrates a significant improvement in answering complex logical queries (both non-negative and negative FOL forms) over previous geometric-based models.","wordlikeness":0.6,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":0.8888888889}

Due to the annotation complexity, the data scale of existing datasets is limited, which cannot well train and evaluate data-hungry models. (2) Absence of unified annotation. Different types of event relations naturally interact with each other, but existing datasets only cover limited relation types at once, which prevents models from taking full advantage of relation interactions. To address these issues, we construct a unified large-scale human-annotated ERE dataset <MASKED_ACRONYM> with improved annotation schemes.

In this paper we present the NLP architecture <MASKED_ACRONYM>, designed to assist computational linguists in the whole process of the development of resources in an industrial context: from corpora compilation to quality assurance. To add new words more easily to the morphosyntactic lexica, a guesser that lemmatizes and assigns morphosyntactic tags as well as inflection paradigms to a new word has been developed. Moreover, different control mechanisms are set up to check the coherence and consistency of the resources. Today <MASKED_ACRONYM> manages resources in five European languages: French, English, Spanish, Italian and Polish. Chinese and Portuguese are in process. The development of <MASKED_ACRONYM> has followed an incremental strategy.

Research efforts have been made to automatically identify bots based on texts and networks on social media. Existing methods only leverage texts or networks alone, and while few works explored the shallow combination of the two modalities, we hypothesize that the interaction and information exchange between texts and graphs could be crucial for holistically evaluating bot activities on social media. In addition, according to a recent survey (Cresci, 2020), Twitter bots are constantly evolving while advanced bots steal genuine users\u2019 tweets and dilute their malicious content to evade detection. This results in greater inconsistency across the timeline of novel Twitter bots, which warrants more attention. In light of these challenges, we propose <MASKED_ACRONYM>, a Twitter Bot detection framework with text-graph Interaction and semantic Consistency. Specifically, in addition to separately modeling the two modalities on social media, <MASKED_ACRONYM> employs a text-graph interaction module to enable information exchange across modalities in the learning process. In addition, given the stealing behavior of novel Twitter bots, <MASKED_ACRONYM> proposes to model semantic consistency in tweets based on attention weights while using it to augment the decision process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that <MASKED_ACRONYM> consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two widely adopted datasets. Further analyses reveal that text-graph interactions and modeling semantic consistency are essential improvements and help combat bot evolution.","wordlikeness":1.0,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":0.8}

However, optimizing for a specific metric reward leads to improvements in mostly that metric only, suggesting that the model is gaming the formulation of that metric in a particular way without often achieving real qualitative improvements. Hence, it is more beneficial to make the model optimize multiple diverse metric rewards jointly. While appealing, this is challenging because one needs to manually decide the importance and scaling weights of these metric rewards. Further, it is important to consider using a dynamic combination and curriculum of metric rewards that flexibly changes over time. Considering the above aspects, in our work, we automate the optimization of multiple metric rewards simultaneously via a multi-armed bandit approach (<MASKED_ACRONYM>), where at each round, the bandit chooses which metric reward to optimize next, based on expected arm gains. We use the Exp3 algorithm for bandits and formulate two approaches for bandit rewards: (1) Single Multi-reward Bandit (SM-Bandit); (2) Hierarchical Multi-reward Bandit (HM-Bandit). We empirically show the effectiveness of our approaches via various automatic metrics and human evaluation on two important NLG tasks: question generation and data-to-text generation.

This text, however, does not follow the standard rules of writing. Moreover, the use of dialect such as Moroccan Arabic in written communications increases further NLP tasks complexity. A dialect is a verbal language that does not have a standard orthography. The written dialect is based on the phonetic transliteration of spoken words which leads users to improvise spelling while writing. Thus, for the same word we can find multiple forms of transliterations. Subsequently, it is mandatory to normalize these different transliterations to one canonical word form. To reach this goal, we have exploited the powerfulness of word embedding models generated with a corpus of YouTube comments.

To facilitate information retrieval, curators in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) assign a set of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to each article. MeSH is a hierarchically-organized vocabulary, containing about 28K different concepts, covering the fields from clinical medicine to information sciences. Several automatic MeSH indexing models have been developed to improve the time-consuming and financially expensive manual annotation, including the NLM official tool \u2013 Medical Text Indexer, and the winner of BioASQ Task5a challenge \u2013 DeepMeSH. However, these models are complex and not interpretable.

However, previous studies concentrate on the token or sentence level, such as sentence sentiment and formality transfer, but neglect long style transfer at the discourse level. Long texts usually involve more complicated author linguistic preferences such as discourse structures than sentences. In this paper, we formulate the task of non-parallel story author-style transfer, which requires transferring an input story into a specified author style while maintaining source semantics. To tackle this problem, we propose a generation model, named <MASKED_ACRONYM>, which leverages discourse representations to capture source content information and transfer them to target styles with learnable style embeddings. We use an additional training objective to disentangle stylistic features from the learned discourse representation to prevent the model from degenerating to an auto-encoder. Moreover, to enhance content preservation, we design a mask-and-fill framework to explicitly fuse style-specific keywords of source texts into generation. Furthermore, we constructed new datasets for this task in Chinese and English, respectively. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms strong baselines in overall performance of style transfer and content preservation.","wordlikeness":0.9,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":0.7058823529}

In this paper, we explore how this generation can be further controlled at decoding time to satisfy certain constraints (e.g. being non-toxic, conveying certain emotions, using a specific writing style, etc.) without fine-tuning the LM.Precisely, we formalize constrained generation as a tree exploration process guided by a discriminator that indicates how well the associated sequence respects the constraint. This approach, in addition to being easier and cheaper to train than fine-tuning the LM, allows to apply the constraint more finely and dynamically. We propose several original methods to search this generation tree, notably the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which provides theoretical guarantees on the search efficiency, but also simpler methods based on re-ranking a pool of diverse sequences using the discriminator scores. These methods are evaluated, with automatic and human-based metrics, on two types of constraints and languages: review polarity and emotion control in French and English. We show that discriminator-guided MCTS decoding achieves state-of-the-art results without having to tune the language model, in both tasks and languages.

Even when considerable quantities of text are present on the web, \ufb01nding this text, and distinguishing it from related languages in the same region can be dif\ufb01cult. For example less dominant variants of English (e.g. New Zealander, Singaporean, Canadian, Irish, South African) may be found under their respective national domains, but will be partially mixed with Englishes of the British and US varieties, perhaps through syndication of journalism, or the local reuse of text by multinational companies. Less formal dialectal usage may be scattered more widely over the internet through mechanisms such as wiki or blog authoring. Here we automatically construct a corpus of Hiberno-English (English as spoken in Ireland) using a variety of methods: \ufb01ltering by national domain, \ufb01ltering by orthographic conventions, and bootstrapping from a set of Irelandspeci\ufb01c terms (slang, place names, organisations).

However, these existing methods on MPC usually represent interlocutors and utterances individually and ignore the inherent complicated structure in MPC which may provide crucial interlocutor and utterance semantics and would enhance the conversation understanding process. To this end, we present <MASKED_ACRONYM>, a pre-trained model for MPC understanding that considers learning who says what to whom in a unified model with several elaborated self-supervised tasks. Particularly, these tasks can be generally categorized into (1) interlocutor structure modeling including reply-to utterance recognition, identical speaker searching and pointer consistency distinction, and (2) utterance semantics modeling including masked shared utterance restoration and shared node detection. We evaluate <MASKED_ACRONYM> on three downstream tasks including addressee recognition, speaker identification and response selection. Experimental results show that <MASKED_ACRONYM> outperforms previous methods by large margins and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on all three downstream tasks at two benchmarks.","wordlikeness":0.625,"lcsratio":0.75,"wordcoverage":0.6666666667}

Traditional lexical knowledge bases such as WordNet formalize a limited set of systematic relations among words, such as synonymy, polysemy and hypernymy. Such relations maintain their systematicity when composed into lexical chains. We claim that such relations cannot explain the type of lexical associations common in poetic text. We explore in this paper the usage of Word Association Norms (WANs) as an alternative lexical knowledge source to analyze linguistic computational creativity. We speci\ufb01cally investigate the Haiku poetic genre, which is characterized by heavy reliance on lexical associations. We \ufb01rst compare the density of WAN-based word associations in a corpus of English Haiku poems to that of WordNet-based associations as well as in other non-poetic genres. These experiments con\ufb01rm our hypothesis that the non-systematic lexical associations captured in WANs play an important role in poetic text. We then present <MASKED_ACRONYM>, a system to automatically generate Haikus from a seed word and using WAN-associations.

Despite the remarkable progress achieved in the past several years, most research efforts focus on detecting events from formal texts (e.g., news articles, Wikipedia documents, financial announcements). Moreover, the texts in each dataset are either from a single source or multiple yet relatively homogeneous sources. With massive amounts of user-generated text accumulating on the Web and inside enterprises, identifying meaningful events in these informal texts, usually from multiple heterogeneous sources, has become a problem of significant practical value. As a pioneering exploration that expands event detection to the scenarios involving informal and heterogeneous texts, we propose a new large-scale Chinese event detection dataset based on user reviews, text conversations, and phone conversations in a leading e-commerce platform for food service.

The system is capable of 'noticing' ambiguity  because it requires that there be a unique  antecedent within a salience ranking, and the  salience rankings are not total orders, i.e. two or  more antecedents can be equally salient.

However, Transformer and its existing variants may not be optimal in capturing token distances because the position or distance embeddings used by these methods usually cannot keep the precise information of real distances, which may not be beneficial for modeling the orders and relations of contexts. In this paper, we propose <MASKED_ACRONYM>, which is a distance-aware Transformer that can exploit the real distance. We propose to incorporate the real distances between tokens to re-scale the raw self-attention weights, which are computed by the relevance between attention query and key. Concretely, in different self-attention heads the relative distance between each pair of tokens is weighted by different learnable parameters, which control the different preferences on long- or short-term information of these heads. Since the raw weighted real distances may not be optimal for adjusting self-attention weights, we propose a learnable sigmoid function to map them into re-scaled coefficients that have proper ranges. We first clip the raw self-attention weights via the ReLU function to keep non-negativity and introduce sparsity, and then multiply them with the re-scaled coefficients to encode real distance information into self-attention. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that <MASKED_ACRONYM> can effectively improve the performance of many tasks and outperform the vanilla Transformer and its several variants.","wordlikeness":0.7142857143,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":0.8461538462}

Current models with state-of-the-art performance have been able to generate the correct questions corresponding to the answers. However, most models can not ensure the complexity of generated questions, so they may generate shallow questions that can be answered without multi-hop reasoning. To address this challenge, we propose the <MASKED_ACRONYM>, which is a simple and effective controlled framework. <MASKED_ACRONYM> employs a simple method to generate the multi-hop questions that contain key entities in multi-hop reasoning chains, which ensure the complexity and quality of the questions. In addition, we introduce a novel controlled Transformer-based decoder to guarantee that key entities appear in the questions.

To enhance corpus based word embedding models, researchers utilize domain knowledge to learn more distinguishable representations via joint optimization and post-processing based models. However, joint optimization based models require much training time. Existing post-processing models mostly consider semantic knowledge while learned embedding models show less functional information. Glossary is a comprehensive linguistic resource. And in previous works, the glossary is usually used to enhance the word representations via joint optimization based methods. In this paper, we post-process pre-trained word embedding models with incorporating the glossary and capture more topical and functional information. We propose <MASKED_ACRONYM> (Glossary Guided Post-processing word embedding) model which consists of a global post-processing function to fine-tune each word vector, and an auto-encoding model to learn sense representations, furthermore, constrains each post-processed word representation and the composition of its sense representations to be similar. We evaluate our model by comparing it with two state-of-the-art models on six word topical\/functional similarity datasets, and the results show that it outperforms competitors by an average of 4.1% across all datasets.

We analyse the resource along the perspectives induced by the diversity of the annotators, in terms of origin, age, and gender, and the relationship between these dimensions, irony, and the topics of conversation. We validate <MASKED_ACRONYM> by creating perspective-aware models that encode the perspectives of annotators grouped according to their demographic characteristics. Firstly, the performance of perspectivist models confirms that different annotators induce very different models. Secondly, in the classification of ironic and non-ironic texts, perspectivist models prove to be generally more confident than the non-perspectivist ones. Furthermore, comparing the performance on a perspective-based test set with those achieved on a gold standard test set, we can observe how perspectivist models tend to detect more precisely the positive class, showing their ability to capture the different perceptions of irony. Thanks to these models, we are moreover able to show interesting insights about the variation in the perception of irony by the different groups of annotators, such as among different generations and nationalities.","wordlikeness":1.0,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":1.0}

Specifically, most of the well-performed metrics are required to train on evaluation datasets of specific NLG tasks and evaluation dimensions, which may cause over-fitting to task-specific datasets. Furthermore, existing metrics only provide an evaluation score for each dimension without revealing the evidence to interpret how this score is obtained. To deal with these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective metric called <MASKED_ACRONYM>. This metric formulates NLG evaluation as an instruction-style question answering task and utilizes instruction-tuned pre-trained language models (PLMs) without training on evaluation datasets, aiming to enhance the generalization ability. To make the evaluation process more interpretable, we decompose our devised instruction-style question about the quality of generated texts into the subquestions that measure the quality of each sentence. The subquestions with their answers generated by PLMs are then recomposed as evidence to obtain the evaluation result.

In this paper, we introduce Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Pre-training (<MASKED_ACRONYM>) in order to learn a unified sentiment representation for multiple sentiment analysis tasks. With the help of automatically-mined knowledge, <MASKED_ACRONYM> conducts sentiment masking and constructs three sentiment knowledge prediction objectives, so as to embed sentiment information at the word, polarity and aspect level into pre-trained sentiment representation. In particular, the prediction of aspect-sentiment pairs is converted into multi-label classification, aiming to capture the dependency between words in a pair.

For the dataset, we categorize 3 types of problems on the procedure level, step level and state change level respectively, and build a clean dataset <MASKED_ACRONYM> using multiple rounds of human judgment. For the evaluation metric, we propose a cluster-based metric to fix the original metric\u2019s preference for repetition. Model-wise, we enhance the seq2seq generation baseline by reinstating two key properties for state tracking: temporal dependency and entity awareness. The state of the world after an action is inherently dependent on the previous state. We model this dependency through a dynamic memory bank and allow the model to attend to the memory slots during decoding. On the other hand, the state of the world is naturally a union of the states of involved entities. Since the entities are unknown in the open-vocabulary setting, we propose a two-stage model that refines the state change prediction conditioned on entities predicted from the first stage.

In this paper, we propose a human attention guided approach to identifying and mitigating shortcut learning, which encourages the LLM-based target model to learn relevant features. We define an attention-based measurement to capture both model and data bias and identify shortcut tokens by exploring both human and neural attention. In a self-distillation framework, we mitigate shortcut learning by dynamically adjusting the distillation temperature according to the detected shortcut tokens and estimated shortcut degree. Additionally, we utilize human attention as a supervisory signal to constrain large language models to pay more attention to relevant tokens. Experimental results on multiple NLP tasks show that our proposed method can effectively identify shortcut tokens, and significantly improve the robustness of large language models on OOD samples, while not undermining the performance on IID data.","wordlikeness":0.4285714286,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":0.7692307692}

However, much of this work only relies on the shared vocabulary and bilingual contexts to encourage the correlation across languages, which is loose and implicit for aligning the contextual representations between languages. In this paper, we plug a cross-attention module into the Transformer encoder to explicitly build the interdependence between languages. It can effectively avoid the degeneration of predicting masked words only conditioned on the context in its own language. More importantly, when fine-tuning on downstream tasks, the cross-attention module can be plugged in or out on-demand, thus naturally benefiting a wider range of cross-lingual tasks, from language understanding to generation. As a result, the proposed cross-lingual model delivers new state-of-the-art results on various cross-lingual understanding tasks of the XTREME benchmark, covering text classification, sequence labeling, question answering, and sentence retrieval.

In this paper, we propose a method named Ethicist for targeted training data extraction through loss smoothed soft prompting and calibrated confidence estimation, investigating how to recover the suffix in the training data when given a prefix. To elicit memorization in the attacked model, we tune soft prompt embeddings while keeping the model fixed.

Crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, have been an effective method for collecting such large amounts of data. However, difficulties arise when task-based dialogues require expert domain knowledge or rapid access to domain-relevant information, such as databases for tourism. This will become even more prevalent as dialogue systems become increasingly ambitious, expanding into tasks with high levels of complexity that require collaboration and forward planning, such as in our domain of emergency response. In this paper, we propose <MASKED_ACRONYM>: a framework for collecting real-time Wizard of Oz dialogues through crowdsourcing for collaborative, complex tasks. This framework uses semi-guided dialogue to avoid interactions that breach procedures and processes only known to experts, while enabling the capture of a wide variety of interactions.","wordlikeness":0.4,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":0.6666666667}

However, two primary considerations are not accounted for, the language of the demographic affected and a combination of the topics mentioned above in a fine-grained classification mechanism. In this paper, we create a dataset of 3144 tweets, which are selected based on the presence of colloquial slang related to smoking and analyze it based on the semantics of the tweet. Each class is created and annotated based on the content of the tweets such that further hierarchical methods can be easily applied. Further, we prove the efficacy of standard text classification methods on this dataset, by designing experiments which do both binary as well as multi-class classification. Our experiments tackle the identification of either a specific topic (such as tobacco product promotion), a general mention (cigarettes and related products) or a more fine-grained classification. This methodology paves the way for further analysis, such as understanding sentiment or style, which makes this dataset a vital contribution to both disease surveillance and tobacco use research.","wordlikeness":0.8571428571,"lcsratio":0.4285714286,"wordcoverage":0.8571428571}

An opinion about an entity is an opinion about the entity as a whole, while an opinion about an aspect is just an opinion about that speci\ufb01c attribute or aspect of an entity. Thus, opinion targets should be separated into entities and aspects before use because they represent very different things about opinions.

Generally, contrastive learning pulls distortions of a single sample (i.e., positive samples) close and push negative samples far away, correspondingly facilitating the alignment and uniformity in the feature space. A popular alternative to the \u201cpushing\u201d operation is whitening the feature space, which scatters all the samples for uniformity. Since the whitening and the contrastive learning have large redundancy w.r.t. the uniformity, they are usually used separately and do not easily work together. For the first time, this paper integrates whitening into the contrastive learning scheme and facilitates two benefits. 1) Better uniformity. We find that these two approaches are not totally redundant but actually have some complementarity due to different uniformity mechanism. 2) Better alignment. We randomly divide the feature into multiple groups along the channel axis and perform whitening independently within each group. By shuffling the group division, we derive multiple distortions of a single sample and thus increase the positive sample diversity. Consequently, using multiple positive samples with enhanced diversity further improves contrastive learning due to better alignment. Extensive experiments on seven semantic textual similarity tasks show our method achieves consistent improvement over the contrastive learning baseline and sets new states of the art, e.g., 78.78% (+2.53% based on BERT{pasted macro \u2018BA\u2019}) Spearman correlation on STS tasks.","wordlikeness":0.4545454545,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":0.7058823529}

Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to extract the aspects of the given target entities and their respective sentiments. Prior works formulate this as a sequence tagging problem or solve this task using a span-based extract-then-classify framework where first all the opinion targets are extracted from the sentence, and then with the help of span representations, the targets are classified as positive, negative, or neutral.

Memory-based  learning is a form of supervised learning based on similarity-based reasoning. The part  of speech tag of a word in a particular context is extrapolated from the most similar  cases held in memory. Supervised learning approaches are useful when a tagged corpus  is available as an example of the desired output of the tagger. Based on such a corpus,  the tagger-generator automatically builds a tagger which is able to tag new text the  same way, diminishing development time for the construction of a tagger considerably.  Memory-based tagging shares this advantage with other statistical or machine learning  approaches. Additional advantages specific to a memory-based approach include (i) the  relatively small tagged corpus size sufficient for training, (ii) incremental learning, (iii)  explanation capabilities, (iv) flexible integration of information in case representations,  (v) its non-parametric nature, (vi) reasonably good results on unknown words without  morphological analysis, and (vii) fast learning and tagging.

The latest approaches focus on global planning, which plans toward the target before the conversation instead of adopting a greedy strategy during the conversation. However, the global plan in existing works is fixed to certain turns by generating paths with certain nodes, which limits the optimization of turns and coherence of the target-oriented process. Toward flexible global planning, we propose to generate a global path as a natural language sentence instead of a sequence of nodes. With this path, the dialog is guided to the target with flexible turns of dialog. For model training, we also extract targetoriented dialogues from the chit-chat corpus with a knowledge graph. We conduct experiments on three datasets and simulate scenarios with and without user participation.

So, we introduce a new task - DST from dialogue between users about scheduling an event (DST-USERS). The DST-USERS task is much more challenging since it requires the model to understand and track dialogue states in the dialogue between users, as well as to understand who suggested the schedule and who agreed to the proposed schedule. To facilitate DST-USERS research, we develop dialogue datasets between users that plan a schedule. The annotated slot values which need to be extracted in the dialogue are date, time, and location. Previous approaches, such as Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) and traditional DST techniques, have not achieved good results in our extensive evaluations.

First, we show that initially training a model on short subsequences before moving on to longer ones both reduces overall training time and, surprisingly, substantially improves perplexity. Second, we show how to improve the efficiency of recurrence methods in transformers, which let models condition on previously processed tokens when generating sequences that exceed the maximal length the transformer can handle at once. Existing methods require computationally expensive relative position embeddings; we introduce a simple alternative of adding absolute position embeddings to queries and keys instead of to word embeddings, which efficiently produces superior results. We show that these recurrent models also benefit from short input lengths.

The main reason is that the cross-attention module between the encoder and decoder cannot be pre-trained, and the combined encoder-decoder model cannot work well in the fine-tuning stage because the inputs of the decoder cross-attention come from unknown encoder outputs. In this paper, we propose a better pre-training method for NMT by defining a semantic interface (<MASKED_ACRONYM>) between the pre-trained encoder and the pre-trained decoder. Specifically, we propose two types of semantic interfaces, including CL-<MASKED_ACRONYM> which regards cross-lingual embeddings as an interface, and VQ-<MASKED_ACRONYM> which employs vector quantized embeddings to constrain the encoder outputs and decoder inputs in the same language-independent space.

Among the linguistic annotations, POS (part-of-speech) tag annotations are indispensable in speech corpora for most modern spoken language applications of morphologically complex agglutinative languages such as Korean. Considering the above demands, we have developed a single uni\ufb01ed speech corpus annotation tool that enables corpus builders to link linguistic annotations to signal-level annotations using a morphological analyzer and a POS tagger as basic morpheme-based linguistic engines. Our tool integrates a syntactic analyzer, phrase break detector, grapheme-to-phoneme converter and automatic phonetic aligner together. Each engine automatically annotates its own linguistic and signal knowledge, and interacts with the corpus developers to revise and correct the annotations on demand. All the linguistic\/phonetic engines were developed and merged with an interactive visualization tool in a client-server network communication model. The corpora that can be constructed using our annotation tool are multi-purpose and applicable to both speech recognition and text-tospeech (TTS) systems.

However, the most valuable text is often difficult to extract consistently due to substantial variations in how content can appear from document to document. Thus, the most successful way to extract this content has been through costly crowdsourcing and training of manual workers. We propose the Assisted Neural Text Segmentation (<MASKED_ACRONYM>) framework to identify pertinent text in unstructured documents from a small set of labeled examples. <MASKED_ACRONYM> leverages deep learning and transfer learning architectures to empower researchers to identify relevant text with minimal manual coding. Using a real world sample of accounting documents, we identify targeted sections 96% of the time using only 5 training examples.","wordlikeness":1.0,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":0.8888888889}

Neural generative models have shown promising results for various text generation problems. Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) models are typically trained to generate a single output sequence for a given input sequence. However, in the context of a story, multiple endings are possible. Seq2Seq models tend to ignore the context and generate generic and dull responses. Very few works have studied generating diverse and interesting story endings for the same story context. In this paper, we propose models which generate more diverse and interesting outputs by 1) training models to focus attention on important keyphrases of the story, and 2) promoting generating nongeneric words. We show that the combination of the two leads to more interesting endings.","wordlikeness":0.7692307692,"lcsratio":0.7692307692,"wordcoverage":0.75}

However, the existing pre-trained language models rarely consider incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which can provide rich structured knowledge facts for better language understanding. We argue that informative entities in KGs can enhance language representation with external knowledge. In this paper, we utilize both large-scale textual corpora and KGs to train an enhanced language representation model (<MASKED_ACRONYM>), which can take full advantage of lexical, syntactic, and knowledge information simultaneously. The experimental results have demonstrated that <MASKED_ACRONYM> achieves significant improvements on various knowledge-driven tasks, and meanwhile is comparable with the state-of-the-art model BERT on other common NLP tasks.

Existing benchmarks for natural language processing (NLP) usually focus only on understanding or generating short texts. However, long text modeling requires many distinct abilities in contrast to short texts, such as the modeling of long-range discourse and commonsense relations, and the coherence and controllability of generation. The lack of standardized benchmarks makes it difficult to assess these abilities of a model and fairly compare different models, especially Chinese models. Therefore, we propose a story-centric benchmark named <MASKED_ACRONYM> for evaluating Chinese long text modeling, which aggregates two understanding tasks and two generation tasks. We construct new datasets for these tasks based on human-written Chinese stories with hundreds of words. Furthermore, we release an encoder-decoder-based Chinese long text pretraining model named LongLM with up to 1 billion parameters. We pretrain LongLM on 120G Chinese novels with two generative tasks including text infilling and conditional continuation. Extensive experiments show that LongLM outperforms similar-sized pretraining models substantially on both the understanding and generation tasks in <MASKED_ACRONYM>.","wordlikeness":1.0,"lcsratio":1.0,"wordcoverage":1.0}

However, prior work has not explored how these methods can be integrated to combine their complementary advantages. We overcome this limitation by introducing <MASKED_ACRONYM> (ContRastive Edits with Sparse raTionalization), a joint framework for selective rationalization and counterfactual text generation, and show that this framework leads to improvements in counterfactual quality, model robustness, and interpretability. First, <MASKED_ACRONYM> generates valid counterfactuals that are more natural than those produced by previous methods, and subsequently can be used for data augmentation at scale, reducing the need for human-generated examples. Second, we introduce a new loss function that leverages <MASKED_ACRONYM> counterfactuals to regularize selective rationales and show that this regularization improves both model robustness and rationale quality, compared to methods that do not leverage <MASKED_ACRONYM> counterfactuals. Our results demonstrate that <MASKED_ACRONYM> successfully bridges the gap between selective rationales and counterfactual examples, addressing the limitations of existing methods and providing a more comprehensive view of a model\u2019s predictions.","wordlikeness":1.0,"lcsratio":0.8,"wordcoverage":1.0}

As expected, this is higher than the corresponding error rates in two publicly available MT systems that we used for comparison. Contrary to our expectations, the error rates of our prototype is also higher than the error rates of a comparable system based solely on Apertium modules. Based on error analysis, we conclude that better translation quality may be achieved by replacing only the tagging component of Apertium with the corresponding module in IceNLP, but leaving morphological analysis to Apertium.","wordlikeness":0.4666666667,"lcsratio":0.6,"wordcoverage":0.6086956522}

In this paper, we introduce a new dataset called Commonsense Reasoning for Counterfactual Scene Imagination (<MASKED_ACRONYM>) which is designed to evaluate the ability of AI systems to reason about scene change imagination. To be specific, in this multimodal task\/dataset, models are given an image and an initial question-response pair about the image. Next, a counterfactual imagined scene change (in textual form) is applied, and the model has to predict the new response to the initial question based on this scene change. We collect 3.5K high-quality and challenging data instances, with each instance consisting of an image, a commonsense question with a response, a description of a counterfactual change, a new response to the question, and three distractor responses. Our dataset contains various complex scene change types (such as object addition\/removal\/state change, event description, environment change, etc.) that require models to imagine many different scenarios and reason about the changed scenes. We present a baseline model based on a vision-language Transformer (i.e., LXMERT) and ablation studies.

Such reasoning goes beyond just visual recognition. To enable both commonsense and factual reasoning in the image search, we present a unified framework namely Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Transformer (KRAMT) that treats the named visual entities in an image as a gateway to encyclopedic knowledge and leverages them along with natural language query to ground relevant knowledge.
